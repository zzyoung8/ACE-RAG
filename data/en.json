{"doc_id": 4, "question": "What is the name of the only concert grand piano that survived in Gaza?", "answer": ["The Yamaha concert grand"], "doc": "There is one image that keeps a Gaza musician going like no other - that of the territory’s only concert grand piano.Khamis Abu Shaban had finally risked returning to the music school at which he taught - and which owns the piano - a few months into the current conflict.What he saw, at the Gaza branch of the Palestinian music school, the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music, was “a catastrophe”.“More than half of the Conservatory was burned. All the instruments were broken, thrown outside. You start seeing cases of instruments as soon as you get close to the Conservatory on the streets. Violins, we had more than 50, completely smashed. Cellos, more than 40, completely smashed.”\nAltogether, the Gaza branch of the Conservatory used to have more than 400 instruments - both Western classical ones and traditional Arabic instruments such as the oud, qanun and nay, a type of flute. Khamis says he felt “completely destroyed”.But then he saw something which lifted his spirits.“The only… instrument that I saw standing was the grand piano. Honestly, I smiled when I saw it. I smiled and I laughed.”\nThe Yamaha concert grand also withstood bombing in a previous war between Israel and Gaza’s rulers - Hamas - in 2014, and was carefully restored the following year by a French music technician. It became a symbol for many of aspirations that the territory could develop a flourishing musical culture.“I started talking to the piano,” says Khamis. “I asked: ‘Are you the only survivor of all the instruments? You don't want to die?’ I really laughed.”\nSinging in GazaTim Whewell reported from Gaza in 2015 on the rescue of the territory’s only concert grand piano after a previous war. Now, he finds out how musicians he met then are living and working through this war. He learns about a boy who started playing the violin after he lost his hand in an airstrike. And he finds out about the second near-miraculous survival of the grand piano.Listen on BBC Sounds \nIt is too dangerous for the teachers and students to resume lessons at the music school, because of Israeli military operations in the area around it in north-west Gaza. Instead, they have started giving music lessons to tens of thousands of displaced children living in the makeshift camps where many Gazans now reside.They teach outdoors, under canvas awnings, or in schools and shelters run by UNRWA, the United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees.\n“Life goes on, and even with all this death around us, people need anything that can make them… not happy - no-one will be happy in this period - but something that can make them smile, be able to continue with life,” Khamis says.The teachers - who are using whatever borrowed instruments they can find - include former students of the Conservatory, such as 16-year-old violinist Sama Nijim. One of her students is Mohammed Abu Eideh, a boy who lost his right hand in an airstrike.He used to play the oud - his favourite instrument - but this requires two hands. So Sama devised a way for him to learn violin instead - by tying a violin bow to his arm with a scarf, so that he could bow without the use of a hand.\nSuch versatility on the part of the staff can also be seen in teacher Osama Jahjouh’s fashioning of a nay - or traditional flute - out of a plastic pipe, because the Conservatory nays have been lost.Fuad Khader, who created a children’s choir in Jabaliya refugee camp in the north of Gaza, says that at first it was difficult to persuade parents to let their children take part in the activities.“They asked: ‘People are dying, and you want to teach kids to sing?’” he says. “But I just told them: ‘Everyone has to do something. I’m a musician. And this is my job.’”Another teacher, Ahmed Abu Amsha, says the music lessons had a transformative effect on the children.“After a week, the families came to me and told me: ‘You have changed our kids.

{"doc_id": 4, "question": "How many instruments did the Gaza branch of the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music have before the conflict?", "answer": ["More than 400"], "doc": "There is one image that keeps a Gaza musician going like no other - that of the territory’s only concert grand piano.Khamis Abu Shaban had finally risked returning to the music school at which he taught - and which owns the piano - a few months into the current conflict.What he saw, at the Gaza branch of the Palestinian music school, the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music, was “a catastrophe”.“More than half of the Conservatory was burned. All the instruments were broken, thrown outside. You start seeing cases of instruments as soon as you get close to the Conservatory on the streets. Violins, we had more than 50, completely smashed. Cellos, more than 40, completely smashed.”\nAltogether, the Gaza branch of the Conservatory used to have more than 400 instruments - both Western classical ones and traditional Arabic instruments such as the oud, qanun and nay, a type of flute. Khamis says he felt “completely destroyed”.But then he saw something which lifted his spirits.“The only… instrument that I saw standing was the grand piano. Honestly, I smiled when I saw it. I smiled and I laughed.”\nThe Yamaha concert grand also withstood bombing in a previous war between Israel and Gaza’s rulers - Hamas - in 2014, and was carefully restored the following year by a French music technician. It became a symbol for many of aspirations that the territory could develop a flourishing musical culture.“I started talking to the piano,” says Khamis. “I asked: ‘Are you the only survivor of all the instruments? You don't want to die?’ I really laughed.”\nSinging in GazaTim Whewell reported from Gaza in 2015 on the rescue of the territory’s only concert grand piano after a previous war. Now, he finds out how musicians he met then are living and working through this war. He learns about a boy who started playing the violin after he lost his hand in an airstrike. And he finds out about the second near-miraculous survival of the grand piano.Listen on BBC Sounds \nIt is too dangerous for the teachers and students to resume lessons at the music school, because of Israeli military operations in the area around it in north-west Gaza. Instead, they have started giving music lessons to tens of thousands of displaced children living in the makeshift camps where many Gazans now reside.They teach outdoors, under canvas awnings, or in schools and shelters run by UNRWA, the United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees.\n“Life goes on, and even with all this death around us, people need anything that can make them… not happy - no-one will be happy in this period - but something that can make them smile, be able to continue with life,” Khamis says.The teachers - who are using whatever borrowed instruments they can find - include former students of the Conservatory, such as 16-year-old violinist Sama Nijim. One of her students is Mohammed Abu Eideh, a boy who lost his right hand in an airstrike.He used to play the oud - his favourite instrument - but this requires two hands. So Sama devised a way for him to learn violin instead - by tying a violin bow to his arm with a scarf, so that he could bow without the use of a hand.\nSuch versatility on the part of the staff can also be seen in teacher Osama Jahjouh’s fashioning of a nay - or traditional flute - out of a plastic pipe, because the Conservatory nays have been lost.Fuad Khader, who created a children’s choir in Jabaliya refugee camp in the north of Gaza, says that at first it was difficult to persuade parents to let their children take part in the activities.“They asked: ‘People are dying, and you want to teach kids to sing?’” he says. “But I just told them: ‘Everyone has to do something. I’m a musician. And this is my job.’”Another teacher, Ahmed Abu Amsha, says the music lessons had a transformative effect on the children.“After a week, the families came to me and told me: ‘You have changed our kids. They are getting better. They are singing, they are laughing.’”\nBut he adds: “Sometimes we are singing a song - and suddenly there's a big explosion, that makes us go silent and look at each other. And I say: ‘Don't worry, let's continue.’ I have to be strong in front of the children. And in some moments, they forget they are in a war.“But when they go, I'm not strong,” he says.“It’s like I’m sucking the bad energy from the kids.

Head gardener Tim Parker, who oversees the 18 acres of lake and 30 acres of land, said the colours of leaves have changed \"overnight\".He said: \"It looks a bit like a painting at the moment, we're stood in a painting.\"\nGarden owner and designer, Henry Hoare II  was said to have been one of a small group of \"gentleman gardeners\" who used their large estates to create a personal landscape.He was inspired by his travels around Europe and, while Stourhead's garden has developed over the centuries, those original inspirations can still be seen today.\nMr Parker said leaves now sounded and smelled different, as well as changing colour. \"The sound as you walk - you’ve got this nice crunch,\" he said. \"There are different smells, that earthly smell of leaves on the ground.\"We’ve got our Kasturi trees and some people say they catch this real candyfloss scent,\" he added. \"It’s intoxicating.\"\nThe head gardener said the team had seen a \"strong growing season\" despite the weather.He said: \"The rain made everything grow - we haven't stopped weeding - and it has helped with our tree planting exercise earlier in the year so they've taken really well.\"It feels like autumn came fairly promptly this year,\" he added. \"We are seeing great colour and we've got mist coming through which creates another effect.\" \nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

{"doc_id": 22, "question": "What is the name of Bruce Springsteen’s new Disney+ documentary?", "answer": ["Road Diary"], "doc": "“The louder you can talk, the better, because I've played rock and roll for 50 years.”Bruce Springsteen has just E Street Shuffled into the room. Uncannily charismatic, he carries the practised ease of someone who knows the destabilising effect their presence can have on regular people.He takes time to greet every member of the BBC's film crew individually, then breaks the ice with a joke about a journalist who mistakenly called him “Springstein”. That reminds me of a local radio DJ in Belfast who always used to introduce him as “Bruce Springsprong”.“Really?” he laughs. “Well, I’ve been called worse.”In fact, we've been pre-warned that he doesn't like being called The Boss – the nickname coined in the early days of his career with The E Street Band, when he'd be responsible for collecting and distributing the takings after a show.“I hate being called 'Boss',\" he told Creem magazine in 1980. \"Always did, from the beginning. I hate bosses. I hate being called the boss.”The term is conspicuously absent from his new Disney+ documentary, Road Diary, which charts the process of putting together Springsteen’s first tour since the pandemic – from handwritten notebooks to footage of his band “shaking off the cobwebs” after six years apart.At times, the preparations lack the rigour you might expect.“It’s all a little bit casual,” frets Steve Van Zandt, Springsteen’s guitarist and one of his oldest friends, after the star calls time on rehearsals.“There’s a certain percentage [of songs] that we’re gonna [screw] up anyway,” Springsteen retorts. “That’s what they’re paying for. They want to see it live. That means a few mistakes!”\nIf you’ve caught any of the star’s recent shows, you'll know the stakes are never that high. The band are tighter than a tourniquet. Mistakes are noticeably absent.The documentary comes exactly 60 years after Springsteen’s first gig, playing an $18 guitar with a band called The Rogues. He’s never let anyone film the inner workings of his shows before, so why do it on this tour?“Well, because I could be dead by the next one,” he laughs. “I'm 75 years old now. I've decided that the waiting-to-do-things part of my life is over.\"“We're closer to the end than we are to the beginning,” agrees Van Zandt, “but the point of this tour was that we’re not going out quietly, man.“We're going to balance that mortality with vitality.That philosophy was fully on display at Sunderland’s Stadium of Light in May, when Springsteen braved torrential rain to play for three hours to 50,000 drenched fans.The weather was so brutal that Springsteen lost his voice. Doctors ordered him not to sing for a week, forcing him to postpone several shows.What made him continue?“Well, I'm there to have a good time,” he says. “I'm going to insist on it, whether it's raining or the sun is shining - because I'm there for the people that are there.“I look out and I go, ‘These are my people. These are the people who've listened to my music for the past 30 or 40 years. I'm going to do the best show I possibly can', you know?“It sounds corny, but you have to love your audience and, for the most part, I've never found that hard to do.”\nIt took audiences a while to reciprocate, however.Born in New Jersey, to Douglas Springsteen, a bus driver, and Adele Springsteen, a secretary, Bruce paid little attention to music until he saw Elvis Presley on the Ed Sullivan Show and bought himself a guitar.He spent his teens playing around the city with a Beatles-inspired band named The Castiles (after a brand of shampoo), taking gigs wherever they’d have him.“I've played pizza parlours, I've played bowling alleys. I’ve played [psychiatric] hospitals and Sing Sing prison. I even played a supermarket opening once,” he recalls.\nBack then, the setlist was all R&B covers and Motown hits - but Springsteen was a nervous performer. In his autobiography, he talks about blinking 100 times a minute and chewing his knuckles. Van Zandt calls him “the most introverted guy you’ve met in your whole life\".So how did he become the performer who, with the E Street Band, started tearing up stages all around the world?“Introversion is a funny thing,” he says. “There's a yin and a yang to it.“On my own, I can be very internal. I've written a lot of internal music - Darkness On The Edge Of Town, Nebraska, parts of The River - all about people who live these very intense, borderline violent, internal lives.“But the joyful side of me, which I got from my mother, allows me to sing Rosalita and Born to Run and Hungry Heart. \"I'm Irish-Italian, so I got the blues and I got the joy at the same time.”It’s a typical Springsteen answer – analytical, sincere, intrinsically linking his life to his music. Van Zandt, who witnessed Springsteen’s transformation, sees it differently.“His first two records didn’t do well. Record companies were ready to drop him. His only dream was about to die. “So my very shy friend reaches inside and says, ‘I'll put the guitar down and start fronting the band', which is huge move, right? Because the guitar's a defence, it’s actually a wall between you and your audience. So he had to put that away and learn a whole new craft.”It all came to a head at New York's Bottom Line Club, shortly before the release of Springsteen’s breakout album Born To Run in 1975.Over the course of five nights and 10 shows, the star showcased his new sound to fans, journalists and radio progammers.\"And all of a sudden, he’s dancing on the tables,” Van Zandt recalls. “I’m like, ‘Wow, where'd that come from?’“I think it was sort of a defensive urge, like, ‘You're not going to stop me’.”\nWhatever it was, it worked. Born To Run was a massive commercial success, selling six million copies in the US alone.The album was constructed with the same desperation as those live shows, pieced together over 14 months (six of them on the title track alone) as Springsteen fought and scraped to save his career.The songs – Thunder Road, Jungleland, Born To Run – throbbed with longing, as his characters fought to escape the confines of small-town, blue collar American life.It's a story he was familiar with. As a child, he witnessed the chilling effects of unemployment and the Vietnam War on his neighbourhood.His subsequent rise to fame reads like a movie treatment for the American Dream, but he’s aware that luck and timing played a role.\n“I wouldn't want to be a young band starting today,” he says. “The day of the quote ‘rock star’ is in twilight.\"But I've had some encouragement. My young friend, Zach Bryan, just sold out two stadium nights in Philadelphia, so there's still some young people coming up.\"Watch the full Bruce Springsteen interview on BBC iPlayerNo-one can match Springsteen, though, and he's increasingly aware that time's against him.His last two albums confront mortality head-on, prompted by the realisation that he was the “last man standing” from his teenage band The Castiles.On tour, he pays tribute to the E Street musicians who’ve crossed The River. Meanwhile his wife, Patti Scialfa, has cut back her appearances with the band, after being diagnosed with myeloma, a rare blood cancer, in 2018.“She's doing well, we caught it early,” Springsteen says.“She's having a tough time at the moment because she needs to have a shoulder replaced and a hip replaced. So that, on top of the myeloma, makes it very difficult for her to get out and get around.“But she's made a beautiful new record that'll be coming out, hopefully, this year. And we’ve been married for 34 years. I love her to death.”\nDespite the realities of age, Springsteen isn't slowing down. He’s back in Europe next summer to make up for the concerts he missed after Sunderland, adding another 12 dates for good measure.“Do you think you can outlast The E Street Band?”, he demands every night, daring the audience to meet their energy, joule for joule.Their shared history is the show's heartbeat. Famously, they'll take requests from the audience, often playing other artists' songs at the drop of a hat. Springsteen traces that ability back to their early club gigs. \"I know every song these guys have ever played, so I’ll go, ‘Oh yeah, we played that back in 1964, I think we can fake our way through that one’.\"And the secret to their 50-year camaraderie? Distance.“When we're not playing, we rarely see each other,” Springsteen confesses. “We've seen each other enough!\"He continues: “The arc of most bands is to break apart. \"Even two guys can't stay together. Simon can’t stand Garfunkel, Don couldn’t stand Phil Everly, and then you have the kids in Oasis... so the tradition carries on.“It’s the nature of people to not get along, so that’s something you need to write into your projection of the kind of band you want to be in.“I don't like drama. I don't want people knocking heads. I don't want to hear about a bunch of bull backstage. I don't put up with any of that stuff. We weeded it out a long time ago.“The band started out crazy and made its way to sanity.”In the documentary, Springsteen promises they’ll keep playing “until the wheels come off”. I wonder if that's because, as he's said in the past, the shows help him fend off depression.“I've been pretty lucky with the depression,” he says “It hasn't bothered me in quite a while, but I definitely go on stage to lose myself.“You have to surrender to the moment and see what comes up. Learn a little bit about yourself.”What has he learnt on his latest tour?“Let me see,” he says, leaning back to think.“I learnt that my back really hurts a lot.”\nRoad Diary: Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band premieres on 25 October on Disney+."}

Born To Run was a massive commercial success, selling six million copies in the US alone.The album was constructed with the same desperation as those live shows, pieced together over 14 months (six of them on the title track alone) as Springsteen fought and scraped to save his career.The songs – Thunder Road, Jungleland, Born To Run – throbbed with longing, as his characters fought to escape the confines of small-town, blue collar American life.It's a story he was familiar with. As a child, he witnessed the chilling effects of unemployment and the Vietnam War on his neighbourhood.His subsequent rise to fame reads like a movie treatment for the American Dream, but he’s aware that luck and timing played a role.\n“I wouldn't want to be a young band starting today,” he says. “The day of the quote ‘rock star’ is in twilight.\"But I've had some encouragement. My young friend, Zach Bryan, just sold out two stadium nights in Philadelphia, so there's still some young people coming up.\"Watch the full Bruce Springsteen interview on BBC iPlayerNo-one can match Springsteen, though, and he's increasingly aware that time's against him.His last two albums confront mortality head-on, prompted by the realisation that he was the “last man standing” from his teenage band The Castiles.On tour, he pays tribute to the E Street musicians who’ve crossed The River. Meanwhile his wife, Patti Scialfa, has cut back her appearances with the band, after being diagnosed with myeloma, a rare blood cancer, in 2018.“She's doing well, we caught it early,” Springsteen says.“She's having a tough time at the moment because she needs to have a shoulder replaced and a hip replaced. So that, on top of the myeloma, makes it very difficult for her to get out and get around.“But she's made a beautiful new record that'll be coming out, hopefully, this year. And we’ve been married for 34 years. I love her to death.”\nDespite the realities of age, Springsteen isn't slowing down. He’s back in Europe next summer to make up for the concerts he missed after Sunderland, adding another 12 dates for good measure.“Do you think you can outlast The E Street Band?”, he demands every night, daring the audience to meet their energy, joule for joule.Their shared history is the show's heartbeat. Famously, they'll take requests from the audience, often playing other artists' songs at the drop of a hat. Springsteen traces that ability back to their early club gigs. \"I know every song these guys have ever played, so I’ll go, ‘Oh yeah, we played that back in 1964, I think we can fake our way through that one’.\"And the secret to their 50-year camaraderie? Distance.“When we're not playing, we rarely see each other,” Springsteen confesses. “We've seen each other enough!\"He continues: “The arc of most bands is to break apart. \"Even two guys can't stay together. Simon can’t stand Garfunkel, Don couldn’t stand Phil Everly, and then you have the kids in Oasis... so the tradition carries on.“It’s the nature of people to not get along, so that’s something you need to write into your projection of the kind of band you want to be in.“I don't like drama. I don't want people knocking heads. I don't want to hear about a bunch of bull backstage. I don't put up with any of that stuff. We weeded it out a long time ago.“The band started out crazy and made its way to sanity.”In the documentary, Springsteen promises they’ll keep playing “until the wheels come off”. I wonder if that's because, as he's said in the past, the shows help him fend off depression.“I've been pretty lucky with the depression,” he says “It hasn't bothered me in quite a while, but I definitely go on stage to lose myself.“You have to surrender to the moment and see what comes up. Learn a little bit about yourself.”What has he learnt on his latest tour?“Let me see,” he says, leaning back to think.“I learnt that my back really hurts a lot.”\nRoad Diary: Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band premieres on 25 October on Disney+."}

{"doc_id": 33, "question": "How many British soldiers were massacred by the SS in May 1940?", "answer": ["97"], "doc": "Two helmets belonging to World War Two British soldiers massacred by the SS in May 1940 have been discovered and donated to museums in France and England.Only two men survived the execution out of the 99 soldiers from the 2nd Battalion The Royal Norfolk Regiment, 1st Battalion The Royal Scots and other British Expeditionary Force personnel, who were lined up and machine-gunned.Last year, a French farmer clearing out a barn near the massacre site came across the helmets, which historian Neil Storey confirmed were Royal Norfolk issue. Le Paradis Massacre website historian John Head said relatives of the victims became \"very emotional\" on seeing the helmet due to be displayed in Norwich. \n\"Of the 99 men machine-gunned, 97 did not survive, so if that helmet doesn't belong to [survivors] Bert Pooley and Bill O'Callaghan, it could be the only artefact that has returned home from those who didn't return - that's how important it is,\" he said.\nThe massacre took place on 27 May 1940 when the soldiers, who had fought with little rest or food for 17 days, ran out of ammunition and surrendered at Le Paradis in northern France.They had been ordered to hold back the German advance across France for as long as possible, to enable the evacuation of nearly 340,000 Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk.The men expected to be treated as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions, a series of international treaties designed to protect captured soldiers. Instead, their dog tags were removed and they were lined up and executed on the orders of Capt Fritz Knoechlein, of the 3rd SS Division (Totenkopf).Amazingly, Pte Pooley and Pte O'Callaghan survived the massacre and imprisonment, and were able to bring Knoechlein to justice after the war. \n\"Farmer Jean-Charles Dufour sent me an email last year which just stunned me, saying we've found two helmets when we were clearing up the farm for sale,\" said Mr Head.Mr Storey, a Norfolk-based military historian, was asked to identify them and he confirmed they were World War One issue, which had been repurposed. Mr Head said: \"He could identify a chin strap modification of the helmet when they were fitted with new liners in 1938 to 1939, so we knew it was a World War Two infantry helmet.\"On their sides was a faded yellow oblong with pigments of black, and Neil Storey felt it was an allusion to the puggaree flash which we know was the Norfolk's colours.\"The yellow facing was for the regiment and the black line was for being in mourning for Sir John Moore of the 9th Regiment of Foot, which later became the Norfolks.\"The Lt Gen was fatally wounded at Corunna, Spain, during the Napoleonic Wars.\nThe soldiers had been ordered to pile up their equipment near the barn, including helmets, shortly before they were executed.Two years later, Le Paradis's citizens persuaded the German authorities to let them exhume their bodies and rebury them in the village cemetery.It is believed the rediscovered helmets were among those put on wooden posts surrounding their graves.Mr Head said: \"We agreed to give one helmet to the Le Paradis museum and the Royal Norfolk Regimental Museum in Norwich Castle is to have the other.\"We've also notified the key people in our group, those with direct links to the massacre and whose relative it might have belonged to, and they've seen it and it's been very emotional.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X."}

{"doc_id": 46, "question": "What procedure did doctors perform to give Shamiam Arif two \"fingers\" on each limb?", "answer": ["Krukenberg procedure"], "doc": "Just six months after she was born Shamiam Arif suffered 70% burns to her face, hands and body when a candle fell into her cot at her family's home in Kashmir.The now 22-year-old, who lives in Luton, has just graduated with a degree in film production and is aiming for a career \"doing what I love the most\".\"My mum screamed but the room was already in flames.\" Shamiam recalls of the night that changed the course of her life, shortly after she was born in Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\"My dad grabbed me and ran out of the house while everyone else was putting buckets of water on the fire.” She was not expected to survive.Her parents took her to the local hospital, but it did not have the ability to deal with severe burns. \"They said I was untreatable. They kept bandaging me up and then unbandaging it,\" Shamiam says.\"We were sent five hours away to another hospital, but the damage was already done.”\nHowever, her extended family in Luton started raising awareness of Shamiam’s story in the UK, and enough money was raised, with the support of the Muslim Hands charity, to bring her to the Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, which has a specialist burns unit.\nDoctors rebuilt her skull, face and arms, but she continues to have to wear a helmet.\"The first procedure was my head. It was going from bad to worse, so they had to take half my skull away… I’ll have to wear this protective helmet for the rest of my life,\" she says.Shamiam lost both her hands in the fire, so doctors carried out the Krukenberg procedure which split her forearms to produce two \"fingers\" on each limb.“It’s made a huge difference. I can pick things up, I can write, I can take pictures and use a phone. It gave me independence. I actually declined a bionic hand because I didn’t want it to be robotic,” she says.\nShamiam has also undergone numerous skin grafts to rebuild her face, including working on her eyelids.\"They did an operation so I could blink. My nose was burnt off so they did that. My mouth was all gone. They used skin from my back and legs to fix everything up,\" she says.\nHaving attended Challney High School for Girls in Luton, Shamiam has recently graduated from the University of Hertfordshire with a 2:1 BA in film production.\"At school I was a very independent girl, so if I was going to do something I would do it by myself. I wouldn’t ask for help until I really needed it,\" she says.\"I will now ask team-mates for help so I can still do what I want to do.

{"doc_id": 47, "question": "In which film did Idris Elba play the role of Nelson Mandela?", "answer": ["Long Walk to Freedom"], "doc": "British actor Idris Elba has told the BBC that he will relocate to Africa within the next decade as part of his plans to support the continent’s movie industry.The 52-year-old star of the hit series The Wire is behind nascent projects to build a film studio on the Tanzanian islands of Zanzibar as well as one in the Ghanaian capital, Accra.Born in London, Elba, whose mother is from Ghana and father from Sierra Leone, has a strong attachment to Africa.He wants to leverage his star power to back its burgeoning film business as he says it is vital that Africans get to tell their own stories.\n\"I would certainly consider settling down here; not even consider, it’s going to happen,\" he said in an interview on the sidelines of an industry meeting in Accra.\"I think [I’ll move] in the next five, 10 years, God willing. I’m here to bolster the film industry - that is a 10-year process - I won’t be able to do that from overseas. I need to be in-country, on the continent.\"But in the spirit of Pan-Africanism he will not commit to living in a specific place.\"I’m going to live in Accra, I’m going to live in Freetown [Sierra Leone’s capital], I’m going to live in Zanzibar. I’m going to try and go where they’re telling stories - that’s really important.\"One goal he does have is to make a film in his studio in Accra one day.\nElba, who played South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela in the 2013 biopic Long Walk to Freedom, believes that it is vital for Africans to be centre-stage in the entire film-making process. That is in front of the camera, behind the camera and also in financing, distribution, marketing and showing the final product.He imagines that just as movie audiences around the world know the differences between the US cities of New York and Los Angeles without necessarily ever having visited them, they will one day have a more nuanced understanding of the continent.\n\"This sector is a soft power, not just across Ghana but across Africa.\"If you watch any film or anything that has got to do with Africa, all you’re going to see is trauma, how we were slaves, how we were colonised, how it’s just war and when you come to Africa, you will realise that it’s not true.\"So, it’s really important that we own those stories of our tradition, of our culture, of our languages, of the differences between one language and another. The world doesn’t know that.\"With Nigeria’s Nollywood producing hundreds of movies a year, films are arguably one of the country’s most successful exports. There is also a tradition, especially in parts of Francophone Africa, of making high-quality films.Elba has previously recognised the talent in Africa's film industry, but said the facilities were \"lacking\".A 2022 report from Unesco backed up the actor.The UN's cultural agency said that despite \"significant growth in production\", the business of film-making across the continent was hindered by issues such as piracy, insubstantial training opportunities and a lack of official film institutions.Elba believes with the right momentum and involvement of governments willing to create an enabling environment, a virtuous circle can be established.\"We have to invest in our story-telling because when you see me, you see a little version of yourself and that encourages us.\"\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica"}

Di'Anno later admitted he had been partying \"non-stop, 24 hours a day\" and that the impact of his lifestyle \"wasn’t fair to the band, the fans or to myself\".The band's current members paid tribute, saying they were \"all deeply saddened\" by his death.\nIn a statement on social media, bass player Steve Harris said it was \"just so sad he's gone\".\"At least he was still gigging until recently, it was something that kept him going, to be out there whenever he could.

Di'Anno auditioned and got the job.Their sound was an anomaly during the ascendancy of punk rock, and they struggled to get gigs outside London. To address the issue, they decided to make a demo tape to drum up business.Known as the Soundhouse Tapes, the three-track demo gained them a cult following, selling 5,000 copies by mail order. By 1979, they had secured a record deal with EMI and started recording their self-titled debut.Although it was put together in a hurry, the record was hugely influential - with its combination of punk intensity and rock riffs setting the template for heavy metal in the 1980s.It entered the UK album chart at number four in April 1980, and the success of the single Running Free earned the band a coveted spot of music TV show Top of the Pops.The follow-up album, 1981's Killers, had a harder sound again. But after a world tour, Di'Anno was either kicked out of the band or left of his own accord.Either way, he said success had led him to a dark place.\"I was already a fairly excessive character, but there I really went for it,\" he told Rock Hard magazine in 2004. \"I was on another planet, as well as the rest of the band.\"With Dickinson taking over, Iron Maiden went on to become one of rock's most successful groups, with genre-defining hits like Run To The Hills and Can I Play With Madness.But Di'Anno never held a grudge against the band, or his replacement.\"Everyone thinks that we hated each other, which is [completely wrong],\" he told SDTV in an interview last month. \"That's the press for you.\"He also denied rumours that he had been underpaid for his contribution to the first two Iron Maiden albums, which included co-writing credits on key tracks like Remember Tomorrow, Killers, Sanctuary and Running Free.\"To be honest with you, it's nobody's damn business [but] I got paid very well,\" he told Rock Hard in 2022. \"They looked after me.

In 2022, fans helped him raise money to have major knee surgery in Croatia.  Despite that, he kept up a robust touring schedule, playing more than 100 shows in 2023 and 2024.A career retrospective album, The Book of the Beast, was released last month, including highlights from his solo career and two \"reworked\" versions of Iron Maiden songs Tomorrow and Wrathchild.A documentary about his life is scheduled for release at the end of the year."}

{"doc_id": 0, "question": "Which city does Massimo Bottura claim as the birthplace of tortellini?", "answer": ["Castelfranco Emilia"], "doc": "For centuries, residents of Emilia-Romagna have disagreed about which of its two main cities invented tortellini, but the truth may be neither did.\nI'm seated at the three-Michelin starred Osteria Francescana, and can't believe my luck. It's been eight years since I first attempted to snag a reservation at the coveted restaurant in Modena, Italy, helmed by Massimo Bottura, one of the world's most influential chefs. I've been to Italy nearly 50 times since 2016, and each visit, I prowl the restaurant's website, even setting alarms at odd hours, to no avail.\nBut one week ago, from my hotel in Tuscany, I saw a 12:30 lunch cancellation and pounced. And now I'm finally here, in a world of chic Gucci wallpaper and dim lighting, about to try the famous 15-course tasting menu for myself.\nI'm savouring \"Tortellini or Dumplings?\" – a Korean spin on tortellini in brodo (tortellini soup) where Osteria Francescana serves twisted dumplings in seaweed stock instead of traditional capon broth – when Bottura himself walks in. The desire to eat at one of the world's best restaurants is what initially piqued my interest in this place, but what brought me here tonight is the delicious bite on my spoon: tortellini.\nTortellini – a circular-shaped pasta, twisted around a filling of mortadella, prosciutto, pork loin and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese – are the quintessential pasta varietal here in Italy's hilly Emilia-Romagna region. But while there is no question that tortellini hails from Emilia-Romagna, scholars, chefs and locals have bickered for centuries about which of the region's two rival medieval powerhouses can lay claim to the honour: Modena or Bologna?\nI am sure Bottura knows; he's not only from Modena, but is also famed for his innovative tortellini dishes, inspired by childhood memories of sitting under his grandmother's table as she prepared the meaty morsels. As he stops to greet me, I asked him where tortellini were invented: Modena or Bologna?\n\"Neither,\" he says, his arms sprawling as wide as his smile. \"It's Castelfranco Emilia.\"\nHis answer stops me mid-bite. Castelfranco Emilia is a small town located between Modena and Bologna. It is indeed famous for its sfogline (pasta makers), but this was the first I'd heard of its connection to tortellini. I left Osteria Francescana with more questions than answers.\nThe \"Modena-versus-Bologna\" tortellini debate had intrigued me ever since visiting the Palazzo Comunale di Modena; home to the Stolen Bucket. This was where I first learned that Modena and Bologna's feud goes back to the Middle Ages when the cities were entwined in a bitter religious rivalry that lasted more than 300 years (Modena supported the Holy Roman Empire; Bologna supported the Popes). In 1325, during one of the war's skirmishes, Modenese soldiers stole a bucket from a city well in Bologna; a war trophy.\nWhat follows next is delicious myth: in 1622, Modenese poet Alessandro Tassoni wrote La Secchia Rapita (The Stolen Bucket), a parody of the events where the Olympic gods descend to aid in the fight; Apollo and Minerva sided with Bologna, while Mars, Venus and Bacchus sided with Modena.\nThen, in the late 19th Century, Italian poet Giuseppe Ceri nodded to Tassoni and the medieval-era Modena-Bologna-bucket conflict in his own poem, The Bellybutton of Venus, writing that after the gods came down to intervene, they took a detour to Castelfranco Emilia. The fateful side trip results in tortellini.\nThere are a few variations of the myth, but the most popular version goes like this: Venus, Bacchus and Mars walk into an inn in Castelfranco Emilia. The following morning, Venus is sleeping naked and alone, and the innkeeper, infatuated with her beauty, peeps through the keyhole and sees her exposed belly button. Inspired by its shape, he creates tortellini.\nWhat's unclear is whether there is any historical truth that led Ceri to set this scene in Castelfranco Emilia. Centuries earlier, sometime between 1688 and 1690, the priest and historian Ludovico Antonio Muratori wrote that he ate minestra di tortellini (tortellini soup) in Castelfranco Emilia. It may be impossible to prove that tortellini were in fact native to that city (or that Ceri had ever read the account), but today in Castelfranco Emilia, there is a statue of the innkeeper peeping through the keyhole to see Venus' belly button.\nHungrier than ever for the truth after my encounter with Bottura, I reached out to a series of local chefs to get to the bottom of the matter and found that many people today – even the region of Emilia-Romagna's website – embrace Castelfranco Emilia's role as the mythical birthplace of tortellini.\n\"The idea of [tortellini] was born in a small village, Castelfranco Emilia, in between Bologna and Modena,\" said chef Aurora Mazzucchelli of Casa Mazzucchelli, a Michelin-star restaurant in Sasso Marconi, a province of Bologna, when I asked her where tortellini were invented.\n\"The debate has been settled,\" said chef Ottavio Gnazzo, the chef de cuisine at Rezdôra, a New York restaurant serving Emilia-Romagnan cuisine helmed by Bottura mentee chef Stefano Secchi. \"We know tortellini comes from Castelfranco Emilia.\" \nHowever, despite the general consensus that Castelfranco Emilia is the beloved pasta's birthplace, there is still some speculation.\n\"We are sure that tortellini come from Bologna,\" said Monica Venturi of Bologna's Le Sfogline. Venturi grew up in Bologna, where her family has been running the small handmade pasta shop since 1996.  \"When tortellini were made for the first time, Castelfranco Emilia was under Bologna.\"\nSecchi himself doesn't necessarily disagree but adds context. \"The issue is that tortellini were first made in Castelfranco Emilia. [We know of] the legend of Venus's bellybutton, but Castelfranco Emilia has been a province of both Modena and Bologna, so [it] will be tough to ultimately decide.\"\nIts exact geographical origins aren't the only dispute surrounding this stuffed pasta. In Bologna, tortellini are often much smaller than tortellini from Modena and Castelfranco Emilia; called tortellini al mignolo (pinky finger tortellini). And, \"In Bologna, we normally use raw filling, while in Modena, they normally use cooked [browned in butter] filling,\" added Mazzucchelli. \"I personally like raw stuffing because it allows me to work with a more solid texture.\"\nBack in Modena, Francesco Vincenzi is head chef of Franceschetta58, a casual bistro opened by Bottura that serves bold, modern Modenese cuisine, so Vincenzi has a different take on the recipe.\n\"Our tortellini filling is not quite blanched, not quite cooked, but in between,\" he said.\nTraditionally, tortellini are served in brodo (broth) or panna (heavy cream) but restaurants like Francescetta58 are serving them in a decadent Parmigiano cream instead; a shock to tortellini purists.\n\"I don't like when they try to change the recipe of this type of tradition,\" Venturi said. \"Tortellini must be cooked in the broth, boiled and then eaten with the broth.\"\nFillings, cities and regional variations aside, there is one factor that Emilia-Romagnans generally agree on: making tortellini is a family affair. The task is largely attributed to the rezdôra, or the \"head of the household\", in Modenese dialect, which refers to the women who roll out pasta by hand.\nGnazzo, who was born in the US but raised in Italy, grew up in the kitchen watching his father; also a chef. He reflected on watching rezdôre in Bologna for the first time.\n\"They're masters at making pasta, so when I went to Bologna and saw them making tortellini, I bought some, and we made it there; the right way in capon stock,\" he said.\nMazzucchelli has fond early memories of tortellini, too. \"I used to make tortellini with my mom and dad. It was a significant moment around the table to help pinch shut the tortellini.\"\nTortellini are Emilia-Romagnan culture at its core, commonly enjoyed in celebration around Christmas time and the Feast of Saint Stephen (Boxing Day). The circular-shaped pasta is so tied to the region that La San Nicola Association hosts an annual Tortellini Festival (Sagra del Tortellino) in Castelfranco Emilia during the second week of September. The festival lasts one week, with each night featuring a tortellini dish from a restaurant in the region. On the final night, there's a live performance that reenacts the innkeeper peeping through the keyhole.   \nAs evidenced by his \"Tortellini or Dumplings?\" and \"Tortellini Walking on Broth\" dishes, Bottura has no qualms about reinventing the beloved pasta. But to ensure that tortellini tradition isn't lost, Bottura and his wife and business partner Lara Gilmore opened Tortellante, a cooking school in Modena where elderly women teach young adults with autism how to make tortellini.\nSo, which city invented tortellini – Bologna, Modena or Castelfranco Emilia? The world may never know for sure, but one thing is certain: tortellini is one of the most defining foods of the Emilia-Romagna region.\nAs Bottura enthusiastically told me, \"Even if you don't believe in God, you can believe in tortellini.\"\nRecipe for tortellini\nby Chef Ottavio Gnazzo on behalf of Rezdôra\nMethod\nStep 1\nIn a tabletop mixer, add the flour and make a well. In a small bowl, mix the eggs with the olive oil, then add the mixture to the mixer. Mix the dough on low speed for 10 minutes, pat into a flat disc or ball and wrap with plastic wrap. Leave at room temperature until ready to roll out.\nStep 2\nAdd all the meats to a grinder on fine die setting and grind together. Transfer the meat mixture to a small bowl, then mix in the nutmeg, sea salt, Parmigiano and eggs to create a paste.\nStep 3\nRoll out the dough into a sheet to the last setting on the machine; it must be thin enough to slightly see the wooden board or hand underneath. Cut 1.5-2in squares in the dough with a wheel cutter with straight edges. Place a dot of filling in the centre of each square. Fold each square into a triangle by putting pressure on the edges to properly seal the triangle. Then, grab the two edges of the triangle, wrap it around the tip of your pinky and pinch it so it closes.\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n--- \nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday."}
{"doc_id": 1, "question": "What is the length of the Alps to Ocean bike trail?", "answer": ["315km"], "doc": "The country's longest continuous bike trail – the Alps to Ocean – takes travellers on a 315km journey into the seismic-shifting saga of Zealandia, Earth's \"lost\" continent.\nA young and restless country in Earth's development story, New Zealand lies along an exceptionally fractious crack in the planet's crust. Tectonically speaking, the landmass has been through a lot of upheaval in the (relatively short) 83 million years since it split from the Gondwana supercontinent to be on its own plate.  And now I am with my husband and two friends on New Zealand's longest continuous bike trail – the Alps to Ocean (A2O) – that will take us through the heart of this seismic-shifting saga.\n\"What you're passing through on the Alps to Ocean trail is the story of Zealandia, the eighth continent of the world,\" says geoscientist Sasha Morriss.\nAfter Zealandia departed Gondwana for Pacific isolation, it sank then erupted, giving rise to the Southern Alps extending across much of the nation's South Island and some of New Zealand's most remarkable landscapes. Its fossil-rich seabed also surfaced, revealing microscopic to megafauna skeletons that tell scientists about a disappeared sea and the severe weather patterns that followed to shape the country as we know it. A twist in the plot is that 94% of Zealandia remained \"lost\" underwater, hidden in plain sight, until satellite technology advanced and researchers officially mapped it 2017. \"New Zealand is just the very top,\" Morriss says.\nThe epic 315km A2O, one of the country's 23 Ngā Haerenga Great Rides, starts in the foothills of the country's highest peak, Aoraki/Mount Cook (3,724m). From here, it meanders through the Southern Alps' broad, glacier-carved valleys into Waitaki Whitestone Geopark, established in 2023, which Morriss describes as a \"vanished world\" where dolphins with shark-like teeth once swam in a warm shallow sea. The trail finishes at Ōamaru, a town literally built from the ancient seabed we'll ride on.\nIn parts, the A2O is so remote that at night the Milky Way can be seen in some of the clearest night skies in the world. However, isolation shouldn’t put anyone off: several companies offer guided trips, which include luggage transfers to prebooked accommodation (farmsteads, lake lodges and boutique B&Bs). A support vehicle tags along. But the good news is, with the number of e-bikes now available, it's unlikely riders will need it.\nUp until recently, the full A2O would only be tackled by very fit cyclists. However, e-bike supply chains have finally caught up from the surge in popularity during the pandemic and local adventure companies have invested in new fleets. The result is that the mainly smooth and predominantly undulating Alps 2 Ocean has opened up to a significantly wider demographic.\nAs adept cyclists with limited time, we've opted for regular mountain bikes on a customisable five-day self-guided trip. The raw newness of New Zealand hits us on our first easy 7km roll down a gravelly path to the Tasman Valley, where our ride is wonderfully interrupted by alpine headwaters that we need to cross by helicopter. Earth's forces only heaved up the Southern Alps – one of the world's fastest-growing and eroding ranges – within the last five million years. Streams of scree slide down near-vertical slopes. The sheer volume forces glacial meltwater into striking braids of milky blue and bright grey that fan out across the vast valley floor, which will eventually become the mighty 200km Waitaki River.\nWhile the icy knife edges of Aoraki/Mount Cook glare from above, a five-minute flight – with our mountain bikes swinging precariously in a cage underneath – gives us a bird's eye view of the sparkling phenomena. Deposited deeper into isolation, we jump back on our bikes and ride a colossal, vibrant, flat grassy plain to Lake Pūkaki. At 178sq km, it's the largest in a chain of brilliant turquoise glacial lakes to come. The juvenile spine of the Southern Alps keeps us company until we reach our cosy motel in the subalpine town of Twizel to wrap up our first (77km) day.\nThe next morning, we enter the 7,200 sq km Whitestone Waitaki Geopark – Australasia's only Unesco Global Geopark – where we spend a good chunk of the day exploring its squiggly foreshore, popping in and out of sheltered bays where we skim stones – perhaps a microfossil or two – across serene waters. It's easy to imagine the killer dolphins that lurked long before glaciers shunted, sculpting its ragged mountain surrounds. These pre-human shores were also a penguin paradise. According to studies of fossilised bones found in the geopark, a giant, 154kg penguin (Kumimanu fordycei) once shuffled around here, three times heavier than today's largest species, the emperor penguin.  \nThe following day is as tough as the A2O gets, with a steady 300m climb over a generous 5km through a shady forest to the journey's 900m highpoint at Tarnbrae. I'm several hundred years too late to spot a now-extinct Haast's eagle, but I can imagine this giant bird – the largest eagle to ever have existed, with a 3m wingspan and feet and claws as big as a modern day tiger's – gliding over the infinite prairie-like Mackenzie Basin.

{"doc_id": 2, "question": "Who is the tin whistle maestro that leads The Crane Bar's Sunday 13:00 session?", "answer": ["Sean Ryan"], "doc": "Galway native Enda Scahill shares his favorite haunts for trad music, from packed sessions at Tig Cóilí in the Latin Quarter to intimate clambake sets at Tigh Ned on Inisheer.\nGalway, with its narrow medieval streets, vibrant pub culture and unique brand of craic (lively fun), also boasts one of Ireland's best music scenes. Set in a Gaeltacht, (Irish-speaking district) the city is especially enjoying a resurgence of traditional Irish music – known locally as \"trad\", a name that gives the genre a hipster cool, far from its humble origins as tunes played in kitchens and street corners.\nWe asked Galway native Enda Scahill, one of Ireland's foremost banjo players, to help us find his hometown's best trad music sessions. At just 11 years old, Scahill was performing at pubs packed with tourists eager to experience Ireland's traditional music. \"At the time, there was definitely the perception of Irish music as shamrocks, leprechauns and 'Danny Boy'. But, just like jazz and bluegrass, there are layers upon layers of depth,\" says Scahill. \"Galway is a very small town, but you can catch two sessions a day, every day of the week… Young people proudly play old-time music, and so the quality of musicians at the moment is exceptional. We say, 'If you drop a coin out of a plane over Ireland, you'll no doubt hit a world-class fiddle player'. And banjo players too.\"\nWhen Scahill was a teen, there was one banjo player in the west of Ireland, \"and we'd drive an hour and a half, which was a big deal in rural Ireland in the '80s, what with the bad cars and bad roads\". Now, Irish banjo players are everywhere in the trad music scene, and he's taught a fair share of them.\n\"Everybody wants to come to Galway!\" he says. \"We have a fantastic reputation for fun, food and the amazing scenery of Connemara at our doorstep.\" And all are invited, listener or player. \"The sessions are very welcoming. There's no gatekeeper.\"\nHere are Scahill's favourite places to catch trad music in Galway.\n\"Tig Cóilí is probably the most famous pub in Galway,\" says Scahill. Despite its prime spot at the car-free crossroads of Mainguard and Shop Streets, this cosy pub has a country tavern feel.\nUS dollar bills, police badges and framed photos of famous faces – Paul Brady, Sharon Shannon, Dessie O'Halloran, Frankie Gavin and Máirtín O'Connor – cover the walls, giving the pub a well-worn, lived-in charm. \"It looks 100 years old, but I remember, before it became Tig Cóilí, it was a modern-style pub, mostly quiet except for, as people would say, 'swingers at two o'clock in the afternoon,' says Scahill.\nMusicians squeeze into a corner booth by the fire-engine-red windows for two daily sessions. Each session features three core players, with seven or eight others joining in. \"I played their very first session 25 years ago, with the owner's son,\" says Scahill. \"The only real change they've made since then is putting up barriers to stop tourists from falling onto the musicians.\"\nWebsite: www.tigchoiligalway.comAddress: Mainguard St, GalwayPhone: +353 91 561 294Instagram: @tigchoili\nHead out of Tig Cóilí and across the street to Taaffes, the historic stone-fronted pub that's anchored Galway's pub scene for more than 150 years. Owned by the Lally family, Taaffes was a second home to Scahill as a boy.\n\"I was playing there so much in my late teens that my mother would call the bar looking for me,\" he recalls. \"Their Guinness is fantastic, and it's always packed, morning, noon and night.\" Inside, low ceilings and cosy nooks invite lingering.\nSessions happen in a snug at the front; a stage in the back is pulled out for bigger performances. Music fills the pub twice daily; Sharon Shannon and Seán Keane have lit up the room, along with local musicians and wandering minstrels.\nOn St Patrick's Day, most pubs in Ireland lock their doors by 13:00, shifting to a one-in, one-out policy. \"Taaffes is always the first to do that because of the crowds,\" says Scahill. \"One year I played there, and it was like a war zone – people falling on stage, instruments getting kicked. You walk out feeling like you've survived Vietnam.\"\nWebsite: https://taaffesbar.ie/Address: 19 Shop Street, GalwayPhone: +353 91 564066Instagram: @taaffesbar\nFor more than 40 years, tin whistle maestro Sean Ryan, with his sharp staccato style, has led The Crane Bar's Sunday 13:00 session. \"He really looks the part, too,\" says Scahill. \"The gigantic beard, the bonnet hat. He lives in the famously haunted Leap Castle, and his biggest tune is The Coast of Austria – a nice example of Irish sardonic humour.\"\nHoused inside a Victorian cottage on Sea Road, The Crane is all character – rough floors, bright green and yellow walls and dusty framed photos of its storied history. The Guinness, with its creamy head, even backs up the pub's claim as Galway's best.\nThe pub's musical heritage runs deep. Owner Mike Crehan, a tin whistle player, is related to the legendary fiddler Junior Crehan. More sessions happen nightly at 18:00, when seasoned players and newcomers mix in a laid-back, homey atmosphere. The upstairs \"Listeners Club\" feels more like a concert venue, with bands and singer-songwriters starting at 21:00.\nWebsite: www.thecranebar.comAddress: 2 Sea Road, GalwayPhone: +353 91 587419Instagram: @thecranebar\nFrom The Crane, walk towards the River Corrib for a few minutes to find Monroe's Tavern, where Scahill has been playing since he was 15. A Galway institution since 1964, \"it's been in the Monroe family for decades and is now run by Gary Monroe, who's hugely passionate about Irish music, especially trad,\" he says.\nTrad sessions happen nightly, but the standout is Fridays at 16:30. What began a couple of years ago as a casual meet-up has since become one of the best sessions in the city, where a rotating guest joins two core musicians. \"I'll be the third every six weeks or so,\" says Scahill. \"Plus the drop-in musicians; some days, there might be 20. It's always loads of fun.\" At 19:00, Monroe's brother, who runs the tavern's pizza parlour, hands out slices to the players at the session's end.\n\"Gary's built a strong, welcoming community vibe,\" says Scahill. \"There's a guy who owns the biggest garden centre in Galway who comes every week with his double bass. His sister Mary, in her 70s, has an incredible voice. She always sits at the bar, and at some point, someone will say, 'Oh Mary, sing us a song'.' And the whole place goes quiet. It's magic.\"\nWebsite: www.monroes.ieAddress: 14 Dominick Street Upper, GalwayPhone: +353 91 583397Instagram: @monroestaverngalway\nOne of Galway's best features is how quickly the stunning countryside unfolds just outside its perimeter. Follow the Lough Corrib north for about 32km to the village of Cloughanover. \"On a very dark road in the middle of nowhere is Campbell's Tavern,\" Scahill says, \"a proper country pub, a true hidden gem.\"\nCampbell's hosts a trad session every Wednesday and a Thursday old-time bluegrass session at 22:00 that can run until 02:00. \"It's quite a big pub, and the sessions happen in the front bar, where if 50 people were in it, you couldn't turn around,\" says Scahill. \"Willie Campbell, the owner, is a very community-led guy, a big music head as well.\"\nScahill once brought Jake Workman, guitarist for Ricky Skaggs' band Kentucky Thunder, to the old-time session, where a cohort of musicians gathers in the middle and at any moment, someone from the group – or from a far corner – starts a new tune. Everyone joins in, creating a spontaneous, collaborative experience. \"Jake is one of the best guitar players in the world and he said he'd never experienced anything like it. It's an incredible, quintessential Irish experience.\"\nWebsite: www.campbellstavern.netAddress: Cloughanover, Headford, Co. Galway, H91 T4A8Phone: +353 93 35454\nDrive south from Galway along the Wild Atlantic Way for about 27km and you'll reach Kinvara, a seaside village where colourful houses line the waterfront. On the corner of Main Street and The Quay is Connolly's, a pub known for its rousing Thursday and Sunday sessions.\n\"Many world-class musicians and singers have moved out of Galway City to Kinvara, escaping traffic and high rents,\" Scahill explains, \"though of course, both followed. It's also become a real hub where Galway people meet [County] Clare people… I've only played there a handful of times, but it's a really lovely spot. They've recently added glass doors that open to an ocean view, and you hear some amazing musicians.\"\nUpstairs, the restaurant serves locally sourced dishes from Kinvara's organic farmers and foragers, adding a touch of refinement to the laid-back vibe of the sessions taking place below. Just beyond the county line is the otherworldly karst landscape of the Burren and the legendary Cliffs of Moher.\nWebsite: www.upstairsatconnollys.ieAddress: The Quay, Kinvara, Co. Galway H91 D623Phone: +353 91 637530Instagram: @connollyskinvara\n\"If you're here in the summer, you have to visit Inisheer, one of the three Aran Islands [in Galway Bay],\" says Scahill. \"First, there's the biggest, Inishmore – 'inish' means island, and 'more' means big. Then you've got Inishmaan, the middle one – 'maan' means average. Finally, there's Inisheer, since 'sheer' means small.\"\n\"They really put a lot of thought into those names,\" he deadpans.\nOn Inisheer, find Tigh Ned tucked inside a thatched cottage that's been in the Ó Conghaile family since 1897. From April to October, musicians fill the salty air with the sounds of sweet trad. \"It's as 'country pub' as you want on an island.\"\nThe kitchen serves classic pub fare and fresh seafood. Scahill recommends calling ahead to order the crab special. \"Every morning their boats come back filled with these big brown Atlantic crabs. They boil them in the back and serve them with brown bread and butter. It's the most spectacular meal you'll ever have. My son and his friend had it when they were about nine, and years later, they're still talking about it.\"\nWebsite: www.tighned.com Address: Inisheer, Aran Islands, Co.

But, just like jazz and bluegrass, there are layers upon layers of depth,\" says Scahill. \"Galway is a very small town, but you can catch two sessions a day, every day of the week… Young people proudly play old-time music, and so the quality of musicians at the moment is exceptional. We say, 'If you drop a coin out of a plane over Ireland, you'll no doubt hit a world-class fiddle player'. And banjo players too.\"\nWhen Scahill was a teen, there was one banjo player in the west of Ireland, \"and we'd drive an hour and a half, which was a big deal in rural Ireland in the '80s, what with the bad cars and bad roads\". Now, Irish banjo players are everywhere in the trad music scene, and he's taught a fair share of them.\n\"Everybody wants to come to Galway!\" he says. \"We have a fantastic reputation for fun, food and the amazing scenery of Connemara at our doorstep.\" And all are invited, listener or player. \"The sessions are very welcoming. There's no gatekeeper.\"\nHere are Scahill's favourite places to catch trad music in Galway.\n\"Tig Cóilí is probably the most famous pub in Galway,\" says Scahill. Despite its prime spot at the car-free crossroads of Mainguard and Shop Streets, this cosy pub has a country tavern feel.\nUS dollar bills, police badges and framed photos of famous faces – Paul Brady, Sharon Shannon, Dessie O'Halloran, Frankie Gavin and Máirtín O'Connor – cover the walls, giving the pub a well-worn, lived-in charm. \"It looks 100 years old, but I remember, before it became Tig Cóilí, it was a modern-style pub, mostly quiet except for, as people would say, 'swingers at two o'clock in the afternoon,' says Scahill.\nMusicians squeeze into a corner booth by the fire-engine-red windows for two daily sessions. Each session features three core players, with seven or eight others joining in. \"I played their very first session 25 years ago, with the owner's son,\" says Scahill. \"The only real change they've made since then is putting up barriers to stop tourists from falling onto the musicians.\"\nWebsite: www.tigchoiligalway.comAddress: Mainguard St, GalwayPhone: +353 91 561 294Instagram: @tigchoili\nHead out of Tig Cóilí and across the street to Taaffes, the historic stone-fronted pub that's anchored Galway's pub scene for more than 150 years. Owned by the Lally family, Taaffes was a second home to Scahill as a boy.\n\"I was playing there so much in my late teens that my mother would call the bar looking for me,\" he recalls. \"Their Guinness is fantastic, and it's always packed, morning, noon and night.\" Inside, low ceilings and cosy nooks invite lingering.\nSessions happen in a snug at the front; a stage in the back is pulled out for bigger performances. Music fills the pub twice daily; Sharon Shannon and Seán Keane have lit up the room, along with local musicians and wandering minstrels.\nOn St Patrick's Day, most pubs in Ireland lock their doors by 13:00, shifting to a one-in, one-out policy. \"Taaffes is always the first to do that because of the crowds,\" says Scahill. \"One year I played there, and it was like a war zone – people falling on stage, instruments getting kicked. You walk out feeling like you've survived Vietnam.\"\nWebsite: https://taaffesbar.ie/Address: 19 Shop Street, GalwayPhone: +353 91 564066Instagram: @taaffesbar\nFor more than 40 years, tin whistle maestro Sean Ryan, with his sharp staccato style, has led The Crane Bar's Sunday 13:00 session. \"He really looks the part, too,\" says Scahill. \"The gigantic beard, the bonnet hat. He lives in the famously haunted Leap Castle, and his biggest tune is The Coast of Austria – a nice example of Irish sardonic humour.\"\nHoused inside a Victorian cottage on Sea Road, The Crane is all character – rough floors, bright green and yellow walls and dusty framed photos of its storied history. The Guinness, with its creamy head, even backs up the pub's claim as Galway's best.\nThe pub's musical heritage runs deep. Owner Mike Crehan, a tin whistle player, is related to the legendary fiddler Junior Crehan. More sessions happen nightly at 18:00, when seasoned players and newcomers mix in a laid-back, homey atmosphere. The upstairs \"Listeners Club\" feels more like a concert venue, with bands and singer-songwriters starting at 21:00.\nWebsite: www.thecranebar.comAddress: 2 Sea Road, GalwayPhone: +353 91 587419Instagram: @thecranebar\nFrom The Crane, walk towards the River Corrib for a few minutes to find Monroe's Tavern, where Scahill has been playing since he was 15. A Galway institution since 1964, \"it's been in the Monroe family for decades and is now run by Gary Monroe, who's hugely passionate about Irish music, especially trad,\" he says.\nTrad sessions happen nightly, but the standout is Fridays at 16:30. What began a couple of years ago as a casual meet-up has since become one of the best sessions in the city, where a rotating guest joins two core musicians. \"I'll be the third every six weeks or so,\" says Scahill. \"Plus the drop-in musicians; some days, there might be 20. It's always loads of fun.\" At 19:00, Monroe's brother, who runs the tavern's pizza parlour, hands out slices to the players at the session's end.\n\"Gary's built a strong, welcoming community vibe,\" says Scahill. \"There's a guy who owns the biggest garden centre in Galway who comes every week with his double bass. His sister Mary, in her 70s, has an incredible voice. She always sits at the bar, and at some point, someone will say, 'Oh Mary, sing us a song'.' And the whole place goes quiet. It's magic.\"\nWebsite: www.monroes.ieAddress: 14 Dominick Street Upper, GalwayPhone: +353 91 583397Instagram: @monroestaverngalway\nOne of Galway's best features is how quickly the stunning countryside unfolds just outside its perimeter. Follow the Lough Corrib north for about 32km to the village of Cloughanover. \"On a very dark road in the middle of nowhere is Campbell's Tavern,\" Scahill says, \"a proper country pub, a true hidden gem.\"\nCampbell's hosts a trad session every Wednesday and a Thursday old-time bluegrass session at 22:00 that can run until 02:00. \"It's quite a big pub, and the sessions happen in the front bar, where if 50 people were in it, you couldn't turn around,\" says Scahill. \"Willie Campbell, the owner, is a very community-led guy, a big music head as well.\"\nScahill once brought Jake Workman, guitarist for Ricky Skaggs' band Kentucky Thunder, to the old-time session, where a cohort of musicians gathers in the middle and at any moment, someone from the group – or from a far corner – starts a new tune. Everyone joins in, creating a spontaneous, collaborative experience. \"Jake is one of the best guitar players in the world and he said he'd never experienced anything like it. It's an incredible, quintessential Irish experience.\"\nWebsite: www.campbellstavern.netAddress: Cloughanover, Headford, Co. Galway, H91 T4A8Phone: +353 93 35454\nDrive south from Galway along the Wild Atlantic Way for about 27km and you'll reach Kinvara, a seaside village where colourful houses line the waterfront. On the corner of Main Street and The Quay is Connolly's, a pub known for its rousing Thursday and Sunday sessions.\n\"Many world-class musicians and singers have moved out of Galway City to Kinvara, escaping traffic and high rents,\" Scahill explains, \"though of course, both followed. It's also become a real hub where Galway people meet [County] Clare people… I've only played there a handful of times, but it's a really lovely spot. They've recently added glass doors that open to an ocean view, and you hear some amazing musicians.\"\nUpstairs, the restaurant serves locally sourced dishes from Kinvara's organic farmers and foragers, adding a touch of refinement to the laid-back vibe of the sessions taking place below. Just beyond the county line is the otherworldly karst landscape of the Burren and the legendary Cliffs of Moher.\nWebsite: www.upstairsatconnollys.ieAddress: The Quay, Kinvara, Co. Galway H91 D623Phone: +353 91 637530Instagram: @connollyskinvara\n\"If you're here in the summer, you have to visit Inisheer, one of the three Aran Islands [in Galway Bay],\" says Scahill. \"First, there's the biggest, Inishmore – 'inish' means island, and 'more' means big. Then you've got Inishmaan, the middle one – 'maan' means average. Finally, there's Inisheer, since 'sheer' means small.\"\n\"They really put a lot of thought into those names,\" he deadpans.\nOn Inisheer, find Tigh Ned tucked inside a thatched cottage that's been in the Ó Conghaile family since 1897. From April to October, musicians fill the salty air with the sounds of sweet trad. \"It's as 'country pub' as you want on an island.\"\nThe kitchen serves classic pub fare and fresh seafood. Scahill recommends calling ahead to order the crab special. \"Every morning their boats come back filled with these big brown Atlantic crabs. They boil them in the back and serve them with brown bread and butter. It's the most spectacular meal you'll ever have. My son and his friend had it when they were about nine, and years later, they're still talking about it.\"\nWebsite: www.tighned.com Address: Inisheer, Aran Islands, Co.

In many ways, the nation is still grappling with this dark time and the lingering effects on both its landscape and people.

Renowned for its delicious street food markets, vibrant cities, unique mix of French colonial architecture and stunning natural landscapes from lush jungles to jagged peaks, the nation is currently experiencing a surge of foreign visitors and is on pace for a record-breaking year.\nIn the most recent episode of BBC's The Travel Show, Vietnamese American host William Lee Adams travels across the country on an emotional journey to reconnect with his mother's country of origin and to lay his brother's ashes in the bustling metropolis of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) where his family has a crypt.\nIn many ways, Saigon was the epicentre of the Vietnam War in 1960s and '70s, as it served as the headquarters for US military operations in the region. However, the city's history stretches back at least 300 years before this conflict, and its past is reflected in the ornate temples and pagodas, vibrant night markets and mix of Asian and European influences found in this nine-million person metropolis.\nAs in much of Vietnam, food is a major draw for travellers to Ho Chi Minh City. Street food dishes like bot chien (pan-fried rice flour cakes served with papaya, shallots and green onions) found at places like the historic Bến Thành Market are popular, as are more upscale restaurants such as the Michelin-starred Akuna. \"The market, and food in general is kind of like the heart of Vietnamese culture,\" tour guide and content creator Lylla told the Travel Show. \"Food is that important.\"\nMore like this:• Saving Vietnam's endangered langur monkeys• The controversial art festival deep in the jungle• The mystical instrument that speaks with the spirits\nBeyond the markets, Ho Chi Minh City is a blend of Vietnamese, French and international influences.

First built in 1899, the train, which travels more than 1,700km from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi on a single track, was bombed several times during the Vietnam War to cut off the important connections between the communist north and US-controlled south of the country. Today, the ride is a great way to get a view of some of the country's most beautiful landscapes, as it passes by the breathtakingly blue waters of Nha Trang's beaches, and through the jungles of the Annamite Mountain range. The train also makes stops at several popular tourist towns, such as Da Nang and Hoi An, before reaching its final destination, the historic capital city of Hanoi.\nOnce the capital city of the communist north, Hanoi was founded in 1009 AD as the imperial city for the Ly Dynasty. Beginning in 1873, the city served as the capital of the French-controlled colony and remains Vietnam's capital today.

The site offers guided tours spanning nearly 1,300 years of Vietnam's past.  \nIn addition to being the legislative capital of Vietnam, Hanoi is also considered the nation's cultural capital and it's home to a thriving arts and education scene.

{"doc_id": 6, "question": "What year did Gabriel Luna first attend the United States Grand Prix?", "answer": ["2016"], "doc": "Since attending the 2016 US Grand Prix, Austin's own Gabriel Luna is a huge F1 fan. Ahead of the 2024 race, the actor shares his Bat City picks, from live music to breakfast tacos.\nAustin, Texas, is known for its barbecue, cowboy culture, breakfast tacos, rollicking music scene and its defiant slogan: \"Keep Austin Weird.\"\nBut since 2012, when the Circuit of The Americas in Travis County, located 15 miles south-east of the city, hosted its inaugural United States Grand Prix, Austin has also been considered the American home for Formula One.\nActor Gabriel Luna fell in love with the sport when he was invited to the 2016 United States Grand Prix. \"Just the speed, the sounds, meeting all of the drivers. It was really exciting,\" says Luna.\nAfter striking up a friendship with the Haas F1 team, Luna has since attended races in Budapest, Monza and Montreal. He's also returned to his home city of Austin, where he was born, raised and attended university, to watch the United States Grand Prix live on three more occasions.\n\"I just fell in love with the sport. I've seen it grow exponentially year after year,\" says Luna, who credits the Netflix documentary series Drive to Survive for bringing more US attention to the sport. While Miami and Las Vegas now host their own races, Luna believes that Austin's distinctive free-wheeling spirit and party atmosphere make it the best place to watch Formula One in the US.\n\"Having the race in Austin is a great way to show off the city,\" he says. \"It's a truly beautiful part of the country. But also the city is built on music, food and enjoying life. We attract a lot of bon vivants who just want to live a good life and they can get that in Austin.\"\nHere are Luna's favourite ways to experience his hometown.\nLocated within Austin's bustling Zilker Metropolitan Park is the scenic Barton Springs Pool, where for just a small fee, visitors can relax on the grass and jump into its water all year-round. For Luna, this three-acre pool fed by underground springs is the \"centre of culture and life\" in Austin. \"You get to see Austin's youth, its old-timers, its hippies doing their yoga, people playing guitar. Everyone is just jumping into the water, which is perpetually 68 degrees.\"\nWhen Luna is home in the summer months, he loves relaxing by the water, jumping in, drying off and jumping back in – on repeat. \"You can just lay out on the hill on the far side of Barton Springs and see the whole city. It's the heart of the town.\"\nWebsite: https://www.austintexas.gov/department/barton-springs-poolAddress: 2131 William Barton Dr., Austin, TX 78746Phone number: (512) 974-6300Instagram: @austincityparks\nWhile Austin is renowned for its food, booze and music scenes, it also has a bevy of fantastic museums. Luna's favourite is the Emma S Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center, located in Rainey Street Historic District right by Lady Bird Lake. \"It's in this beautiful building, which itself is a work of art,\" says Luna, whose parents were both of Mexican descent. \"But it also has a theatre, a gallery and their rotating exhibits celebrate Mexican American arts and heritage.\"\nLuna also points visitors to The Blanton Museum of Art at the Austin chapter of the University of Texas, which has more than 21,000 works of modern and contemporary art from Europe, the United States and Latin America. It's also home to renowned American artist Ellsworth Kelly's immersive art building Austin; famed for its natural depiction of light and colour.\nWebsite: https://www.austintexas.gov/department/emma-s-barrientos-mexican-american-cultural-centerAddress: 600 River St, Austin, TX 78701Phone number: (512) 974-3772Instagram: @esbmacc\nAustin, which bills itself as the \"live music capital of the world\", has a wildly diverse music scene rivalling those of Nashville, Memphis and even New Orleans. \"Culturally in Austin, it's all about the music. You just have to get out there, catch a band and listen to the music,\" says Luna.\nThe actor and sometimes musician loves Broken Spoke, an old-school spot that's been serving beer and chicken-fried steak and hosting bands since 1964. \"It's protected by the National Registry and is an incredible little honky-tonk bar that can't be touched,\" says Luna. \"The community gathered together to acquire enough signatures to stop it from being purchased.\"\nAnother venue Luna calls his \"personal headquarters\" is Antone's; one of Austin’s most iconic blues venues. Antone's, now found on Fifth Street, might have moved locations a few times since the original location opened in 1975, but that hasn't stopped the likes of Ray Charles, James Brown, Willie Nelson and Stevie Ray Vaughan from playing its stages. \"It's really home for me when I'm back in Austin.\"\nFor even more live music, Luna also suggests The Continental Club and the juke joint C-Boy's Heart & Soul, both found on Congress Street; one of downtown Austin's premier shopping and entertainment districts.\nWebsite: https://www.brokenspokeaustintx.net/Address: 3201 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704Phone number: (512) 442-6189Instagram: @brokenspokeaustintx\nLuna can't help but get nostalgic when asked about breakfast tacos; a Tex-Mex dish of scrambled eggs, cheeses, veg and meat wrapped in a tortilla that's become known as an Austin specialty. He laments a number of places which have closed, in particular Maria's Taco Express on South Lamar Boulevard, which shut its doors in September 2020. Luna also insists that the best breakfast tacos in Austin are at his grandmother's house, which he ate every morning for 12 years before school.\nRather than badgering her for them, Luna heads to Juan in A Million in East Austin. \"It's a great Mexican restaurant that has fantastic breakfast tacos,\" he says. Juan in a Million's menu features a full array of breakfast taco choices, from chorizo (sausage) to migas-style (with soft scrambled eggs and crispy fried tortilla strips). If you're in the north of the city, Luna suggests Tierra Linda Taqueria, a wonderful no-frills eatery located in a gas station serving huge orders.\nWebsite: https://juaninamillion.com/Address: 2300 E Cesar Chavez St, Austin, TX 78702Phone number: (512) 472-3872Instagram: @juaninamillionrestaurant\nThe great state of Texas is barbecue country, and Austin takes the craft very seriously. For great central Texas-style barbecue, Luna says visitors can never go wrong at Austin cult favourite Franklin Barbecue; a turquoise-and-white roadside stop on 11th Street instantly recognisable by its massive queue. Founded in 2009 by Aaron Franklin, the spot was named the best barbecue in the country by Bon Appétit in 2011. \"Aaron is a legend who has created an incredible legacy for himself,\" says Luna. \"I've lived in Los Angeles since 2011 and I always get his [barbecued beef] brisket shipped out for my Super Bowl parties.\"\nLuna also recommends Black's Barbecue, founded in 1932 and located in Lockhart; a 30-minute drive from Austin. But he quickly adds that Terry Black's BBQ is also worth a visit; explaining that the two restaurants have been engulfed in a family rivalry since the latter was opened by twin brothers Mike and Mark when they didn't approve of their Uncle Kent's cooking techniques at Black's. \"They're both great,\" says Luna. \"The brisket in particular at Black's is fantastic.\"\nUltimately, Luna says, \"There's lots of great barbecue across Austin. At a certain point it's a little but like splitting hairs because so much of it tastes so good.\"\nWebsite: https://franklinbbq.com/Address: 900 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78702Phone number: (512) 653-1187Instagram: @franklinbbq\nAs Austin continues to become one of the most desirable cities in America, Luna notes that its food-scene has improved dramatically.\nHis favourite burgers in Austin are found at the Casino El Camino and Sandy's Hamburgers, while he hits the Taqueria Arandas chain for Mexican food, the posh Uchi for elevated sushi, Justine's for a hip French brasserie experience, the generational Hoover's Cooking on Manor Road for farm-to-table soul food and East Side Pies for thin crust pizza.\nOne Austin dish that Luna thinks is underrated is a good bowl of queso; a creamy dip made of melted cheese. \"People do it in a really artful way,\" he says. \"Then you just get some tortilla chips and dip them in there. It's like a fondue.\" Luna calls Magnolia Café – a vintage Tex Mex-influenced diner on Congress Street – the best place to eat queso in Austin, as they mix in avocado, beef, salsa, pico de gallo, black beans and jalapeño to create their own signature take on the dish. \"It's the perfect thing to eat after a long night of drinking and when you're really drunk,\" he says.\nWebsite: https://www.magnoliacafeaustin.com/Address: 1920 South Congress Ave, Austin TX 78704Phone number: (512) 445-0000Instagram: @magnoliacafeaustin\nAustin's Sixth Street is renowned for its long stretch of bars, which Luna says you can stumble between with ease: \"They all have different personalities.

{"doc_id": 7, "question": "What is the elevation of Kamikochi?", "answer": ["1,500m"], "doc": "With a record 35 million foreign visitors expected in Japan this year, Kamikochi is an idyllic, relaxing break from some of the country's more heavily touristed destinations.\nNestled in the Japanese Alps at 1,500m elevation, the seasonal resort town of Kamikochi is an idyllic, car-free getaway with cool, crisp mountain air, riverside hiking trails and an abundance of Japanese snow monkeys. There are no private homes, year-round residents or chain stores of any kind – no McDonald’s, Starbucks or Burger King; instead, it's known as an escape from the enervating heat that grips most of Japan in the summertime and for its abundant, sublime autumn colours that peak in October. I loved it immediately, though my teenage sons, Leo and James baulked at the communal shower arrangement in our hotel.\nTheir mood brightened, though, as I explained that our agenda for our three-day, two-night stay included nothing but hiking, eating and relaxing. \"No museums, no temples?\" James gleefully asked. We'd arrived in Kamikochi roughly mid-way through a month-long trip around Honshu, Japan’s largest island, and by this point the boys had seen far too many temples, shrines and museums for their tastes. Kamikochi, we reassured them, would be a holiday from our holiday in a simple place with a few clusters of hotels, restaurants and shops all clustered along the Azusa River.\nThe quest to find pristine natural environs unspoiled by mass tourism long predates the social media era. In his 1896 book, Mountaineering and Exploration in the Japanese Alps, the English missionary, climber and conservationist Reverend Walter Weston echoed the sentiments of an unnamed Japanese writer who complained of \"foreign tourists who come to his country, and after rushing through it at the rate of 40 miles an hour then hurry home to record their impressions and pose as authorities on what they have only glanced at\".\nIn his writings and lectures, Weston popularised the term \"Japanese Alps\" and put the area that became the resort town of Kamikochi on the radar of international tourists. The town's popularity as a holiday destination for Japanese tourists spiked in 1927 with the release of Kappa, a novel set in Kamikochi written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, one of Japan's most famous writers. In 1934, Chūbu-Sangaku National Park, home to Kamikochi and 10 of Japan’s 21 peaks over 3,000m, was established and the area became known as the \"most beautiful valley in Japan\", inspiring comparisons with California's Yosemite National Park.\nWith all the media hype about overtourism and rising visitor numbers in Japan, I hoped Kamikochi would be a relaxing break from some of the more heavily touristed destinations like Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo, which we’d visited, and enjoyed, earlier in the trip.  \nIn the nearby gateway city of Kanazawa, I asked our volunteer guide, Michiko Kitaguchi, whom we found through the excellent Kanazawa Goodwill Guide association, about Kamikochi, and she said that in Chinese, Kamikochi fittingly means \"a place where the god descends\". Her favourite time of year in Kamikochi is autumn when the colours in the valley are spectacular. \n\"I am a Kamikochi lover who goes there every year to feel the energy of nature,\" she said. \"The sounds of the river flowing, the autumn-coloured mountains of the Hodaka, the golden Japanese larch forest by the river is really stunning in the fall.\"\nKamikochi has been a green getaway since 1975 when private cars and motorcycles were banned in response to rising traffic and visitor numbers and a desire to preserve the place’s tranquillity. In fact, conservation efforts began a century earlier, in 1875, when the former logging town banned felling trees in the area to preserve its natural beauty. Laws were passed to prevent the removal of alpine plants in 1909, and it was the first area in the country to be formally designated as a \"protection forest\" in 1916. In 1963, officials established the Kamikochi Beautification Association to address the issue of littering and poor tourist etiquette more broadly. In the ‘70s, the number of hotels and inns was capped at 17, the same number that exist today (along with a pair of campsites; there are no Airbnbs).\nThe place has an egalitarian appeal in that almost everyone arrives by bus – if you try to drive, you have to park about half an hour away and take a bus anyway; and the only other option is to hike in or take a taxi, though few visitors opt to do this. A hybrid bus route to Kamikochi was established in 1994, leaving from Takayama, our prior stop, and also Matsumoto, famous for its striking 16th-Century castle, and tour buses were banned in 2005.\nAs we exited the bus terminal with our baggage, I was glad that we'd chosen a nearby hotel: the Nishi-itoya Mountain Lodge, which has private rooms and hostel-style bunk rooms. Other options, like the historic Tokusawa Inn, founded in 1885, require a one- to two-hour hike from the bus terminal with your luggage.\nWe walked across the Kappa bridge, named after Akutagawa's novel, and immediately slalomed through a mob of selfie stick-toting tourists. I reckoned that Kamikochi wasn't as off-the-beaten path as we'd hoped, though it was noon on a Saturday, which is rarely an ideal time to have a place all to yourself.\nWe drew up a plan to take three easy hikes, one for each day of our visit, and avoid all the steep knee-shattering treks up Mt Jonen, Mt Chogatake, Mt Oku-Hotakadake and others. (The national park has 40 mountain peaks with altitudes of more than 2,400m.) On our first hike to Myojin Pond, I felt the wish-I-could-bottle-it travel high I live for as a compulsive traveller as we met one troop of mischievous Japanese snow monkeys after another while hiking along and near the river. It was a balmy 18C and the crisp mountain air was a welcome relief from the steamy streets of Takayama. Kamikochi is a major birding destination, and we could hear what a birder told me were Japanese bush warblers singing what sounded like, \"hoo-ke-kyo\". \nKamikochi drew 1.3 million visitors, mostly Japanese, in 2023. Most years, 100 million or more visit Mt Fuji, which, along with Kamikochi, is the only other destination designated by Japan's Cultural Affairs Agency as both a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and a Special Natural Monument. We were also pleased to discover that many of Kamikochi's visitors are day-trippers who disappear by late afternoon. After the initial crush of tourists we'd seen at the Kappa bridge on our first afternoon, Kamikochi didn't seem overly touristy or spoiled.  \n\"Where do you live?\" I asked one of the friendly restaurant servers at our hotel. \"In a dormitory for workers right back there,\" she replied, pointing behind the hotel's annex.  She explained that Kamikochi is only open to visitors from 27 April to 15 November because it’s too cold in winter to attract guests. On those dates, elaborate opening and closing ceremonies take place, presided over by Shinto priests who give thanks to nature as revellers indulge in cups of hot sake. There's also a popular boat festival in October, but in the offseason, it's a ghost town and workers like our server migrate elsewhere.\nMore like this:• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024• Why you should visit Japan's small but mighty 'little Kyoto'• The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world \nI asked if she enjoys living in such a transient place, and the young woman pulled out her phone to answer my question. \"Last week, I went on a long hike and took these,\" she said, swiping through some striking photos of Taisho Pond, a large body of water flanked by volcanic, snow-capped Mt Yakedake, which erupted in 1915, effectively damming the Azusa River and creating this picturesque pond. \"This is why I'm happy here.\"\nTaisho Pond, the end point of our final hike, was indeed stunning. The craggy mountains with their serpentine dustings of snow looked like something out of a fantasy world created by Akutagawa, the writer who took his own life at age 35 shortly after the publication of Kappa. In the novel, the protagonist visits Kamikochi in search of tranquillity, but finds the place inhabited by a strange race of 1m-tall, sumo-loving water spirits he called kappas.\nWe encountered nothing so strange, though my sons strongly objected to the nudity in the onsen (natural hot springs). But we found that Japan's conservation efforts to preserve the wild beauty of Kamikochi that seduced Weston, Akutagawa and others have largely succeeded. Indeed, there aren't many places left where you can enjoy a car-free holiday in a place where you're guaranteed to hear birdsong rather than car horns and see snow monkeys but no McDonalds.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

In his 1896 book, Mountaineering and Exploration in the Japanese Alps, the English missionary, climber and conservationist Reverend Walter Weston echoed the sentiments of an unnamed Japanese writer who complained of \"foreign tourists who come to his country, and after rushing through it at the rate of 40 miles an hour then hurry home to record their impressions and pose as authorities on what they have only glanced at\".\nIn his writings and lectures, Weston popularised the term \"Japanese Alps\" and put the area that became the resort town of Kamikochi on the radar of international tourists. The town's popularity as a holiday destination for Japanese tourists spiked in 1927 with the release of Kappa, a novel set in Kamikochi written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, one of Japan's most famous writers. In 1934, Chūbu-Sangaku National Park, home to Kamikochi and 10 of Japan’s 21 peaks over 3,000m, was established and the area became known as the \"most beautiful valley in Japan\", inspiring comparisons with California's Yosemite National Park.\nWith all the media hype about overtourism and rising visitor numbers in Japan, I hoped Kamikochi would be a relaxing break from some of the more heavily touristed destinations like Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo, which we’d visited, and enjoyed, earlier in the trip.  \nIn the nearby gateway city of Kanazawa, I asked our volunteer guide, Michiko Kitaguchi, whom we found through the excellent Kanazawa Goodwill Guide association, about Kamikochi, and she said that in Chinese, Kamikochi fittingly means \"a place where the god descends\". Her favourite time of year in Kamikochi is autumn when the colours in the valley are spectacular. \n\"I am a Kamikochi lover who goes there every year to feel the energy of nature,\" she said. \"The sounds of the river flowing, the autumn-coloured mountains of the Hodaka, the golden Japanese larch forest by the river is really stunning in the fall.\"\nKamikochi has been a green getaway since 1975 when private cars and motorcycles were banned in response to rising traffic and visitor numbers and a desire to preserve the place’s tranquillity. In fact, conservation efforts began a century earlier, in 1875, when the former logging town banned felling trees in the area to preserve its natural beauty. Laws were passed to prevent the removal of alpine plants in 1909, and it was the first area in the country to be formally designated as a \"protection forest\" in 1916. In 1963, officials established the Kamikochi Beautification Association to address the issue of littering and poor tourist etiquette more broadly. In the ‘70s, the number of hotels and inns was capped at 17, the same number that exist today (along with a pair of campsites; there are no Airbnbs).\nThe place has an egalitarian appeal in that almost everyone arrives by bus – if you try to drive, you have to park about half an hour away and take a bus anyway; and the only other option is to hike in or take a taxi, though few visitors opt to do this. A hybrid bus route to Kamikochi was established in 1994, leaving from Takayama, our prior stop, and also Matsumoto, famous for its striking 16th-Century castle, and tour buses were banned in 2005.\nAs we exited the bus terminal with our baggage, I was glad that we'd chosen a nearby hotel: the Nishi-itoya Mountain Lodge, which has private rooms and hostel-style bunk rooms. Other options, like the historic Tokusawa Inn, founded in 1885, require a one- to two-hour hike from the bus terminal with your luggage.\nWe walked across the Kappa bridge, named after Akutagawa's novel, and immediately slalomed through a mob of selfie stick-toting tourists. I reckoned that Kamikochi wasn't as off-the-beaten path as we'd hoped, though it was noon on a Saturday, which is rarely an ideal time to have a place all to yourself.\nWe drew up a plan to take three easy hikes, one for each day of our visit, and avoid all the steep knee-shattering treks up Mt Jonen, Mt Chogatake, Mt Oku-Hotakadake and others. (The national park has 40 mountain peaks with altitudes of more than 2,400m.) On our first hike to Myojin Pond, I felt the wish-I-could-bottle-it travel high I live for as a compulsive traveller as we met one troop of mischievous Japanese snow monkeys after another while hiking along and near the river. It was a balmy 18C and the crisp mountain air was a welcome relief from the steamy streets of Takayama. Kamikochi is a major birding destination, and we could hear what a birder told me were Japanese bush warblers singing what sounded like, \"hoo-ke-kyo\". \nKamikochi drew 1.3 million visitors, mostly Japanese, in 2023. Most years, 100 million or more visit Mt Fuji, which, along with Kamikochi, is the only other destination designated by Japan's Cultural Affairs Agency as both a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and a Special Natural Monument. We were also pleased to discover that many of Kamikochi's visitors are day-trippers who disappear by late afternoon. After the initial crush of tourists we'd seen at the Kappa bridge on our first afternoon, Kamikochi didn't seem overly touristy or spoiled.  \n\"Where do you live?\" I asked one of the friendly restaurant servers at our hotel. \"In a dormitory for workers right back there,\" she replied, pointing behind the hotel's annex.  She explained that Kamikochi is only open to visitors from 27 April to 15 November because it’s too cold in winter to attract guests. On those dates, elaborate opening and closing ceremonies take place, presided over by Shinto priests who give thanks to nature as revellers indulge in cups of hot sake.

There are no private homes, year-round residents or chain stores of any kind – no McDonald’s, Starbucks or Burger King; instead, it's known as an escape from the enervating heat that grips most of Japan in the summertime and for its abundant, sublime autumn colours that peak in October.

The soundtrack was whispering wind, singing birds and rushing water as a river tumbled down the valley.\n\"Look around, we have mountains and glaciers and are far from everyday life. This is a challenge, but also our blessing.\" \nHard-to-reach hotels and huts are a Swiss specialty, with many preserved as monuments to Alpine history. The Jungfrau Region, within the snow-ruffled reaches of the Bernese Alps, is for lofty shelters in the car-free villages of Mürren, Wengen and Kleine Scheidegg, where accommodation can only be accessed by ski lift, cable car or cogwheel train. These are places of meditation, where hikers wander and the mind slows.\nThen there is an alphabet of striking refuges hidden in mountain eyries, from the Appenzell Alps to Zermatt. Great St Bernard Hospice in Valais is a remarkable example, requiring a continual push by snowshoe in winter, or a high-altitude access road, which only opens to traffic after the thaw.\nBut Alp Grüm, straddling a razor-edge ridge on the south side of the Bernina Pass at 2,091m, pushes such extremes to the limits. It is caught between languages, with the immediate north speaking Romansh and the valley below Italian. There is no road to it beneath Piz Bernina, the highest peak of the Eastern Alps. And the only way to get there year-round is to hike in for hours – not recommended in winter – or take the Rhaetian Railway that climbs high between the little towns of Pontresina and Poschiavo near the Italian border.\nWhat's more, the hotel's identity is wholly drawn from the history of the rail company, and it doubles as train station, platform and waiting room. Between 20:00 and 08:00, however, the trains leave the rails and the hotel is cut off from the rest of Switzerland, left to exist in a bubble of its own. \nVisiting the Alps can so often feel like stepping into a storybook, and that feeling is particularly strong in the Engadin valley, where the horizon is a lithograph of great mountains that crest like waves. I've been to the area many times – to measure my experience of Switzerland at its wildest against that of the pioneers of winter sports tourism – but this time I was in comfort, on board the Bernina Express and travelling south from Chur, the oldest town in Switzerland.\nThe story of Alp Grüm started in 1906 with Bernina-Bahngesellschaft, a visionary rail company that unveiled an ambitious plan for an electrified train connecting Switzerland with Italy beneath a roll and tumble of mountains and glaciers. What made the idea so extraordinary was that it would become the Alps' highest rail crossing, prising open the area for tourists but also slashing travel time for traders; back then, it took horse-riding messengers nine hours to complete the dangerous journey between Samedan and Tirano. The struggle was intensified in winter due to avalanche risk and the possibility of becoming stranded by heavy snowfall.\nTo say Switzerland did not have precedent for this sort of engineering project would be to engage in understatement. Thirty years prior in 1888, Dutch hotelier Willem Jan Holsboer founded the nearby Landquart-Davos narrow-gauge railway.

{"doc_id": 8, "question": "In what year did the Bernina Line open?", "answer": ["1910"], "doc": "While Switzerland is full of Alpine huts and hard-to-reach hotels, Alp Grüm is a mountain anomaly like no other.\n\"Happily, there are no roads. There is only nature. Sunrises. Sunsets. Stillness. Nothing more, \" Primo Semadeni, the 57-year-old manager of Alp Grüm hotel in Graubünden, told me as we stood overlooking a high-altitude pass covered in perpetual snow. The soundtrack was whispering wind, singing birds and rushing water as a river tumbled down the valley.\n\"Look around, we have mountains and glaciers and are far from everyday life. This is a challenge, but also our blessing.\" \nHard-to-reach hotels and huts are a Swiss specialty, with many preserved as monuments to Alpine history. The Jungfrau Region, within the snow-ruffled reaches of the Bernese Alps, is for lofty shelters in the car-free villages of Mürren, Wengen and Kleine Scheidegg, where accommodation can only be accessed by ski lift, cable car or cogwheel train. These are places of meditation, where hikers wander and the mind slows.\nThen there is an alphabet of striking refuges hidden in mountain eyries, from the Appenzell Alps to Zermatt. Great St Bernard Hospice in Valais is a remarkable example, requiring a continual push by snowshoe in winter, or a high-altitude access road, which only opens to traffic after the thaw.\nBut Alp Grüm, straddling a razor-edge ridge on the south side of the Bernina Pass at 2,091m, pushes such extremes to the limits. It is caught between languages, with the immediate north speaking Romansh and the valley below Italian. There is no road to it beneath Piz Bernina, the highest peak of the Eastern Alps. And the only way to get there year-round is to hike in for hours – not recommended in winter – or take the Rhaetian Railway that climbs high between the little towns of Pontresina and Poschiavo near the Italian border.\nWhat's more, the hotel's identity is wholly drawn from the history of the rail company, and it doubles as train station, platform and waiting room. Between 20:00 and 08:00, however, the trains leave the rails and the hotel is cut off from the rest of Switzerland, left to exist in a bubble of its own. \nVisiting the Alps can so often feel like stepping into a storybook, and that feeling is particularly strong in the Engadin valley, where the horizon is a lithograph of great mountains that crest like waves. I've been to the area many times – to measure my experience of Switzerland at its wildest against that of the pioneers of winter sports tourism – but this time I was in comfort, on board the Bernina Express and travelling south from Chur, the oldest town in Switzerland.\nThe story of Alp Grüm started in 1906 with Bernina-Bahngesellschaft, a visionary rail company that unveiled an ambitious plan for an electrified train connecting Switzerland with Italy beneath a roll and tumble of mountains and glaciers. What made the idea so extraordinary was that it would become the Alps' highest rail crossing, prising open the area for tourists but also slashing travel time for traders; back then, it took horse-riding messengers nine hours to complete the dangerous journey between Samedan and Tirano. The struggle was intensified in winter due to avalanche risk and the possibility of becoming stranded by heavy snowfall.\nTo say Switzerland did not have precedent for this sort of engineering project would be to engage in understatement. Thirty years prior in 1888, Dutch hotelier Willem Jan Holsboer founded the nearby Landquart-Davos narrow-gauge railway. The town of Davos is best known for the World Economic Forum, but its roots are as a spa town, and Holsboer capitalised by way of bringing more visitors to the resort than the horse-drawn carriages did. No less of a marvel before that was the opening of the Gotthard Railway from Immensee to Chiasso in 1882, featuring what was then the world's longest rail tunnel.\nIt was against this background, on a sunny day in July 1910, that the Bernina Line was opened and Alp Grüm began life – not as a stone-built, 10-room hotel and waiting room as it is today, but as a timber cabin, from where the station chief could check the line every morning. \nThe Rhaetian Railway took control of the Bernina Line in 1943, and the idea, as company spokesperson Camille Härdi describes it, was simply \"a rest stop\" – a notion that is hard to believe today.\n\"The Bernina Line wasn't even originally supposed to operate all year round,\" Härdi said. \"However, the railway's management board decided in 1910 – once the line to Tirano had been finished – to acquire a snow plough. It first came into use in the winter of 1910/11 and proved to be a wondrous piece of technology, capable of cutting the considerable costs normally associated with snow-clearing.\"\nThese days, the Bernina Line rarely, if ever, closes, meaning Alp Grüm is no longer the Shangri-La it once was. \"Winter has changed over the years with the glaciers receding and global warming,\" said Härdi. \"Even so, it still happens there is plenty of snow. There's a locomotive called a 'Snow Blower' that makes sure the train runs even after a heavy snowfall.\"\nImagine the excitement of trainspotters today: the Unesco World Heritage-listed Bernina Line is home to the world's only self-propelled, steam-powered snow plough locomotive.\n \nBut plenty of the original impulse to build Alp Grüm survives. The geometry of the glaciers and lakes remains impeccably beautiful, and when I arrived, I was immediately transfixed by the Palü Glacier and the blue-green Lago Palü at its terminus.\nAbove was Ospizio Bernina, the Alps' highest rail crossing at 2,253m. Far below, looking down towards Valposchiavo, the serpentine curve of the tracks switch-backed down a steeply pitched slope. Foregrounding that, the station, remodelled in stone in 1923, was gloriously isolated. It had the air of an Italian villa transferred to a mountaintop, with pizzoccheri (flat short buckwheat noodles) the specialty of its platform restaurant. \nMore like this:• Europe's stunning high-tech luxury train• A new night train connecting some of Europe's great cities• The Train d'Artouste: Europe's highest narrow-gauge train\nThe hardest part about living at Alp Grüm, according to Semadeni, who has spent 18 years here, is the unpredictability each day brings. And to put it mildly, it was one of those days. \"This morning, one of my waitresses quit,\" said Semadeni, sighing. \"She jumped on the train and left for anywhere but here. Understand, this is not only a job. It's a lifestyle being up here.\"\nThere are also problems with the line's supply chain. Everything served in the restaurant for 10 months a year (the hotel closes in November and for one month after Easter) arrives by train, and the sublime location doesn't always compensate for things not arriving on time. Appropriately, while we chatted, Semadeni was awaiting a delivery of prosciutto crudo.\nThese are mountains that are full of peril – avalanches, landslides, glacial crevasses, thunderstorms and rockfalls. Clearly, running out of Italian ham is one of the more manageable hardships.\n\"Of course, but I can't go anywhere else to get it,\" smiled Semadeni, his mood brightening. \"And if I forget to order bread, we don't have any either. Some winter days, that's OK as we have no guests. But when the sun shines, 60 or more people can show up.\"\nSemadeni's other complaint – perhaps most annoying of all – is the days when the line is closed, of which he has experienced many. Happily, the service has only been interrupted once this year. No mountain monk, Semadeni likes the rhythm of new arrivals.\nAlp Grüm is, without doubt, an unsung Swiss landmark – and there is splendour everywhere. An Alpine garden of lady's mantle, edelweiss, lemon balm and peppermint blooms in summer. In winter, the high ground seems to close in at night, in collusion with the stars. And when the last train leaves for the day, there is an almost unattainable silence.\nI was glad I'd visited. It'd been a trip into a part of Switzerland so few see. There is only nature, Semadeni had said. Stillness and nothing more.\nIt was very easy to see what he meant.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}
{"doc_id": 9, "question": "What is the real name of the celebrity known as Swizz Beatz?", "answer": ["Kasseem Daoud Dean"], "doc": "Long closed to the outside world, this ancient city is now revealing its secrets. From hot air ballooning to stargazing, here are Swizz Beatz's picks in one of his favourite places.\nThroughout his 25-year career, the celebrity – whose real name is Kasseem Daoud Dean – has worn many hats: entertainer, DJ, producer, art buyer, fashion designer and husband to fellow musician Alicia Keys.\nAnd in 2020, the Bronx-born Dean made history as the first American owner of a Saudi Arabian camel racing team.\nThe move may have surprised fans, but anyone close to Dean knows about his decades-long love for Saudi Arabia – a passion inherited from his grandfather, who completed the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in 1978. The Grammy winner himself is a practicing Muslim and visits the kingdom regularly.\n\"It was nowhere near as developed as it is today,\" he says, recalling his first visit in 2006. \"But you can feel the energy. You can feel the culture, you can feel the craft.\"\nDean has travelled all over the nation; lately, most often to the ancient city of AlUla – a dramatic desert valley oasis in north-western Saudi Arabia's Hijaz region that has, until recently, been closed to visitors. Despite being the site of the Unesco-listed Hegra, the secondary hub of the region's ancient Nabataean civilisation, it wasn't until 2019 that the Saudi government began issuing tourist visas for non-religious travel, finally allowing travellers to experience the splendour of AlUla's 900-year-old Old Town and its otherworldly sandstone and granite mountain landscapes, as part of a $1tn Saudi government initiative to revamp tourism throughout the nation.\nDean has been there every step of the way.\n\"My relationship with AlUla is like seeing a seed planted in the ground and watching a beautiful flower grow,\" says Dean, who was among the first invited to watch the construction of the city's massive Maraya performance venue – a mirror-clad behemoth rising out of the desert sands – and eco-friendly luxury accommodation resorts like Our Habitas. \"Seeing the vision coming to life in front of my eyes has been magical to watch.\"\nDean has \"lost count\" of his visits, but \"every month is something new. It's amazing to see a place thriving off of innovation, arts, creativity and music\".\nAlong with Keys, Dean has worked tirelessly to improve AlUla's cultural scene; helming and DJing at AlUla on Wheels, an immersive open-air skating rink in the AlJadidah Arts District and cheering on his camel racing team, Saudi Bronx, at the yearly AlUla Cup. \"[My] camel racing team is a homage to the desert,\" he explains. \"People [here] know me for camel racing more than my music.\"\nHere are Dean's favourite ways to experience AlUla.\nIn reintroducing itself to the world, AlUla's art galleries now attract international talent and its yearly Wellness Festival features a five-day immersive \"sanctuary\" retreat and celebrity-led wellness experiences like yoga and sound baths. But to get a real feel for the city, \"I would go to the Old Town out the gate,\" declares Dean. \"It gives you the history of AlUla. It's quite a unique area because they're actually rebuilding the entire Old Town.\n \nAlUla's Old Town – a dazzling honeycomb of low-roofed mudbrick buildings – dates to the 12th Century CE, when it was a key settlement on the pilgrimage between Damascus and Mecca. The site, crowned by a 45m-high fortress and hemmed in by 14 gates, was largely abandoned in the 20th Century. Today boutiques, art galleries and cafes have taken over its ancient dwellings.\n\"When you go there you can see how they build the mud houses, from back in the days until how it's gonna be in the future. You get to see the future of it and still go have a Michelin-star dinner right next door,\" says Dean. \"They're keeping the structures old but with new materials and then, you know, in one of those structures you'll see, like, a Bergdorf.\" He adds, \"It's pretty modern in that sense… It's not like 'damn, I got to take a camel to the store.'\"\nAlUla, nestled in the vast AlUla Valley, is surrounded by a seemingly endless expanse of swirling red sand dotted by russet-coloured mountains, sand dunes and wadis. At night, its skies are famously pitch black.\n\"When you go outside at night it's like you can touch the stars from your porch,\" says Dean. \"It almost feels like you're on Mars because the rocks are so big, and you're surrounded by so much gentle strength.\"\nFor Dean, \"the entire desert experience\" – arranged by his go-to luxury resort Our Habitas – makes a great cultural introduction to AlUla. \"You're in the tent and you have the Saudi coffee and you have the bread and the food and the herbs and the fire's burning,\" he says. \"Usually, they'll have an oud player. It's amazing. You can sleep out there or just make a dinner reservation. They put on a whole show, fire dancing and dancing to the Arabic music and showing you how to cook local dishes.\"\nAlong with desert glamping and dining experiences offered by Our Habitas and Banyan Tree AlUla, wild camping is also possible in AlUla; there are two free authorised camping sites, as well as 10 large-scale campsites including Pangaea Adventure Club. Dressing in layers is recommended, as is safe, responsible camping behaviour, like maintaining a clean campsite and leaving the desert vegetation and wildlife untouched. \n\"I've never seen the constellations so clear as in AlUla,\" says Dean. \"When I'm in AlUla I can hear myself think. It's an amazing place to go rejuvenate, an amazing place to try new things.\"\nWebsite: https://www.ourhabitas.com/caravan-alula/\nWith so many new visitors arriving each month, AlUla's food scene now brims with international eateries ranging from sushi bars to hamburger joints. But \"of the local foods, [I highly recommend] a kabsa\", says Dean – citing a traditional Arabian dish of spiced rice and meat, often chicken, camel, fish or lamb. \"It takes a little while to cook but when you get it, it's worth every bite. They cook the lamb very well to where the meat is very [tender]. And they mix it with this rice and it all comes in this pot. You can share with multiple people. The rice has all these herbs and different things in it. Some have different mixes, some are more spicy than others. So tasting multiple kabsas… you're never going to lose with that.\"\nWhen asked to pick a favourite restaurant in town, Dean is hard-pressed. \"You could pick any restaurant. You could pick any hotel. The food is outrageous,\" he says. \"You can tell the people have the passion. I love when a place is so unique that everybody has pride in with it. It's not so rushed. The love is there. The craft is there. What I love about Alula is that the craft is there.\"\nWith its stunning mountains and unique rock formations like Elephant Rock, AlUla has a lot to offer outdoor adventurers. But Dean has special love for the AlUla Skies Festival, a spectacular 10-day autumn event celebrating the city's magnificent skies, from stargazing to Dean's favourite, hot air balloon rides.\n\"That is unbelievable,\" he says. \"I'm not a big fan of hot air balloons. But when I went in AlUla it was just something different. They didn't go too high; I'm a little scared of heights. Ours was at a pretty amazing level where you can go over the Old Town and go over the beautiful landscapes. Seeing where the oasis meets the desert is pretty unique.\"\nDuring the festival, up to 60 hot air balloons lazily circle the sky in both tethered and untethered flights, taking in the sweeping views of Hegra, the Old Town and the endless expanses of desert sand. Participants can also charter helicopter rides, and for those who'd rather stay closer to the ground, there are meditation sessions and cooking classes under the stars.\n5. Best place to learn about the past: Hegra \n\"Hegra is a must, must, must,\" says Dean.\nThere are more than 27,000 archaeological sites in AlUla dating to the late prehistoric period (5200-1200 BCE), but Hegra, also known as Mada'in Saleh, is the most well-known. Inhabited since the 1st Century BCE – and a thriving incense and trading hub until the 12th Century – Hegra is the site of a 1.6-hectare necropolis complex containing 111 boulder-cut monumental decorated and inscribed tombs, beautifully preserved by the arid desert conditions. It was named a Unesco World Heritage site in 2008; Saudi Arabia's first World Heritage property.\n\"You see the structure and the condition and the masterpiece, the masterful architects that built these things way, way, way, way back,\" says Dean. \"It's magical to see.\"\nWhile in Hegra, visitors can opt for an organised bus tour to the ancient city of Dadan and Jabal Ikmah, a 9th-Century BCE \"open-air library\" containing the world's largest concentration of Lihyanite and Dadanitic rock inscriptions, or set off on the Oasis Heritage Trail; a 3km palm-tree shaded walking tour through the AlUla Oasis.\n\"You just have to go to AlUla, period!\" says Dean.\nWebsite: https://www.experiencealula.com/en/plan-your-trip/alula-visitor-centres\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

At night, its skies are famously pitch black.\n\"When you go outside at night it's like you can touch the stars from your porch,\" says Dean. \"It almost feels like you're on Mars because the rocks are so big, and you're surrounded by so much gentle strength.\"\nFor Dean, \"the entire desert experience\" – arranged by his go-to luxury resort Our Habitas – makes a great cultural introduction to AlUla. \"You're in the tent and you have the Saudi coffee and you have the bread and the food and the herbs and the fire's burning,\" he says. \"Usually, they'll have an oud player. It's amazing. You can sleep out there or just make a dinner reservation. They put on a whole show, fire dancing and dancing to the Arabic music and showing you how to cook local dishes.\"\nAlong with desert glamping and dining experiences offered by Our Habitas and Banyan Tree AlUla, wild camping is also possible in AlUla; there are two free authorised camping sites, as well as 10 large-scale campsites including Pangaea Adventure Club. Dressing in layers is recommended, as is safe, responsible camping behaviour, like maintaining a clean campsite and leaving the desert vegetation and wildlife untouched. \n\"I've never seen the constellations so clear as in AlUla,\" says Dean. \"When I'm in AlUla I can hear myself think. It's an amazing place to go rejuvenate, an amazing place to try new things.\"\nWebsite: https://www.ourhabitas.com/caravan-alula/\nWith so many new visitors arriving each month, AlUla's food scene now brims with international eateries ranging from sushi bars to hamburger joints. But \"of the local foods, [I highly recommend] a kabsa\", says Dean – citing a traditional Arabian dish of spiced rice and meat, often chicken, camel, fish or lamb. \"It takes a little while to cook but when you get it, it's worth every bite. They cook the lamb very well to where the meat is very [tender]. And they mix it with this rice and it all comes in this pot. You can share with multiple people. The rice has all these herbs and different things in it. Some have different mixes, some are more spicy than others. So tasting multiple kabsas… you're never going to lose with that.\"\nWhen asked to pick a favourite restaurant in town, Dean is hard-pressed. \"You could pick any restaurant. You could pick any hotel. The food is outrageous,\" he says. \"You can tell the people have the passion. I love when a place is so unique that everybody has pride in with it. It's not so rushed. The love is there. The craft is there. What I love about Alula is that the craft is there.\"\nWith its stunning mountains and unique rock formations like Elephant Rock, AlUla has a lot to offer outdoor adventurers. But Dean has special love for the AlUla Skies Festival, a spectacular 10-day autumn event celebrating the city's magnificent skies, from stargazing to Dean's favourite, hot air balloon rides.\n\"That is unbelievable,\" he says. \"I'm not a big fan of hot air balloons. But when I went in AlUla it was just something different. They didn't go too high; I'm a little scared of heights. Ours was at a pretty amazing level where you can go over the Old Town and go over the beautiful landscapes. Seeing where the oasis meets the desert is pretty unique.\"\nDuring the festival, up to 60 hot air balloons lazily circle the sky in both tethered and untethered flights, taking in the sweeping views of Hegra, the Old Town and the endless expanses of desert sand. Participants can also charter helicopter rides, and for those who'd rather stay closer to the ground, there are meditation sessions and cooking classes under the stars.\n5. Best place to learn about the past: Hegra \n\"Hegra is a must, must, must,\" says Dean.\nThere are more than 27,000 archaeological sites in AlUla dating to the late prehistoric period (5200-1200 BCE), but Hegra, also known as Mada'in Saleh, is the most well-known. Inhabited since the 1st Century BCE – and a thriving incense and trading hub until the 12th Century – Hegra is the site of a 1.6-hectare necropolis complex containing 111 boulder-cut monumental decorated and inscribed tombs, beautifully preserved by the arid desert conditions. It was named a Unesco World Heritage site in 2008; Saudi Arabia's first World Heritage property.\n\"You see the structure and the condition and the masterpiece, the masterful architects that built these things way, way, way, way back,\" says Dean. \"It's magical to see.\"\nWhile in Hegra, visitors can opt for an organised bus tour to the ancient city of Dadan and Jabal Ikmah, a 9th-Century BCE \"open-air library\" containing the world's largest concentration of Lihyanite and Dadanitic rock inscriptions, or set off on the Oasis Heritage Trail; a 3km palm-tree shaded walking tour through the AlUla Oasis.\n\"You just have to go to AlUla, period!\" says Dean.\nWebsite: https://www.experiencealula.com/en/plan-your-trip/alula-visitor-centres\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

I'm not yet an intermediate rider, but I'm certainly a stubborn beginner. And a hungry one.\nLuckily, I was – quite literally – on the right track. Launched in April 2022, the Véloroute Gourmande passes more than 100 culinary stops, from farmers' markets and vineyards to casual pubs and elegant farm-to-table restaurants, as it threads through the region's bucolic villages and lake-laced landscape. As a food writer, goose farmer, cooking teacher and restaurant chef, I was keen to turn my attention from the woods where I forage for wild mushrooms and my garden, which abounds with heirloom tomatoes, uncommon herbs and edible flowers, north to explore the culinary heritage of the Québecois countryside. \nMuch of the trail follows a portion of the Route Verte, whose 5,300km crisscross Québec and comprise the longest network of cycling paths in North America. But aside from its length, the main difference between the two routes is that the Véloroute Gourmande was essentially designed as a slow travel food tour. While pedalling across Québec's countryside, cyclists can stop to refuel on gravy-slicked French fries, tarts filled with blueberry jam, coffee gussied up with maple syrup or booze flavoured with boreal herbs, forest mushrooms or wildflowers.\nThe Véloroute's interactive map features 120 icons – including tiny forks, beer glasses and squat jam jars – that denote places to stop for things like golden panini stuffed with house-cured ham and bloomy rind cheese, dark ale delicately scented with spruce tips or wedges of cheese to squash into one's panniers and nosh by the side of the road.\nDespite its name, this \"Gourmande\" trail isn't merely culinary. Organisers also offer suggestions on elegant hotels and charming B&Bs, culturally important sites – such as a Le Vieux Clocher concert hall in Magog and a defunct copper mine that offers underground tours – and every bike shop along the way, in case your derailleur gets derailed on the rail trail.\nAlthough it's possible to tackle the route in either direction, the Véloroute website suggests starting in Montréal and riding east. Given that Montréal is the most likely arrival point for out-of-towners and the biking closest to the city is easiest (read: flatter), allowing cyclists to build up to the longer, hillier days, this makes good sense. Riding east also provides a better chance at a tailwind, although it does increase the climbing by 150m.\nThe initial segment, a 45km pedal from Montréal to the city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, contains 55 of the route's 120 culinary pit stops.

But despite being billed as \"traditionally\" Czech, the dish was adopted from elsewhere.\nIn February 2023, newly-minted United States ambassador to the Czech Republic, Bijan Sabet, uploaded some of his first photos as ambassador to Instagram. The now-deleted post included a couple of shots of cobblestone streets near the US Embassy in Prague and a photo of him holding an ice cream-topped trdelník, a popular tube-shaped pastry.\nThe next day, the Czech press jumped on the photo of the trdelník. \"The first mistake of the new American ambassador\", read the headline in the daily newspaper Mlada Fronta Dnes. Another Czech newspaper, Lidove Noviny, put it in the spectrum of American political scandals by calling it \"TrdelníkGate\". \nSo, what was all the fuss about and how did a pastry cause an international political scandal?\nIf you join the army of tourists in Prague's historical centre, you'll notice that every third or fourth shop – particularly between Old Town Square and Charles Bridge – features 15cm (6in) tubes of dough slowly spinning horizontally on a stick over burning charcoal and a sign above it proclaiming \"Old Czech Specialty\". The scent of caramelised sugar and baked dough wafts from these shops, and at each one, there is often a line out the door.\nMeet the trdelník. Also called \"chimney cakes\", perhaps because they are long-ish and tubular, trdelník gets its name from the stick it slowly spins on as it cooks over coals (trdlo means \"stick\" in Czech).\nWhen I lived in Prague for three years in the 1990s, there were no signs of the trdelník (pronounced: \"ter-del-neek\"). But starting around 2010, I began seeing more and more shops and street stalls selling them. Employees were dressed in historical garb and signs boasted of the pastry's Czech origins. Search for \"Prague\" or \"trdelník\" on TikTok or Instagram and you'll find legions of influencers raving about this \"traditional Czech pastry\".\nThe issue is that the trdelník isn't Czech: it's a sugar-coated riddle wrapped in a doughy mystery inside an ice cream-topped enigma of nebulous origins that tourists appear to love. At the same time, many locals say travellers to their country are being duped into thinking they're indulging in something inherently Czech. On a recent visit to Prague, I decided to try to peel back the flaky dough of the trdelník in order to understand this culinary conundrum and how it came to be a favourite \"old Czech specialty\" among the tourist masses.\nAccording to a Romanian newspaper, the first-known mention of the trdelknik is in a mid-15th-Century manuscript in Heidelberg, Germany. In 1784, it turned up in a cookbook in Transylvania. From there, it seems, the pastry slowly made its way west from Transylvania, anchoring itself throughout Hungary where today it's called kürtöskalács, and eventually finding a warm welcome in the Slovakian town of Skalica. The fact that Skalica became part of Czechoslovakia might partly explain how the pastry ended up catching the attention of Czechs entrepreneurs decades later.\nThe first trdelník shop in the Czech Republic didn't fire up its dough-cooking coals until 2004, when Martin Figura opened a bakery in the country's eastern Moravia region. On his business's website, he claims the pastry comes from Hungary. A year later, another baker, Martin Švarc, opened a trdelník stand in the southern Bohemian tourist town of Česky Krumlov in 2005.\n\"These people inspired me, and I copied their business,\" he told me, referring to the first few people who opened up trdelník bakeries in the country. According to Švarc, trdelník shops started opening in Prague a year or two later. In 2015, someone got the brilliant idea to begin offering a scoop of ice cream on top of the dish and the city's new made-for-tourist dessert was complete. \nBack in Prague, I met up with Janek Rubeš, a journalist whose YouTube channel, the Honest Guide, has 1.4 million subscribers. In his videos, he reveals some local favourites for eating and drinking in Prague, but he has also been very vocal about the trdelník, which has made him the face of anti-trdelník sentiment in his hometown.\nOne of the reasons why the trdelník is so popular with tourists in Prague can be boiled down to a simple and effective marketing technique. \"My mom used to work for an international restaurant chain, and she used to say: if you can smell it and see it from the street, you're likely going to be enticed to try it,\" Rubeš said.  \nRubeš isn't the only Prague resident who is annoyed by the ubiquity of the trdelník and its false association with Czech culinary culture. In December 2022, two theatre students at the  Academy of Performing Arts in Prague made a trdelník-themed project. Anna Hubená, who is studying costume design, created a life-size trdelník costume for Danny Takieddin, an acting student. Scrawled in large letters on the backside of the costume was: \"I AM NOT CZECH TRADITION\". The two of them hit the streets of central Prague as Hubená filmed Takieddin's interactions with tourists. Sometimes the life-size trdelník with legs would be standing next to trdelník-eating tourists – most of whom didn't get the irony, thinking that the plus-sized pastry was actually promoting a trdelník shop. \n\"Mostly only local Czechs appreciated it,\" said Hubená. Takieddin added, \"Even a homeless guy yelled out at us, 'It's from Romania!'\"\nPrague doesn't have a street food tradition. Food here, traditionally consumed in pubs, is meaty, stodgy fare that pairs nicely with a golden-hued pilsner. I can't help but feel that trdelník shop owners are reimagining Czech history for their own financial benefit. The trdelník industry is betting that most visitors to Prague won't have an extensive knowledge of Czech cuisine. Case in point: the American ambassador to the Czech Republic. \"I don’t blame him,\" said Rubeš, of the ambassador's \"TrdelníkGate\" photo. \"If you walk through the centre of Prague and see so many shops selling trdelník, you're going to assume it's a big part of Czech culinary culture.\" \nIt's no coincidence that as tourism numbers have grown in the Czech Republic, so have the number of trdelník shops. In 2003, 20 million foreign travellers visited the nation and there were zero trdelník shops. By 2019, just before Covid restrictions, that number had nearly doubled to 37 million. There are no statistics on the number of trdelník spots in the country, but there is no denying that the trdelník industry has shadowed the rise in tourism.\n\"This is a cautionary tale about how authenticity, when paired with processes of urban touristification, can become a powerful tool for commodification, deceit and appropriation of third-party food traditions – in this case Hungary, Romania and Slovakia,\" said Alessandro Gerosa, a professor of sociology at the University of Milan and author of The Hipster Economy: Taste and Authenticity in Late Modern Capitalism. \"The hostility from local Czechs seems powerless vis-à-vis the pervasiveness of Prague's growing tourism industry.\"\nThe trdelník can be seen as a way to appease travellers seeking out something that appears to be authentically Czech – a sugar-coated symbol of how tourism has transformed the city into something it didn't use to be.   \nJuliana Fischerová, a baker and food writer, said, \"The trdelník likely made its way to Prague because of the festival circuit, such as Christmas markets, which was the only time Czechs would see the pastry up until recent times.\" \nMore like this:• A chicken recipe so good its origin is being fought in court• The English wine that's rivalling Champagne• The underground pasta school in an abandoned Italian ghost town\nFisherová first started seeing trdelník pastries spinning on sticks in Prague about 20 years ago and remembered she had seen the pastry in Slovakia long before that. \"In Prague, it's half the size and twice the price,\" she said. \"The worst crime, though, is that they use very low-quality ingredients at the trdelník shops in Prague. And don't get me started on the quality of the ice cream.\"\nFischerová says that it won’t be long before the pastry enters the canon of Czech cuisine. \"Fried cheese isn't inherently Czech either, but it's been eaten here so long that it's now part of our culinary tradition. [It's] on every pub menu all over the country and, with the exception of Czech food historians, no one questions the authenticity of it.\"\n\"Authenticity\" is a word that popped up over and over in my research on the trdelník. The problem is that \"authenticity\" is a social construct, a subjective term based on a collective perception, so what may seem authentic to one person could feel inauthentic to another.\nThere was an Easter market on Prague's Old Town Square while I was visiting. And to prove Gerosa's point, I asked several trdelník stand employees if the pastry was an authentic Czech product. They all said yes. I then approached a stand selling lángos (fried bread that is indisputably tied to Hungary).\n\"Is lángos an authentic Czech street food?\" I disingenuously asked the woman at the stall. She paused, looked me right in the eye and said, \"Yes. It is traditional Czech street food. Like Czech pizza.\"\nTrdelník purveyors in Prague are engaging in what sociologists call \"impression management\". By evoking an imagined historical community of costume-clad Bohemians cooking the trdelník on a stick over coals, they're not only commodifying the culture of neighbouring nations, but selling visitors a fabricated version of their own. \nBut does any of this really matter when hordes of tourists are literally and figuratively eating up the trdelnik? Is it really that delicious?\nWhen I finished chatting with Rubeš at a cafe in central Prague, we walked out onto the street together. Rubeš spotted a sanitary worker emptying public rubbish bins and asked the worker, \"What is the most common thing that you find in the trash in the centre of Prague?\" The sanitation worker rolled his eyes and said, \"Trdelník. When tourists eat through the ice cream towards the top, they just throw out the fried dough. They barely even eat the thing.\"\nI have to confess that after witnessing the birth and extreme growth of Prague's trdelník industry over the last 20 years, I had never tasted one. So, on my penultimate day in Prague, I purchased a sugar-coated pastry (minus the add-on ice cream) at a stand at the Old Town Square. It was flaky and soft but so bland it was almost tasteless. Like nearly every trdelník-consuming tourist in Prague, I ate about half of it before it got cold and rigor mortis-like, and then tossed the rest of it in the bin. \nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly listed the country where Skalica is located.

Yet, it also marks the site of one of the most tragic historical events for the area's Native residents.\nIn 1862, facing starvation and displacement by white settlers, a group of Dakota attacked white settlements, setting off a five-week war that led the US government to exile the Dakota from their ancestral homeland and forcibly relocate them to reservations in the Dakotas and Nebraska. That winter, the Dakota were held at Bdote and Fort Snelling, guarded by US troops while waiting for the river to thaw so they could be sent away on boats. The sacred site soon became a mass grave, as hundreds of people died from disease and malnutrition during the winter.\nNearly a century later, following the Indian Relocation Act of 1956 in which Native Americans were incentivised by the US government to relocate from reservations to cities, many Dakota began returning to the area. Now, more than 50 years after activists in Minneapolis spearheaded the modern fight for Native American rights, the Twin Cities are experiencing something of an Indigenous cultural renaissance and are one of the best places to explore modern Native culture in the US today.\nThis cultural revival was inspired by decades of discrimination following the Relocation Act. Mike Forcia, a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, remembers moving with his family to inner-city Saint Paul in 1969. Over the next decade, his family moved back and forth between Saint Paul and the reservation, as his father struggled to hold a stable job. \"As I grew up, I realised many families bounced around and it was not just our family that couldn't make it,\" he said. \"We were told we were free and to assimilate. That was so hard for some of our people, and many turned to drugs and alcohol.\"\nIn addition to the personal trauma and struggle to find footing off the reservation, Indigenous communities faced immense discrimination. \"At the time, Minneapolis' Franklin Avenue, which was the heart of the Indigenous community, was lined with bars,\" said Forcia. \"Police would come and line people up and fill cars with Natives. There were stories of people getting picked up, beaten and thrown by the river.\"\nIn the summer of 1968, roughly 200 members of Minneapolis' Indigenous community gathered to address the police brutality and racial profiling of Native Americans. It was the birth of the American Indian Movement (AIM), which became the driving force behind the modern Indigenous civil rights movement. \"We decided we would no longer be pushed to the margins,\" said Forcia, who now serves as AIM's chairperson.\nIn 1972, AIM representatives occupied the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in Washington DC as part of the Trail of Broken Treaties protests. AIM chapters spread across the US in the 1970s, and members organised protests, provided social services and advocated for the revival of cultural traditions.\nToday, AIM still advocates for Native sovereignty from its Minneapolis headquarters, and prominent local leaders like Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan (White Earth Band of Ojibwe) – the highest-ranking Native American woman elected to executive office in the US – are helping to protect and highlight Indigenous culture. Now, Native artists, chefs, authors, activists and community workers in the Twin Cities are creating spaces of healing, reconciliation and storytelling to restore ancestral traditions.\n\"We're witnessing a Native awakening on a national scale, with unprecedented representation in realms from pop culture to politics,\" noted Kate Nelson a local writer of Tlingit origin. \"Amid this, Minneapolis has emerged as an epicentre for Indigenous creativity, from art to food to music and more.\"\nThe heart of Minneapolis' contemporary Indigenous community is Franklin Avenue East, where a veritable gallery of Native-designed street art is splashed across many of the area's fading buildings.

In the early 1870s, the development of the mill industry on the river and a concrete apron built on the falls changed the water's natural flow and desecrated the land and islands around it, including Wíta Wanáǧi, which was a sacred spot for Dakota women to give birth.\nMore like this: • Owamni: A (r)evolution of Indigenous foods • Miami's little-known Indigenous history• The Indigenous tribes reclaiming travel\n\"Land and cultural restoration in Dakota are one and the same. Taking care of the land is our culture,\" said Shelley Buck, Bdewakantunwan Dakota and president of Owámniyomni Okhódayapi, which aims to restore the falls. \"Owámniyomni is our living relative. The water, the land, the birds are our relatives. Industrialisation destroyed the river, exploiting it as a commodity.\"\nLoosely translating to \"Friends of the Falls\" in Dakota, Owámniyomni Okhódayapi was formed in 2016 with the goal of restoring the land and eventually returning it to the Dakota. The vision is for Owámniyomni to be a place where Dakota culture and history can be celebrated. Currently, visitors can join a guided tour or take an independent walk along the river and follow interpretive signs describing the area's historical and cultural significance in both Dakota and English.\nTo dive deeper into Dakota history, join Learning From Place: Bdote for a tour led by Dakota guides who bring visitors to three places of Indigenous historical and spiritual significance. The morning starts at scenic Fort Snelling State Park in Saint Paul, where a drumming ceremony punctuates the chilling story of the concentration camps that once lined the Bdote. The tour then continues to the Indian Mounds Regional Park burial site and Oȟéyawahe/Pilot Knob Preservation Site, which was a sacred Dakota burial ground that has been preserved with natural grasses and trails. Public tours are offered several times per year, including as part of the Twin Cities' annual Great Northern Festival (23 January to 2 February 2025).\nAs more galleries, restaurants and organisations honour the Twin Cities' Indigenous past and present, a feeling of Native pride is blossoming after centuries of hardship.\n\"I encourage people to take the time to really engage with the Native history and culture of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, and to take in the fullness of Indigenous life here, with both its joys and traumas,\" said Nelson.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

Both archaeological findings and oral histories passed down through generations indicate that Indigenous peoples have been inhabiting the area for nearly 6,000 years.\nToday, visitors flock to Winnipeg for its world-renowned museums, festivals, parks and the welcoming spirit reflected in the province's license plate motto: \"Friendly Manitoba\". But for millennia, the area now known as Winnipeg — the city was incorporated and named in 1873 — was a hub where Indigenous nations like the Cree, Ojibwe, Dakota, Ojibwe-Cree and Dene would gather to hold ceremonies, trade goods and share knowledge.\nWe asked Niigaan Sinclair, professor of Indigenous Studies at the University of Manitoba, to tell us the best places where visitors can explore Winnipeg's Indigenous history. For Sinclair, a member of the Anishinaabe (Ojibwa) Nation, Winnipeg remains an epicentre of Indigenous values. And because the city is home to the largest Indigenous population in Canada, where one in five people are Indigenous, he believes it is ground zero for reconciliation between cultures.\n\"Name me a place where reconciliation has been in activity the longest, and it's Manitoba,\" says Sinclair, noting the first of the numbered treaties (Treaty 1) between the Canadian government and Canada's Indigenous people was signed in 1871 at Lower Fort Garry, 20 miles north of Winnipeg. \"I do all the things that I do because I think Winnipeg is a remarkable place.\"\nHere is Sinclair's guide to Indigenous Winnipeg.\nSince being designated a national historic site in 1974, The Forks, a public event space in downtown Winnipeg, has become the city's number-one tourist attraction, welcoming four million visitors a year and hosting a wealth of community celebrations and recreational activities. It's also where extensive archaeological investigations have proved that several Aboriginal groups lived here thousands of years ago.\nCalled the Forks because it's situated at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, the area remains a place of importance to Winnipeg's Indigenous community; in particular the Oodena Celebration Circle where events such as Canada's National Indigenous Peoples Day (21 June), winter and summer solstices, healing ceremonies and the recent National Day of Truth and Reconciliation – more commonly known as Orange Shirt Day (30 September) – are held.\n\"It’s become the Indigenous centre of Winnipeg,\" says Sinclair. \"Anything that happens in the community of significance is often held there … that's why I love it so much.\"\nWebsite: www.theforks.comAddress: Forks Market Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3C 4S8Phone: (204) 927-7874Instagram: @theforkswinnipeg\nThe Métis – one of Canada's three recognised Indigenous peoples – are a distinct Indigenous people with both First Nations and Euro settler (mostly French) ancestry that arose in the late 1700s in Western Canada. Today, it is estimated there are 450,000 Métis Nation citizens in Canada, with approximately 48,000 living in Winnipeg.\nPerhaps the most famous Métis historical figure is Louis Riel, born in Winnipeg's Saint Boniface neighbourhood in 1844. The heart of Manitoba's Francophone community and the Francophone capital of Western Canada, Saint Boniface is located directly across the Red River from the Forks and downtown Winnipeg; accessible by walking across the beautiful Esplanade Riel Footbridge.\nRiel was a central figure in the 1869-70 Red River Resistance that saw Metis people challenge the nascent Canadian government in an ill-fated bid for self-determination. Riel advocated for the culture of the Métis people and challenged Canadian government policies regarding language, religion and land rights, ultimately resulting in his execution for treason in 1885. In 2016, the government of Manitoba recognised Riel as the first leader of Manitoba.\nRiel's gravesite is on the grounds of Saint Boniface Cathedral, built in 1832. \"I spend a lot of time visiting Riel’s grave,\" says Sinclair. \"At least yearly, I go there to pay my respects and lay some tobacco.

It also inspired Red Dress Day (5 May) – also known as National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and Two-Spirit People.\nThere are many reminders of the MMIWG2S+ issue throughout Winnipeg: signs, license plates, homemade posters, graffiti, people hanging red dresses in their yards and a number of monuments.\n\"The issue is elsewhere of course, but the most innovative ways of addressing it come from Winnipeg,\" Sinclair says. \"The community is fully engaged with wanting to deal with this issue.\"\nWebsite: www.jaimeblackartist.com/exhibitions/Address: 85 Israel Asper Way, Winnipeg, MB R3C 0L5, CanadaPhone: (877) 877-6037Instagram: @humanrights.ca\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}
{"doc_id": 15, "question": "What is the name of the viral trend where passengers avoid all forms of entertainment and sustenance during long flights?", "answer": ["Raw-dogging"], "doc": "The viral trend of enduring long flights with no phones, screens or distractions recently captured the world's attention. But what if we remain unplugged once we step off a plane?\nIt's all about the power of the mind – or so they say. The viral trend of \"raw-dogging\" long flights, where passengers stare straight ahead without any in-flight entertainment, books, music or screens, and refrain from eating, drinking or sleeping for the entire journey, captured the world's attention this summer. Manchester City forward Erling Haaland posted a video of himself on a seven-hour flight, boasting \"no phone, no sleep, no water, no food\". He wasn't the only celebrity to get in on the act, with Australian music producer Torren Foot and actor and musician Jared Leto also sharing their respective 15- and 17- hour raw-dogging experiences.\nWhile it may be easy to dismiss raw-dogging (and its rather obscene name) as foolish or even nihilistic, it undoubtedly says something about our digital dependency: we're so reliant on external stimuli that going without distractions for several hours is now considered a \"challenge\". Yet, studies have shown that focusing on the present and being mindful can have a positive impact on health and wellbeing, including reducing anxiety, depression and blood pressure while improving sleep. Excessive smartphone use, meanwhile, can be detrimental to our physical and mental well-being, and it impacts everything from our sleep routines to our musculoskeletal health. That should be your cue to power off and sit up straighter.\nAs with every viral challenge, there's a darker side to raw-dogging. Medical professionals warn that in extreme cases, where participants avoid drinking water, moving or even using the bathroom on long flights, the viral trend is so dangerous it could even kill you.\nWhile avoiding external stimuli is counterintuitive to travel, I still wondered whether there was something deeper or even mindful about the digital detox part of the raw-dogging trend that I could apply to my trip once I stepped off a plane.\nIf one of the great purposes of travel is seeking out new experiences and escaping our regular routines, why are we so tethered to the same devices and screens we rely on back home? I thought it would feel refreshing to turn off my phone for the entirety of a trip. Perhaps this mental cleanse, free from apps and notifications, would allow me to connect more deeply with a new setting and rediscover the way people have travelled throughout history.\nI decided to apply this part of raw-dogging a flight to raw-dogging a destination: no phone, no social media, no distractions; just a traveller absorbing a new environment while trying to stay as present as possible in the moment.\nThe Spanish city of Palma, Mallorca, may not seem like an obvious place for a mindful retreat. Its reputation as a sun-soaked playground, where many tourists do little more than tan, party and sip cocktails is one of many reasons why residents have recently pushed back against overtourism. As the city has increasingly become flooded by partiers and selfie-takers, locals are now fighting to reclaim it. By keeping my phone off, my aim was to meet these people, listen to their recommendations and explore a more soulful side of the city.\nUpon arriving, I decided against jumping on a bus or hailing a taxi, embracing the city's surprisingly walkable nature by travelling from the airport to my lodging by foot. The directions were easy to remember: get to the beach, turn left and follow the coastline until I reached my street. Without music or a podcast, I listened to the sounds of distant waves hitting the beach and the way locals wove in and out of Spanish and Mallorca's other official language, Mallorquín, a variation of Catalan. This soundtrack accompanied my first glimpse of Palma: its distinctive honey-hued stone buildings, its dramatic Gothic and Baroque buildings and – yes – the many foreign visitors crowding the beaches.\nI'm so used to consulting that live dot on my phone's Google Maps app, that without it, I began to worry that I'd gone the wrong way. I asked a group of elderly women sitting outside a cafe if I was heading in the right direction, showing them the address scribbled on the inside of my notebook cover. They nodded, and with a few gestures and finger-pointing, they steered me towards my destination.\nAfter a brief swim in the sea, I took a bus to Palma's historic centre where I met a 23-year-old Turkish man named Erten, who had been studying in Mallorca. I asked him for his recommendations, and soon, Mallorcans sitting nearby chimed in with their own suggestions. One lady pointed out of the window at the pop-up markets lining the streets. Shaking her head dismissively, she remarked, \"These markets are for tourists. If you want a real market, go to Santa Catalina. It's much better.\"\nErten was a pastry aficionado, and he insisted no visit to Palma was complete without eating an ensaïmada (a traditional coil-shaped Mallorcan pastry traditionally stuffed with lard and enjoyed with coffee). As a vegan, I didn't hold out much hope, but as I'd soon learn, each bakery seems to offer its own take on the delicacy.\nAfter getting off the bus, I came across a family-run bakery called Fornet de la Soca that has been specialising in reviving once-forgotten Mallorcan pastries and breads for the past 14 years. The owners use rediscovered varieties of Mallorcan flour (such as vestit and xeixa) to make their canyalons (cream-filled pastries), robiols (lamb- or fruit-stuffed turnovers) and ensaïmadas.\nThe bakery's sweeter ensaïmadas were filled with fruits from Sóller, an idyllic nearby town that customers at the bakery insisted I should visit. An elderly lady (carrying a bag full of ensaïmadas for her grandchildren) told me Sóller is known for its agricultural heritage – especially its prized citrus fruits. As if noticing my interest had been piqued, an otherwise quiet woman chimed in excitedly, \"And you take a wooden train to get there!\"\nThat settled it, I decided. I'd board a vintage train the following afternoon.\nMore like this: • The town that banned influencers • Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers • How a viral ad campaign is teaching us to 'life-see', not sightsee\nSoundtracked by the gentle rattle of old wooden carriages, the train ride to Sóller took me back in time. As we began to leave Palma's cobbled streets behind, the bars packed with German and British tourists slowly disappeared, and were replaced by lush valleys and rugged peaks. On our slow ascent up the Unesco-inscribed Serra de Tramuntana mountain range, I marvelled at Mallorca's \"backbone\", and felt grateful to the locals who pushed me out of the city centre.\nHaving already spent more than an hour inside Palma's stunning La Seu Cathedral that morning, I was happy to admire Sóller's Gothic Sant Bartomeu Church from its nearby square. As I sat with a coffee, I started talking to an older Mallorcan man who had lived in Sóller for most of his life. He said you could smell the strong aroma of oranges on the outskirts of the town, inhaling deeply for full effect. When he found out I was Irish, he became more animated and started clicking his fingers until the words came to him. \"Star Trek!\" he finally exclaimed. It turned out that Irish actor Colm Meaney (or \"Miles O'Brien\" to Trekkies) had lived nearby.\nBack in Palma, I continued to wander and seek out local stories. Near the bay in the city's historic fishing neighbourhood of El Jonquet, windmills decorated the skyline. A woman organising boat tours at the marina told me they date back to the 14th Century, explaining that these landmarks offer glimpses into Mallorca's rural past, when they were used to grind grain and pump water. In total, there are around 3,000 preserved on the island. \"They are symbols of our history,\" she added, with more than a hint of pride.\nDuring my stay, I made a point to ask as many Mallorcans as I could how they wished tourists would behave when visiting their island. Aside from keeping their shirts on when stumbling through Palma's Old Town, one of the most common answers was for visitors to take more of an interest in local culture.\n\"Every place in the Old Town of Palma has its own history. I really like it when people ask us about ours and why we chose that area,\" said Andrea Santioana, who opened vegan restaurant Ca n’Ela with her mother four years ago. \"The Mallorcan stone has a stunning, authentic beauty, and the rich history of each street is enchanting.\"\nWhile having a phone meant that I didn't feel compelled to tick off a list of sights and could instead absorb Palma more on my own terms, it wasn't without its challenges. The idea of stumbling across a vegan spot is appealing until hunger kicks in, at which point you're ready to settle for a portion of generic Spanish patatas bravas (potatoes in tomato sauce). It's a good thing I didn't, though, as I savoured every bite of a seitan dish topped with lemon cream at Ca n’Ela.\nIn the end, my trip to Palma and Sóller reaffirmed the value of staying present in our increasingly distracted world. I often lean on online recommendations when I travel, but by casting my phone aside and relying only on local recommendations, I rediscovered the joy of spontaneity and connection at the core of travel. While our screens can make for convenient travel companions, they can also get in the way of simple joys like following your curiosity down a street, approaching a stranger and allowing yourself to get lost while wandering through a new neighbourhood.\nOn the plane ride home, I felt the urge to dig into my bag and power my phone on. Instead, I took out my notepad and spent the flight documenting where my conversations led me. These memories were far more meaningful than anything I could scroll through later.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

Though recently questioned for their accuracy by demographers, the Blue Zones were discovered and coined by National Geographic journalist Dan Buettner, who claimed to identify regions where people lived longer, healthier lives, in large part due to a combination of culture, lifestyle, diet and community.\nSingapore was the first new region to be added to the Blue Zones in decades (dubbed a \"Blue Zone 2.0\" by Buettner) and stands apart from the other Blue Zones in part because the longevity of its people comes more from forward-thinking policies than long-established cultural traditions in other Blue Zone communities like Ikaria, Greece or Nicoya, Costa Rica. \nBut it's not just the quantity of life, but also the quality of life that residents here appreciate. We spoke to a few of them to understand which policies and practices make their lives healthier, and happier – and what they recommend to others seeking to live here in search of a longer life. \nResidents in Singapore have witnessed the government's gradual policy changes that affect their health and wellness.\n\"Having grown up here, I've seen firsthand the transformation in community health consciousness,\" said resident Firdaus Syazwani, who runs the financial advice blog Dollar Bureau. \"The heavy taxation on cigarettes and alcohol coupled with stringent public smoking bans not only improves individual health but also enhances public spaces, making them more welcoming and cleaner. No more second-hand smoke!\"\nHe was surprised to learn about the Blue Zone designation, if only because of the high amount of sugar, salt and coconut milk used in local dishes. But even that's changing (if slowly) because of policy. \"Given our local cuisine's penchant for richer ingredients, the Health Promotion Board has initiatives to encourage healthier dietary choices among residents,\" he explained. \"Measures like mandatory nutritional labelling and the reduction of sugar content in beverages have made a noticeable difference in public health awareness and choices. Although it's yet to be known exactly how effective this initiative is, I personally tend to steer away from sugary drinks when I see these labels.\"\nSingapore's healthcare system has also received global accolades for both its quality of care and its ability to keep costs contained. The 2023 Legatum Prosperity Index ranked the country the best in the world as it relates to citizens' health and their ability to access healthcare. The country offers universal healthcare coverage, but also has a mix of private services and savings funds to help cover out-of-pocket expenses.\nBut it's not just healthcare that plays a role in residents living longer lives. Other policies like robust public transportation encourage walking and daily exercise, while a prioritisation on keeping the country clean and beautiful also gives residents a sense of security and calm.\n\"Government initiatives that prioritise the seamless integration of parks, gardens and nature reserves into the cityscape have earned [Singapore] the reputation of being a 'garden city',\" said Charu Kokate, senior partner at Safdie Architects, who also was the project lead behind the firm's iconic buildings like Sky Habitat Residential Towers and Jewel Changi Airport. \"After living in Singapore for more than 15 years, I am constantly impressed by how the Urban Redevelopment Authority has meticulously planned the city. Their focus on sustainability, efficient land use and incorporating green spaces into urban life is remarkable. While Singapore's laws can be strict, they have resulted in a clean and well-maintained environment.\"\nMore like this:• What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024• The European region where young people are happiest• Why Switzerland is home to two of the world's most liveable cities\nOne of her favourite places to visit is the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Located in the city centre, it's the only tropical garden to be recognised as a Unesco World Heritage site. \"Its remarkable orchid collection and focus on plant research and conservation make it a haven for nature lovers, families and tourists seeking peace and beauty,\" she said.\nThe public parks also serve as a hub for community, a factor that all longevity researchers agree is essential to living a long, healthy life. \"From young adults to seniors, you'll find a wide demographic engaged in regular exercise, facilitated by extensive public parks, fitness corners and gym classes that are easily accessible throughout the city,\" said Syazwani.\nFor those considering a move here, embracing that community spirit and lifestyle is key. He recommends East Coast Park, a stretch of beach that has plenty of picnic options and room to walk while taking in the sea breeze.\nThough the quality of life can be high in Singapore, the price of living here is also commensurate. The country is often ranked as one of the world's most expensive places to live, with Mercer ranking it second after Hong Kong.\nThough the population is diverse, with people emigrating here from across the world, the government prioritises a strong sense of social cohesion, enforced through laws and enforcement. The state has strict laws (and penalties) against littering, smoking in public, drugs and even jaywalking, but many residents find the regulations help keep the country a safer and more beautiful place to live. \n\"The government's policies are carefully aligned with the needs of the population, focusing on improving the overall quality of life, supporting economic stability and maintaining social harmony,\" said Kokate. \"Singapore's political stability plays a key role in fostering an environment that encourages business investment, economic growth and social cohesion.\"\nThat said, the country also celebrates its diversity, especially in the form of the country's world-renowned food scene and annual festivals, from Chinese New Year to Deepavali (Diwali) to the International Festival of the Arts. \n\"The city has something for everyone, regardless of age,\" said Kokate. \"The multicultural society embraces a wide range of traditions, creating a rich and vibrant cultural experience that enhances the stay for both visitors and expats.\" \nLiving In is a series from BBC Travel that discovers what it's like to reside in some of the world's top destinations. \n-- \nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}
{"doc_id": 17, "question": "What is the name of the restaurant that Chef Alvaro Clavijo considers the best for traditional Colombian food in Bogotá?", "answer": ["Tolú (Mamá Luz)"], "doc": "Chef Alvaro Clavijo runs one of the world's best restaurants. Here's where he dines in his hometown, from traditional markets to fine dining restaurants.\nShrouded by the cloud of decades of armed conflict between the government and several waves of guerilla groups, from the 1960s until fairly recently, Colombia was largely considered a place to be avoided. Violence drove out talent and even tourism-dependent sectors like fine dining saw many people pursue careers abroad. But the 2016 Peace Treaty brought relative stability, and with it came droves of tourists and the return of previously expatriated locals. Among them was chef Alvaro Clavijo, who came back to Bogotá after almost a decade overseas and opened El Chato, which has repeatedly been recognised as one of the world's best restaurants.\nColombia now attracts travellers eager to see its rugged variety of landscapes, sip its famous coffee and try its renowned food. But Clavijo points out that \"people always want to go to Medellín, Santa Marta or the coffee region. They use Bogotá only as a stop to get to other places\". The gritty capital, however, is Colombia's culinary jewel, uniting flavours from all over the country: from cheesy arepas to barbecue from eastern Colombia's Llanos cowboy region, seafood from the coasts and river treasures from the Amazon. The city is also the epicentre of Colombia's most experimental cuisine.\n\"Bogotá has an incredible [gastronomic] offer that didn't exist some years ago,\" says Clavijo. \"You have a great variety of restaurants all over, and you can find anything from young chefs who are coming back to do their projects, to those who've been working here for years, as well as traditional restaurants that, fortunately, still exist.\"\nHere are Clavijo's top picks for eating out in Bogotá.\nClavijo is an ardent fan of traditional Colombian food and the food markets (mercados) that serve it. Though there are several throughout the city, he highlights La Perseverancia, where you can buy fresh meats and produce, or sit down for a delicious and affordable meal. Clavijo calls the market's restaurateurs \"exporters of tradition\" – a title that well befits Luz Dary Collogo, owner of the homey food stand, Tolú (Mamá Luz). According to Clavijo, this is an unmissable spot in La Perse (as locals call the market), and \"a must\" in the city.\nTolú serves traditional dishes from Colombia's Caribbean coast and the regions surrounding Bogotá like shrimp ceviche and goat stew. Clavijo also claims that Tolú \"has the best ajiaco (a hearty chicken and potato soup) in the city.\" He adds that the spot \"is a key stop on a must-do tour of Colombian food\" in the chilly capital, and that he wishes \"more restaurateurs would focus on this type of food\". Netflix's \"Street Food: Latin America\" featured Mamá Luz – as Collogo is affectionately called – for her famed home-style dishes that fill the soul and taste like someone's grandma made them.\nWebsite: https://www.facebook.com/TolurestauranteAddress: Calle 30a #4a-6, BogotáPhone: +57 311-480-9420Instagram: @tolurestaurante\nNeo-Colombian restaurants tend to focus on local ingredients cooked with techniques their chefs have brought from abroad, but Mini-Mal stands apart in its obsession with tradition. For Clavijo, Mini-Mal is \"the flagship\" contemporary Colombian restaurant; he even questions if he should call it \"modern\".\n\"I would present it as traditional food,\" he says. \"They have actually tried to rescue tradition … It's the Colombian restaurant that has done the most to bring all of the country's suppliers, techniques and keepers of tradition to the foreground. [They do this] better than anyone else!\"\nAt this laid-back experimental kitchen, \"you can eat a cubio (an Andean tuber) with a technique that is actually from [the region of] Boyaca,\" Clavijo explains. \"They don't modify [the techniques], they put them on the menu.\" Taking advantage of the country's incredible biodiversity and richness of ingredients, the menu offers items like \"dog-ear\" arepas (thin maize flatbreads folded to resemble a canine ear), or braised beef topped with tucupí (a yellow Amazonian sauce extracted from the cassava root) and big-bottomed ants (hormigas culonas). For Clavijo, the spot just might be \"the first [modern] restaurant that made real Colombian food.\"\nWebsite: https://mini-mal.org/Address: Transversal 4 Bis #56A-52, BogotáPhone: +57 601-455-0630Instagram: @restauranteminimalBogotá\nPrudencia – a speakeasy-like restaurant in Bogotá's historic La Candelaria neighbourhood –   focuses on international recipes made with techniques from the countryside. Hidden behind the simple facade of a graffiti-streaked 18th-Century colonial home, this exclusive establishment requires patrons to knock on a shut door in order to enter. Open only for lunch, it allows up to 36 diners at a time. Its seven-course menu changes every month, never to be repeated; having recently featured wood-roasted lamb ragu braised in Sauvignon Blanc and wood-charred carrot and squash purée. Clavijo calls it \"one of the best [restaurants] in Bogotá\".\nFor him, Prudencia \"stands out for its technique, and its investigation of ingredients.

Clavijo calls these empanadas \"the perfect meal\" for any time of day because they're convenient, confessing that he \"can't pass by one of their locations and not buy [one], especially because they don't just have pipián [empanadas], but also cheese, Bogotánian (white and yellow potato and minced beef), [Cauca department-style] Vallunas (maize and yuca dough stuffed with white and yellow potato and shredded beef) and other [types of] empanadas.\"\nClavijo also recommends the empanadas from Las Margaritas, a lunch spot located inside a traditional house in the Chapinero neighbourhood. Since 1902, people have come to the restaurant mostly for its signature handmade empanadas, made with crispy maize flour dough stuffed with rice and shredded beef. Though the menu offers other home-style Colombian dishes like grain-based cuchuco soup and cow tongue, the empanadas steal the show. Clavijo notes that this stronghold of tradition has reduced its hours and worries that it might close as other historic restaurants have.

{"doc_id": 18, "question": "When does Durga Puja start in 2023?", "answer": ["9 October"], "doc": "Durga Puja, one of the biggest annual Hindu festivals, starts on 9 October and idol-makers across Bangladesh are working round the clock. This year, amidst a backdrop of recent political upheaval and reported attacks on Hindu minorities, this celebration of good over evil feels particularly poignant.\nAs the festival of Durga Puja approaches, villages and towns across Bangladesh fill with anticipation. While the event is celebrated by millions across India and Nepal, in Bangladesh, where Hindus make up about 8% of the 170 million population, Durga Puja carries a special significance. It has become a cultural phenomenon, with people from various backgrounds, including the Muslim majority, enjoying the dazzling spectacles, colourful processions and festivities. Yet, for Bangladesh’s Hindu community, Durga Puja is much more than just a celebration – it’s a deeply spiritual occasion that brings them together; a chance to strengthen communal bonds.\nThis year, however, the festival unfolds against a more politically charged backdrop. The recent ousting of Sheikh Hasina’s government, fuelled by student-led protests and reported attacks on Hindu minorities, have heightened tensions. Yet, Durga Puja stands as a symbol of resilience and unity in an increasingly polarised society. Amid this political upheaval, the festival offers a moment of collective hope and reflection. For the last few weeks, idol-makers in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, have been working tirelessly to create the divine figures that will soon be the heart of this celebration and worshipped by millions, affirming their cultural and religious heritage in challenging times.\nTucked away in one of the countless narrow alleys of Old Dhaka's historic Shakhari Bazar is the workshop of Balai Pal, the city's most sought-after idol sculptor. The bazaar's labyrinthine paths and unmarked doors can bewilder even the most determined explorer; finding this place, surrounded by the honking of rickshaws and the tantalising scent of biryani, is nearly impossible without guidance. \nEmbedded in brick buildings – some dating back 400 years – are small temples adorned with intricate deity idols. These temples remind us that this is the heart of the city's 1.5 million Hindu population. Shakhari Bazaar is considered Dhaka's epicentre for vibrant Hindu festivals, with Durga Puja being the largest and most important religious event for Bangladesh’s Hindu minority.\nAfter passing through a narrow passage and a small metal gate into a courtyard, I arrive at the Sri Sri Pran Ballabh Jeu Mandir workshop, which has remained relatively unchanged for nearly 130 years. In these modest confines, beneath a makeshift tin roof, extraordinary artistry unfolds. A team of 16 men, led by Pal, tirelessly work around the clock in shifts to transform humble materials into divine figures. These idols will soon be worshipped by hundreds of thousands of the city’s Hindus during the five-day festival, which culminates on 13 October.\nStepping inside the workshop instantly transports you to another realm. The air pollution and honking horns vanish, replaced by cool shade, the rhythmic strokes of brushes and the earthy scent of hay and damp soil. Apart from the occasional quiet exchange between artisans, the atmosphere is so hushed you can almost hear their breathing. Each craftsman is deeply absorbed, meticulously shaping divine figures with unwavering focus, their dedication evident in every sculpted detail. The workshop operates year-round, crafting idols of several gods for various Hindu festivals, including Kali Puja, Maha Shivaratri and Diwali. However, Durga Puja is by far their busiest time of year, as the demand for idols of Goddess Durga and her children peaks during this celebration.\nI am captivated by the statues of Goddess Durga, lovingly called \"Durga Maa\". The Durga Puja honours her descent to Earth and victory over the demon Mahishasura, symbolising the triumph of good over evil. It tells the story of how the goddess leaves her spiritual realm for five days every autumn to visit her mortal devotees, allowing them to be seen by her. During this time, her spirit is believed to inhabit the idols made in her image, serving as a bridge between the divine and her earthly worshipers, who seek her blessings for strength and protection. These intricately designed idols, crafted over several months, depict Durga wielding weapons and riding a lion or tiger. Devotees worship these idols in colourful pandals, temples and homes, offering prayers and gifts to the goddess's spirit within them.\nFor these artisans, creating idols is a form of puja (worship), an act of devotion to the deities that they hope will win them favour. \"It's the power of Durga that enables me to work so many hours and so hard,\" says Neelandri, one of the longest-serving artisans here. \"Durga Maa guides us and moves our limbs to create her image from earthly materials.\" The artisans believe their work is sacred and refrain from eating meat or drinking alcohol while making the Durga idols.\nPal, one of the most esteemed idol artisans in the country, is the owner of this workshop. He proudly tells me it is the biggest of its kind in Dhaka – a claim confirmed by the locals I ask – and that his family have been making idols in this workshop for three generations. Now 55, Pal started making idols alongside his father when he was just 10. “It was the lord that chose me for this role,” Pal tells me, as he masterfully draws an eye. “It’s a blessing for us to have been chosen to serve our [gods].”\n \nArtisans typically work around eight to nine hours a day, taking Fridays off, to perfect their creations. However, during Durga Puja, the busiest time of the year, they often extend their hours to more than 12 or 13 hours every day. They even eat and sleep in the workshop during the weeks leading up to the festival. Despite the physical exhaustion, the artisans tell me that the spirit of Durga fuels their dedication, motivating them to continue. They understand that the timely completion of the idols brings joy and devotion to worshippers. As the deadline approaches, the air buzzes with a mix of excitement and pressure, encapsulating the emotional weight of their craft.\nArtisans employ centuries-old techniques to craft the idols, with the process beginning four to five weeks before Durga Puja. No moulds are used; instead, they construct frames from bamboo, wood, yarn and straw before applying thick layers of soil and clay by hand. After a white base is painted onto the idols, Pal meticulously paints intricate details, especially the eyes and face, while supervising other craftsmen. The entire process, taking hours of delicate brushwork. ensures each piece epitomises the beauty of Goddess Durga.\nPal says that long before his grandfather started working in this profession, the idols were a lot more minimalistic. However, over time, they have become increasingly complex and colourful. With the advent of social media, worshippers and idol-makers alike now take inspiration from contemporary styles and designs – particularly the latest trends sported by Bollywood actresses, which have made their way onto Durga’s outfits and jewellery. \nMore like this:• A tenacious nation built on shape-shifting land• Bangladesh's fiery, inventive spin on rice• An archipelago of killer cats\nFor example, the cotton-and-silk Bangladeshi saris that traditionally adorned the idols were earthy in tone with minimal embellishments. In recent years, however, these have been largely replaced by synthetic fabrics that are vibrant in colour, use modern draping techniques and are heavily embellished for glamour.\nPal's clients are mainly Puja committees – groups of about 50 community elders who manage temples and oversee religious events like Durga Puja and ensure that idol procurement reflects the community's artistic, religious and cultural values. Pal earns 800,000-900,000 Bangladeshi taka (£5,000-£5,800) during Durga Puja, making it his most profitable time of year. This is significantly higher than the average Bangladeshi salary of around £2,500 per year. Despite this, Pal insists that his motivation is devotion, not money.\n \nThe final day of Durga Puja, Bijoya Dashami, signifies Goddess Durga's return to her celestial abode. Devotees form lively processions around Shakhari Bazaar, chanting, singing and dancing as they carry the idols to Dhaka’s Buriganga River. There, they gently immerse the idols in the water, bidding farewell as the holy figures slowly dissolve – a symbol of the goddess's departure to her husband, Lord Shiva. The atmosphere is a poignant mix of joy and sorrow, celebrating the goddess's presence while feeling the emotional weight of her parting. With this ritual, the autumn Durga Puja concludes, and, as generations before them, Pal and his team can rest, knowing their devotion and craft have been enough for another year. \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

{"doc_id": 19, "question": "What is the length of the National Famine Way?", "answer": ["165km"], "doc": "The 165km (103 miles) National Famine Way from Strokestown to Dublin is a harrowing but deeply impactful route that allows modern walkers to follow in the footsteps of the Strokestown tenants.\nStrokestown was a welcome reprieve after our three-hour coach ride from Dublin, predominantly bending through winding country lanes. The small town in Roscommon, Ireland's central bog county, has a \"one-horse\" feel; its popular pub, J Beirne, is accessed through a simply labelled, plain white door in the back of a grocery store. A 2022 census cited a total population of just 850. However, Strokestown is not just a small community in rural Ireland – it's the trailhead for a trek commemorating the most tragic walk in Irish history. \nMy father and I had come here to hike the National Famine Way, a 165km heritage trail that connects Strokestown with the shoreside capital of Dublin. The route, dotted with bronze shoe trail markers, was launched in 2020 to commemorate 1,490 Strokestown residents who made this same journey on foot in 1847 after being forced out by their Anglo-Irish landlord, Major Denis Mahon. Failing to pay rent while starving under a national famine, they struck a deal to walk to Dublin in exchange for free passage to Canada – an agreement to undergo \"assisted\" emigration. Many would perish and lose contact with their families for generations to come, gaining them the nickname \"the missing 1,490\".\nThe trail is walkable in a minimum of six days to keep daily mileage feasible and allow time for sightseeing along the way. It is positioned between two poignant attractions: the National Famine Museum and the EPIC Museum of Irish Emigration. While sombre, it's an immense trek of education, connection and heritage. Increasingly hailed as \"Ireland's Camino\", the National Famine Way addresses the role that starvation and forced emigration played in shaping the modern Irish diaspora. It also shows that the missing 1,490 who tackled the walk to Dublin are far more than just a statistic; the trail hopes to reiterate that their memory should not be forgotten.\nThe event occurred during the Irish Famine (An Gorta Mór) that followed a catastrophic potato blight. The impact stretched from 1845 until 1852, damaging 75% of crops andespecially endangering tenant farmers whose primary food source and income came from potatoes.\n\"There was a quarter of the population surviving on potatoes,\" said Caroilin Callery, a prominent figure behind the trail’s creation and the daughter of Jim Callery, who founded the National Famine Museum after finding more than 50,000 local famine documents, including an 1846 petition from starving tenants in Cloonahee begging for assistance. Now a director of the Irish Heritage Trust, she explained: \"An acre of land could give you enough potatoes to survive and have your family survive, and Irish people were known to be eating up to 16lb of potatoes a day.\"\nDuring this time, Ireland lost approximately one million civilians to mass emigration and a million to starvation. All of this occurred under British colonial rule. It's categorised, at the very least, as a colossal organisational failure; a deadly set of circumstances created by continued exportation of alternative food sources like grain to Britain while the Irish population starved.\n\"In or around £10m between 1845 and 1852 was spent by the British government in various kinds of schemes in Ireland and little more than 10 years later there was £64m spent on the Crimean War,\" said Callery, noting the deprioritisation of saving those lower Irish classes.\nOne such scheme was relocating civilians to the New World. This emigration strategy reduced the population in Ireland while reclaiming the indebted rental properties that were no longer profitable for the predominantly Anglo-Irish landlords.\nStrokestown experienced one of the largest assisted emigrations in Ireland. The small town was centred around the privately owned house and grounds of Strokestown Park Estate, where the adjoining National Famine Museum now resides. Mahon inherited the estate in 1845, with the property already saddled with £30,000 in debt and tenant farmers who'd missed payment after payment. By 1847, he'd secured court rights to evict these families, offering three options: homelessness; the workhouse; or assisted emigration to Canada.\nCanada came with a catch, however; the passage would be paid for by Mahon, but the tenants had to walk 165km through unwelcoming terrain, exposed to angered wanderers, thieves, mobs and all elements to reach the ships in Dublin. Already starving and often dragging small children in tow, this was an agonising feat to demand. \nThe National Famine Way not only follows their route, but has a poignant stance in partnering with scholars to trace the original individuals who made the journey. In 2013, Strokestown even welcomed the grandson of Daniel Tighe, a 12-year-old boy who survived the journey on foot and boat, carving out a new life in Canada. The entire town burst into celebration on his descendent's arrival, who'd been discovered by sheer luck through investigations in Canada.\nMy father and hiked the trail in August, and on day one of six, our feet were already starting to throb as we walked 15km from Strokestown to Cloondara, the starting point of the Royal Canal. Just like the original walkers, arriving in Cloondara marked the beginning of our real journey. The canal would have been the most direct route to Dublin in the 19th Century, a rammed chaos of muddled passengers and freight transportation.\nThe initial 32km stretch snaked alongside the waterway from Cloondara to Abbeyshrule. The scenery stayed much the same as we strolled past meadows and counted down the canal's black-and-white-painted locks. Opening the National Famine Way app, I browsed through audio files for each section of the walk, which contained stories on some of those who braved this journey and area-specific historical insights. \n \nI listened to the haunting audio rendition of Daniel Tighe's distress at leaving behind the homely sight of Sliabh Ban, Roscommon's tallest hill. Near Mosstown Harbour, the lilting youth's voice continued with a disturbing tale of crazed, starving dogs fighting over a human corpse they'd pulled from a field. By the time we were an hour outside of Abbeyshrule, the first few blisters were rearing their unwanted heads. I gingerly applied plasters, wondering how the 1847 walkers got by lining their shoes with moss, as I'd earlier learned on the app. \nThere were no hotel rooms available in Mullingar, pushing us out to the next village of Moyvalley and creating a 40km beast of around nine hours rather than the recommended 30.3km. The canal was serene, with wildflowers and bullrushes swaying at eye level, disrupted only by intermittent splatters of rain or a startled heron. The original walkers would have set up camp along these banks. But, following in their footsteps, the scarce hotels were a reminder of the isolation and true scale of the journey. \nThe road surface switched between asphalt and tarmac, with the Mullingar workhouse and famine graveyard providing respite from our trudge. The 1841-built institution, which gave housing and employment to the desperate, is still relatively intact, although its cemetery stands testament to its inefficiency as a safe refuge in its time; a lingering home for the people from the period who didn’t make it. The workhouse complex was ridden with disease due to overcrowding, and it's thought that the graves would have extended far beyond their modern boundaries. \nMore like this:• The Irish city you should visit in 2024• The incredible reinvention of Ireland's 'awful' tourist town• The Irish ingredient born from famine \nMaynooth was our final overnight stay, a bubbly university town with castle ruins and ornate architecture. The final stretch of the trail was the hardest; my feet were so blistered that even hobbling to the shower the night before had felt like a battle. At 05:00, unable to sleep with adrenaline pumping, we set out on an early start. I couldn't tell if it was the exhaustion of walking more than 130km or the sudden dawning of the gravity of the tragedy, but I spent much of it in tears. Rested and fed, it was unfathomable to even begin to process how starving civilians, including children and the elderly, had traversed an identical route, not knowing what their future held.\nFinally emerging at Dublin’s River Liffey, we were beaming. But I couldn't have finished the National Famine Way without my dad. It's the quiet ways that parents selflessly make your life easier. Silently sneaking the heavier bags, offering the last sips of water and getting your order in first when you finally reach somewhere serving food.\nIt was heartbreaking to think of the love that Mary Tighe, Daniel’s widowed mother, would have had for her children. Perhaps she, too, took the heavier bags as they walked and stood aside to prioritise food and water for them. Yet Dublin represented a different kind of finality to her journey, and her 12-year-old son would next touch land in Canada as an orphan, accompanied only by the responsibility of becoming a sole carer to his younger sister.\nThe survival of the transatlantic voyage was a whole new beast aboard the darkly nicknamed \"coffin ships\". These often unseaworthy vessels were used to transport thousands of Irish emigrants across the Atlantic in the famine years. A third of the 1,490 would not see the new life they'd been promised.\n\"We were aware that these people had been very much forgotten,\" Callery said of the 1,490.\" There was a veil of silence over the famine from 1845 right through to the mid-1990s. It was rarely spoken about; it wasn't covered in history in schools.\"\nIt was agonising to me how a trail that was mostly tackled by families resulted in such traumatic fragmentation and loss. But I realised as I walked, the National Famine Way takes a bold yet sensitive approach to preserving what is part of Ireland's darkest history.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

{"doc_id": 19, "question": "What was the name given to the ships used to transport Irish emigrants during the famine years?", "answer": ["Coffin ships"], "doc": "The 165km (103 miles) National Famine Way from Strokestown to Dublin is a harrowing but deeply impactful route that allows modern walkers to follow in the footsteps of the Strokestown tenants.\nStrokestown was a welcome reprieve after our three-hour coach ride from Dublin, predominantly bending through winding country lanes. The small town in Roscommon, Ireland's central bog county, has a \"one-horse\" feel; its popular pub, J Beirne, is accessed through a simply labelled, plain white door in the back of a grocery store. A 2022 census cited a total population of just 850. However, Strokestown is not just a small community in rural Ireland – it's the trailhead for a trek commemorating the most tragic walk in Irish history. \nMy father and I had come here to hike the National Famine Way, a 165km heritage trail that connects Strokestown with the shoreside capital of Dublin. The route, dotted with bronze shoe trail markers, was launched in 2020 to commemorate 1,490 Strokestown residents who made this same journey on foot in 1847 after being forced out by their Anglo-Irish landlord, Major Denis Mahon. Failing to pay rent while starving under a national famine, they struck a deal to walk to Dublin in exchange for free passage to Canada – an agreement to undergo \"assisted\" emigration. Many would perish and lose contact with their families for generations to come, gaining them the nickname \"the missing 1,490\".\nThe trail is walkable in a minimum of six days to keep daily mileage feasible and allow time for sightseeing along the way. It is positioned between two poignant attractions: the National Famine Museum and the EPIC Museum of Irish Emigration. While sombre, it's an immense trek of education, connection and heritage. Increasingly hailed as \"Ireland's Camino\", the National Famine Way addresses the role that starvation and forced emigration played in shaping the modern Irish diaspora. It also shows that the missing 1,490 who tackled the walk to Dublin are far more than just a statistic; the trail hopes to reiterate that their memory should not be forgotten.\nThe event occurred during the Irish Famine (An Gorta Mór) that followed a catastrophic potato blight. The impact stretched from 1845 until 1852, damaging 75% of crops andespecially endangering tenant farmers whose primary food source and income came from potatoes.\n\"There was a quarter of the population surviving on potatoes,\" said Caroilin Callery, a prominent figure behind the trail’s creation and the daughter of Jim Callery, who founded the National Famine Museum after finding more than 50,000 local famine documents, including an 1846 petition from starving tenants in Cloonahee begging for assistance. Now a director of the Irish Heritage Trust, she explained: \"An acre of land could give you enough potatoes to survive and have your family survive, and Irish people were known to be eating up to 16lb of potatoes a day.\"\nDuring this time, Ireland lost approximately one million civilians to mass emigration and a million to starvation. All of this occurred under British colonial rule. It's categorised, at the very least, as a colossal organisational failure; a deadly set of circumstances created by continued exportation of alternative food sources like grain to Britain while the Irish population starved.\n\"In or around £10m between 1845 and 1852 was spent by the British government in various kinds of schemes in Ireland and little more than 10 years later there was £64m spent on the Crimean War,\" said Callery, noting the deprioritisation of saving those lower Irish classes.\nOne such scheme was relocating civilians to the New World. This emigration strategy reduced the population in Ireland while reclaiming the indebted rental properties that were no longer profitable for the predominantly Anglo-Irish landlords.\nStrokestown experienced one of the largest assisted emigrations in Ireland. The small town was centred around the privately owned house and grounds of Strokestown Park Estate, where the adjoining National Famine Museum now resides. Mahon inherited the estate in 1845, with the property already saddled with £30,000 in debt and tenant farmers who'd missed payment after payment. By 1847, he'd secured court rights to evict these families, offering three options: homelessness; the workhouse; or assisted emigration to Canada.\nCanada came with a catch, however; the passage would be paid for by Mahon, but the tenants had to walk 165km through unwelcoming terrain, exposed to angered wanderers, thieves, mobs and all elements to reach the ships in Dublin.

Earthships sell for anything from around $500,000 to $900,000 (£376,000 to £677,000) and are also available for overnight stays in and near Taos for around $240 (£180) per night.\nThe Earthship movement began in Taos in the 1970s after Kentucky native Michael Reynolds, founder of eco-construction company Earthship Biotecture, moved here in 1969 with an architecture degree.

I was seeing all these beer cans tossed away and I'm saying, 'why don't we build out of beer cans and not trees?'\"\nReynolds built his beer-can house in 1971, gaining small notice in the news for its quirkiness. Yet, it went on to be exhibited in various parts of the world, including the Louvre Museum in Paris, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Reynolds notes, with some incredulity, \"MoMA just bought a beer can brick for $4,500 (£3,386).\" Indeed, after using one of the building blocks made of beer cans in an exhibit, the museum decided to add one to its permanent collection.\nStill, for years he was largely looked at as a kook at best, and not a serious architect. \n\"It was a kind of a pie-in-the-sky ridiculous idea, but I went ahead and started going in that direction,\" Reynolds says. \"I started using bottles and I started using tyres, and I kept going.

The especially fatty milk they produce makes for extra flavourful cheeses.\"\nIndeed, Kars' main street was lined with mandira (cheese shops) where tour groups (almost exclusively Turkish) were busy tasting and buying the local specialties, which include the Kars Kashar – an aged cheese made with cow and sheep's milk – and my personal favourite, Kars Gravyer, a local hard cheese named after Swiss Gruyere that's actually more akin in flavour to Emmental.\nI lost count of the number of cheese mongers I passed on the way to Kars Peyniri Muzesi (Kars Cheese Museum), where replica wheels of Kars Gravyer framed an entranceway leading into a cold concrete fortress built in 1734 to defend Ottoman Kars against the expanding Russian Empire. \"When the Russians annexed Kars in 1878, they used this stronghold to store cheese,\" said museum \"storyteller\" and guide, Birol Aydin.\n\"Eight thousand years ago, people were making cheese on the Euphrates,\" he added, noting that Turkey's cheesemaking traditions date back to antiquity. \"When the Turkish people were nomads in Central Asia, they were making cheese, and we have written references to Anatolian cheese as far back as the 12th Century CE.\"\nWhen the Russians, who occupied much of what's now Eastern Turkey from 1878 until 1918, exiled a religious spiritualist group named the Molokans to the region, they inadvertently gifted Kars with the modern cheesemaking traditions found here today. Molokan means \"milk drinkers\" and adherents to the sect were reviled in Russia for consuming dairy products during fasts like Lent when Orthodox Christians abstained.\nKars sits at an altitude of 1,756m (5,761ft), and Molokan dairy farms thrived in a cold, unforgiving climate where animal husbandry was the only way to survive the long winters. Aydin explained how the Molokans brought new types of cheese to eastern Turkey, and in the late 19th Century, Russians built the first modern cheese factory in Kars.\nIn 1878, a visiting Swiss cheesemaker named David Moser found ripe conditions for Swiss cheese production, and he introduced the techniques and recipes still used to produce Kars Gravyer, now one of the most famous cheeses in Turkey. Professor Fügen Durlu-Özkaya, from the faculty of tourism, gastronomy and culinary arts at Ankara Hacı Bayram Veli University, later explained how Kars Gravyer's appeal stems largely from its unique, local production methods that have remained faithful to their mixed 19th-Century Molokan-Swiss roots.\n\"Local cheesemakers use original production methods. Staying true to its essence affects its taste, which helps with its popularity,\" she said. \"The use of copper cauldrons in production, the use of original wooden shovels and the meticulous use of traditional methods in the ageing and ripening stages of the cheese are the elements that make it so special and delicious.\"\nThe next day I had the chance to see these authentic production methods in action when I visited the cheesemaking village of Boğatepe, a half-hour drive through snow-draped landscapes from the city. Boğatepe is one of the original Molokan villages founded in the 19th Century, and while most Molokans returned to Russia after World War One or integrated into modern Turkey (I'm told there's only one old man left in the village who calls himself a Molokan), their recipes have been preserved by successive generations of Turkish cheesemakers.\nBoğatepe has a reputation for making some of the best cheese in Turkey, and almost all the cheese sold in the mandira down in Kars is produced in small, family-run factories here. The Koçulus are one of Boğatepe's cheesemaking families, and I joined Çağdaş Koçulu – who styles himself as \"The Master of Cheese\" and has studied cheese production in Kars, Switzerland and Germany – for a grand tour of their factory. Milk was being boiled in Molokan copper pots that Koçuluclaimed are 150 years old, while wheels of Kars Gravyer ripened in cold cellars below the factory floor.\nKars Gravyer requires a particular quality of cow's milk that's determined by what grasses and plants the cows have eaten, and as such, Kars Gravyer is only produced in spring and summer.  I was visiting in January when less milk is available, so production was focused on a type of cheese they described as \"fresh yellow cheese\", which is an un-aged version of Kars Kashar.\n\"The difference in the seasons affects the texture and taste of the cheese,\" Koçulu explained, as he whipped out a penknife and sliced me off a few tasters of fresh, unripened Kashar they'd started preparing earlier that day. \"Fresh yellow cheese is sweeter, more sugary than Kars Gravyer, which is saltier and sourer.\"\nRipening time is just as important as the quality of milk, and Kars Gravyer is aged for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of four years. Fresh yellow cheese has a much shorter maturation time and can be ready in a few weeks or months, but when it's ripened in hessian sacks, it can then be sold as \"Aged Kars Kashar\" (or \"Old Yellow Cheese\", as Koçulu described it).\nMore like this:• The Turkish city that lives for breakfast• Italy’s practically perfect food• The Spanish cheese nearing extinction\nBoğatepe cheesemakers produce as many as 32 distinct cheese types, and they're constantly developing or \"discovering\" new ones. \"You cannot find this one in the supermarkets in Istanbul,\" Koçulu said, showing me what he called \"Caucasian Shepherd's Cheese\". \"This was a lost, forgotten cheese, but we rediscovered the recipe and started producing it again. No one else is making this type of cheese.\"\nHe took me around Boğatepe's small cheese museum, which tells the same story but is more rustic than the modern one in Kars, before we sat down in the dining room above his family's cheese shop for the \"Cheesemaker's Breakfast\" that they offer to visitors.\nAs she laid out five or six cheeses on the wooden table, Koçulu's mother, Nigar, explained how tourists make the short journey from Kars just for breakfast. They typically stop by on their way to other popular nearby sights in the region, like Lake Cildir, a vast freshwater lake that's frozen in winter, and Ani, where you can visit the 11th-Century ruins of an Armenian kingdom's former capital. As she poured endless cups of hot tea, Nigar also explained how cheesemaking saved Boğatepe.\n\"In 2000, there was a very sad traffic accident. Seventeen people from the village were killed,\" she said, stopping me in my tracks, mid-bite. \"Many of the villagers intended to migrate to the cities, to escape the memories.\"\nAt the time of the disaster, Boğatepe's cheese industry was stagnating, providing further reason to leave. Nigar's brother, Ilhan Koçulu, rose to the challenge and convinced many would-be emigrants to stay as he secured funding from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). He launched a marketing campaign that reintroduced local cheeses like Kars Gravyer to cheese lovers across Turkey, which encouraged a surge in culinary tourists to Kars. \nAssisted by UNDP funding, Ilhan, Nigar and another Boğatepe local, Zümran Ömür, also founded a women's co-operative, which provides a point of contact for visitors, trains local women in the nuances of the tourism industry and allows them to distribute bookings across homestays in the village. This means the cheesemakers can focus on their craft, keeping the mandira in Kars stocked with Kashar and Gravyer, as the cooperative deals with the tourism business in Boğatepe.\n\"The cooperative is for our kids,\" Nigar said, outlining her hope that Boğatepe's cheese-making traditions will survive well into the future. \"It can help us to stay here and prevent the next generation from leaving for the bigger cities. Just look at my son. He stayed here and studied cheesemaking and now he's become a successful businessman in the village.\"\nGiven the increasing popularity of the Eastern Express – which terminates in Kars and can sell out in seconds in the winter season – the city's profile is certain to grow further in the future, opening new markets and inspiring more tourists to visit cheesemaking families like the Koçulus.\nBy the time I head back to Kars later that day I feel as if I've eaten a kilo of cheese, but that same evening, I'm consuming yet more of it as I watch Caucasus-style dancing in a restaurant named Pushkin. I willingly order yet another platter of local delicacies, including more Kars Gravyer, Tulum (a soft goat’s cheese, ripened in goatskin) and fresh, mellow Kashar. As Turkey’s east opens up to tourism, now’s the time for cheese lovers to make the pilgrimage to Kars, the country’s cheesy capital.\n --\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

{"doc_id": 22, "question": "What is the name of the chef who shares his top recommendations for street food in Kolkata?", "answer": ["Auroni Mookerjee"], "doc": "From hole-in-the-wall chow mein joints to neighbourhood phuchka stalls, chef Auroni Mookerjee shares his top recommendations for street food in his hometown.\nOnce the political seat of the British East India Company, today Kolkata is a bustling metropolis that thrives on street food. Be it hot-off-the-wok kochuris (deep-fried breads served with potato curry), or phuckha (spicy stuffed crisp spheres), any visitor will be spoiled for choice.\n\"Kolkata is one of those cities where the chefs on the street almost always outcook the chefs in the brick-and-mortar kitchen,\" says Auroni Mookerjee, a chef and Kolkata native best known for his modern interpretations of Bengali food. \"What's also rare is that there's something for everyone and at any price point.\"\nKolkatans take utmost pride in their culinary heritage that borrows from a buffet of cultures — the Mughals, Portuguese, British, Chinese, Armenians and Jewish settlers. Bengali cuisine as a whole is characterised by the subtle use of spices with a focus on seasonal eating and a zero-waste cooking approach.\n\"People here pride themselves on having daily eating rituals,\" explains Mookerjee. \"The evening jolkhabar (light evening snack) is more of a culture… and is eaten on the way back from work. Sometimes you even pack some to share with everyone at home.\"\nThe snacking action peaks in October during Durga Puja, the 10-day autumn festival that celebrates the victory of Durga – Kolkata's favourite goddess – over the demon king Mahishasura. Though celebrated throughout India, Kolkata's Durga Puja festival remains the country's most spectacular, making the Unesco Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2021. The streets are taken over by vibrant processions, but stalls selling phuchka, kochuris, kathi rolls and cutlets remain the main attraction at makeshift temples called pandals that are erected across the city.\nTo get a true flavour of Kolkata's iconic street eats, Mookerjee says that travellers should head into the city's many lanes, where local vendors have been serving delicious, unpretentious food for decades. And be prepared to queue – patiently.\nHere are Mookerjee's top street foods in Kolkata.\nPhuchka, crisp, hollow wholewheat flour and semolina orbs filled with spiced potatoes and chickpeas then dunked in tangy tamarind water right before you devour them in one large bite, is India's favourite street snack – and a Kolkata staple.\n\"It's rare to come across a bad phuchka,\" says Mookerjee, whose favourite phuchka seller is Dilip da (da is a term of endearment for elder brother) in South Kolkata. \"Every street corner has its own vendor,\" says Mookerjee. \"And whether you are in the north or south of the city, the offerings might change a little. Some will give you a slightly sweetish water, the others a bit spicy and sour. That's why I love Dilip da, because he gives you the best of both.\"\nDilip da has been selling phuchka for four decades and makes the shells from scratch (more than 1,000 daily). He uses an assortment of home-made masalas in the fillings and flavours the water with aromatic gondhoraj limes. His street cart is easy to spot, mainly because of the photos of celebrity chefs and movie stars on it. \"The joy he takes in making the phuchka and educating you about his craft is probably why he is most famous,\" says Mookerjee.

{"doc_id": 22, "question": "Which street food vendor is known for making the best phuchka in South Kolkata?", "answer": ["Dilip da"], "doc": "From hole-in-the-wall chow mein joints to neighbourhood phuchka stalls, chef Auroni Mookerjee shares his top recommendations for street food in his hometown.\nOnce the political seat of the British East India Company, today Kolkata is a bustling metropolis that thrives on street food. Be it hot-off-the-wok kochuris (deep-fried breads served with potato curry), or phuckha (spicy stuffed crisp spheres), any visitor will be spoiled for choice.\n\"Kolkata is one of those cities where the chefs on the street almost always outcook the chefs in the brick-and-mortar kitchen,\" says Auroni Mookerjee, a chef and Kolkata native best known for his modern interpretations of Bengali food. \"What's also rare is that there's something for everyone and at any price point.\"\nKolkatans take utmost pride in their culinary heritage that borrows from a buffet of cultures — the Mughals, Portuguese, British, Chinese, Armenians and Jewish settlers. Bengali cuisine as a whole is characterised by the subtle use of spices with a focus on seasonal eating and a zero-waste cooking approach.\n\"People here pride themselves on having daily eating rituals,\" explains Mookerjee. \"The evening jolkhabar (light evening snack) is more of a culture… and is eaten on the way back from work. Sometimes you even pack some to share with everyone at home.\"\nThe snacking action peaks in October during Durga Puja, the 10-day autumn festival that celebrates the victory of Durga – Kolkata's favourite goddess – over the demon king Mahishasura. Though celebrated throughout India, Kolkata's Durga Puja festival remains the country's most spectacular, making the Unesco Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2021. The streets are taken over by vibrant processions, but stalls selling phuchka, kochuris, kathi rolls and cutlets remain the main attraction at makeshift temples called pandals that are erected across the city.\nTo get a true flavour of Kolkata's iconic street eats, Mookerjee says that travellers should head into the city's many lanes, where local vendors have been serving delicious, unpretentious food for decades. And be prepared to queue – patiently.\nHere are Mookerjee's top street foods in Kolkata.\nPhuchka, crisp, hollow wholewheat flour and semolina orbs filled with spiced potatoes and chickpeas then dunked in tangy tamarind water right before you devour them in one large bite, is India's favourite street snack – and a Kolkata staple.\n\"It's rare to come across a bad phuchka,\" says Mookerjee, whose favourite phuchka seller is Dilip da (da is a term of endearment for elder brother) in South Kolkata. \"Every street corner has its own vendor,\" says Mookerjee. \"And whether you are in the north or south of the city, the offerings might change a little. Some will give you a slightly sweetish water, the others a bit spicy and sour. That's why I love Dilip da, because he gives you the best of both.\"\nDilip da has been selling phuchka for four decades and makes the shells from scratch (more than 1,000 daily). He uses an assortment of home-made masalas in the fillings and flavours the water with aromatic gondhoraj limes. His street cart is easy to spot, mainly because of the photos of celebrity chefs and movie stars on it. \"The joy he takes in making the phuchka and educating you about his craft is probably why he is most famous,\" says Mookerjee.

{"doc_id": 23, "question": "When is World Animal Day celebrated?", "answer": ["4 October"], "doc": "From a horseback safari in Brazil to one of the marine world's most flamboyant sex shows, these wildlife encounters allow travellers to come face to face with animals – without getting too close.\nFor nearly a century, people around the globe have celebrated World Animal Day. Launched in 1925, the annual event on 4 October is designed to raise awareness of animal rights issues and help improve the treatment and wellbeing of wildlife. Today, the international effort includes more than 90 ambassadors in 70 countries, and in recent decades, travel has increasingly played a pivotal role in wildlife conservation.\nFrom the grassy plains of the African savanna to the depths of South Australia's oceans, people have long sought to come face to face with some of the planet's most remarkable creatures. But in many places, unregulated development and climate change are a growing risk to these animals' continued existence. In fact, according to a UN Report, more than one million plant and animal species are now threatened with extinction.\nAnother issue that seems to be on the rise is careless encounters with humans. The last few years have been filled with tales of tourists interacting with wildlife in ways that are both dangerous for them and for the animals in question. But for every reckless animal interaction we read about, there are now countless guides, local guardians and responsible eco-tourism companies showing people how they can experience respectful wildlife encounters while also contributing to their conservation.\nFrom whale-watching in Mexico to lemur-spotting in Malaysia, here are some of the most remarkable wildlife experiences around the globe where rule-abiding travellers are welcome.\nEvery year from May to September, hundreds of thousands of Giant Australian cuttlefish gather in South Australia's Upper Spencer Marine Gulf Park in one of the animal world's most flamboyant sex shows. Closely related to the octopus, these whip-smart molluscs can change colour and texture instantly, and when they mate, the animals are known to pulsate hues and males disguise themselves as females. Nowhere else on Earth can swimmers observe such spectacular and strange mating behaviours en masse as here in Whyalla, and local outfitters offer responsibly guided trips to see them. Learn more here.\nIn El Vizcaino, a protected whale sanctuary in Mexico's Baja California Sur peninsula, grey whales are known to regularly and voluntarily approach fishing boats out of sheer curiosity, sparking new whale-watching tours where the whales are the ones doing the viewing. These unique interactions are helping to fuel conservation and protection of their habitat, as well as providing a safe way for visitors to interact with these majestic gentle giants. Learn more here.\nFound in tiny \"herds\" on a specific type of algae, these miniature sea slugs are named for their fuzzy appearance and black-tipped antennae that resemble sheep's ears. The unique creatures are some of the only animals that can photosynthesise, using chloroplasts from the algae they eat and store in their tissues to grow. The delicate 8mm-long creatures are facing threats from climate change, habitat loss and destructive fishing practices, but divers in marine-protected areas like Maricaban Island in Batangas can still safely spot them in the wild – especially when accompanied by local guides. Learn more here.\nIn spring and autumn, as the sun sets over Denmark's Wadden Sea National Park, a spectacular aerial show takes place. More than 1.5 million starlings take to the air, swooping around in a wave-like synchronised dance, called a murmuration. Though the birds and their dance can be seen in various locations all over the world, the coastal wetlands in southern Denmark is one of the most dramatic places to witness this mesmerising – if somewhat mysterious – natural phenomenon. Learn more here.\nFor many years, the paddling and steering of traditional mokoro canoes used to take visitors to view wildlife in the Okavango Delta were strictly the purview of men. However, recently a number of female mokoro guides (called \"polers\") have started to take up the tradition, leading visitors in search of the elephants, zebras and buffalos who call the Delta's glassy waters home. This change is part of a larger trend across the continent to empower women to participate in eco-friendly safari tourism. Learn more here.\nThe Pantanal stretches more than 140,000 sq km across Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay and is considered the largest wetland on Earth. The northern corner of the Brazilian Pantanal is home to one of the world's most unique safaris. Here, travellers hop aboard Pantaneiro horses as they navigate the wetland marsh, allowing them to keep their eyes peeled for jaguars, giant anteaters, giant otters, tapir, maned wolves and hundreds of bird species of birds. Learn more here.\nMore like this: • The best travel photographs from around the world • Thirteen photos that will make you care about the ocean • Photographing one of the most remote places on Earth\nThough closely related to monkeys, the so-called \"flying lemur\" is actually a Malayan colugo and is neither a monkey nor a lemur. Instead, it's a unique species found only in forests across South-East Asia. Despite being fairly widespread, very little is known about the large-eyed gliding creature. Nature focused tours like Jungle Walla offer the best opportunities to see them in the wild. Learn more here.\nNearly wiped out in the early 1900s, Ireland's native grey seal population, which experienced a comeback due to federal protection laws passed in 1976, are now in danger again. Climate change is affecting their food supply and increasing storms are separating seal pups from their parents before they're fully independent. For the last 10 years, an organisation called Seal Rescue Ireland has been doing their best to rescue orphaned or injured seals found across the island country. Touring their facility allows visitors to meet some of the rescued pups and learn about their rehabilitation process. Learn more here.\nIf you look into the folded leaves of heliconia plants in Braulio Carrillo National Park, you might come face to face with some of the country's cutest (and most endangered) flying mammals. Honduran white bats, also called the Caribbean tent-making bats, which most closely resemble tiny cotton balls with bright orange noses and ears, were once found across Central America. Now one of the smallest fruit-eating bat species in the world is struggling to survive. Visit Tirimbina Rainforest Center to see the bats in the wild and help contribute to the area's conservation efforts. Learn more here.\nConsidered by the Aztecs to be a representation of Xolotl, god of the underworld, axolotls are a paedomorphic salamander species found in the canals and waterways of Mexico City that appear to be wearing a perpetual grin. Scientists are particularly interested in the species because of its ability to regenerate limbs, eyes and even organs. However, it's a race against time as the native habitat of the tiny amphibians increasingly disappears or is polluted by development. Because axolotls are so endangered, the best place to catch a glimpse of them is in places like the Chapultepec Zoo and the Zoológico Los Coyotes.

{"doc_id": 24, "question": "What is the name of the urban winery that transports grapes from Austria to Finland to make natural wines?", "answer": ["Noita"], "doc": "Considered the gateway to the world's largest archipelago and renowned for its food scene, Finland's second city is well worth a detour.\nNordic destinations Stockholm and Copenhagen lure millions of visitors a year, many attracted by the cities' upscale design, elevated food scenes and compelling histories. Yet, Finland's first capital and oldest city, Turku, founded in 1229 along the banks of the River Aura, hits the same high notes as its neighbours, but without the crowds.\nWhat's more, this 200,000-person city on Finland's south-west coast is also known as the gateway to the Finnish archipelago: a 40,000-island labyrinth that's considered the largest in the world.\nKnown as Åbo to its predominantly Swedish-speaking inhabitants (a name which aptly means \"living by the river\"), Turku was once part of Sweden in the Middle Ages before becoming an autonomous Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire in 1809. Since Finland gained independence in 1917, the cosmopolitan hub has served as Finland's second city, and thanks to its thriving food and cafe scene and its Seine-like river vibe, the city is sometimes called \"the Paris of Finland\".\nTree-lined boulevards flanked by 19th-Century theatres, coffee shops and market halls – many with a sustainable throughline – fill Turku's compact and walkable centre. I spent an hour flipping through new and used CDs and vinyl at the three-storey 8raita Record Store and shopped for vintage kimonos and theatre costumes, jewellery and dresses at Boutique Minne in the town centre. Nonprofit, cooperative book cafe Turku Kirjakahvila offers literature from Finnish and foreign publishing houses, self-published books and house-baked vegan pastries; Televisio Lifestyle Store sells a multi-chromatic clash of clothes, jewellery, shoes, bags, and gifts from the store's eponymous label and Finnish and Nordic brands Katri Niskanen, Gauhar, Papu Design and NOT.\nSadly, 70% of the city's buildings burned down during the 1827 Great Fire of Turku, but you can see glimpses of the city's distant past at the Museum of Archaeology and Contemporary Art, where the remains of Turku's former medieval city quarter, Aboa Vetus, were discovered following archaeological excavations and are now displayed.\nAbove ground, the 13th-Century granite-and-stone Turku Castle stood guard over the Aura until it was reimagined as a Finnish history museum in 1993. Elsewhere, The Kakolanmäki Hill Museum showcases more recent developments, including the history of Kakola Prison, which was established in 1863 and housed some of the country's most notorious villains and murderers until in 2007. Since then, Kakolanmäki, (\"Kakola's hill\"), has been revitalised. You can opt to stay at the prison's former psychiatric hospital, Forenom apartments, which now offer modern accommodations with a Nordic-chic wood-and-textile aesthetic, or Hotel Kakola, whose upscale rooms are located in the city's former prison (the narrow cell room with simple bunk beds and barred windows is the most requested).\nFrom the hotel, a pleasant stroll north-east along the river's north bank takes you to Turku's granite Art Museum, whose 7,600 works span the \"golden age\" of Finnish art, Finnish Surrealism and pop art at the turn of the 20th Century. A short walk away, Café Art is a seven-time recipient of the national Barista of the Year – a highly anticipated competition, since the Finns rank among the world's biggest coffee drinkers.\nIn the summer, outdoor concerts are held almost daily outside the Turku Cathedral, with plenty of vendors selling locally sourced food and wine. When Finland joined the EU in 1995, its ministers had to decide whether Finland was a Nordic country that received heating subsidies or a wine-producing nation, like France and Italy, which received different grants. Finland's government opted to keep its citizens warm; today, Finland must label homegrown grape wine as \"mild alcoholic beverage fermented from grapes\", prompting entrepreneurs to explore boozy expressions of lingonberries, cloudberries and sea buckthorn, which are slowly garnering attention from international sommeliers.\nIf you fancy a more familiar wine, you'll find that, too. I spent an enjoyable hour supine in a deck chair, chatting with the vintners from urban winery Noita who are skirting the rules by hand-picking organic grapes from Burgenland, Austria, and transporting them to their facility in Finland's Fiskars Village, 112km to the south-east, to make delicious natural Riesling, Grüner Veltliner and other blends.\nThe city's food scene has been attracting international attention lately, too. After tasting-menu restaurant Kaskis earned Turku's first Michelin star in 2022 (Finland's first outside Helsinki), Michelin chose to launch its 2023 Nordic Countries Guide in Turku, highlighting the region's local food culture. In Kaskis's intimate and unassuming space on the ground floor of an apartment building, chefs and founders Simo Raisio and Erik Mansikka pair pristine perch and pike with celery and ingredients foraged sustainably in nearby forests, served on an eclectic mix of recycled plates and Mansikka's hand-made ceramics. Mansikka is something of a posterchild for the ambitions of Turku's dynamic food scene: as I wandered around town, his red Michelin star clavicle tattoo and impish grin decorated displays of pots and pans at kitchen stores all over.\nHe's also a familiar sight at Turku Market Hall, where vendors supply home cooks and top-notch restaurants alike with fresh produce and products. I planned to wander the market's 19th-Century red-brick halls before finding a restaurant for lunch, but instead, the smells emanating from shop-cum-lunch counter Herkkunuotta lured me to pull up a counter chair. Upbeat chef-fishmonger Johan Hellsten and his team develop catch-of-the-day dishes on the fly between wrapping packets of spotted crab and giant shrimp. That day, offerings included perch soup seasoned liberally with fragrant dill, cold-smoked and cured local rainbow trout, and reindeer two-ways: a mousse-filled tartlet, and cold-smoked and sliced with horseradish.\nTurku is renowned for the quality of its local, seasonal ingredients, many of which are farmed or harvested on its nearby islands. In fact, the many thousands of islands and islets encompassing the Finnish archipelago (sometimes called the Turku archipelago) include autonomous municipalities that invite you to choose your own adventure – culinary or otherwise.\nOne of the closest is Ruissalo, part of Turku city (accessible via bus #8 from the city centre) and a former hunting island for Turku Castle's court. One of my favourite ways to spend a Sunday is a massage at Ruissalo Spa before alternating between chilly sea water plunges and mad dashes back to the balmy warmth of the sauna.\nMore like this: • Maakalla: Europe's isolated, autonomous island • The secret meaning behind the World Tree Hugging Championships • The Swedish law of wanderlust\nFrom Turku, Finland's many islands fan west along the Baltic Sea between the Gulf of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland and Åland, an autonomous group of more than 6,500 islands within Finnish territorial waters – only 60 of which are inhabited. Thanks to the city's airport, its twice-daily ferry departures to the region and frequent boat tours of the archipelago, Finland's second city is considered the best gateway to these far-flung isles.\nDespite its lofty latitude, Åland is often sunnier than the mainland. As spring arrives, the region comes alive as 1.5 million visitors swell its inhabited islands through the summer months, most bound for Åland's capital, Mariehamn (Marie's Harbour), which was established by Russia's Czar Alexander II in 1861 and named for his wife. There's plenty to do (I spent my days wandering the ruins of the Czar's granite fortress and exploring glorious parks and museums) and plenty to eat and drink tucked away within the Torggatan pedestrian precinct's red-and-yellow wooden houses.\nÅland is at its most buzzy during its famed three-day Harvest Festival (typically held in September or October), when local farms and cellars open their doors. I stocked up on local prize-winning butter and cheeses; fruit pies filled with local apples, plums and pears; and Venezuelan transplant Mercedes Winquist's chocolate-enrobed berry confections.\nFinland's Everyman's Right gives Finns and visitors alike the freedom to temporarily stay and camp out overnight anywhere – even in public parks and on private property, so long as you don't cause damage or disturb the landowner. The archipelago is also accessible by year-round ferry service from Turku. Winter attracts those who enjoy cross-country skiing, ice-fishing and skating, post-sauna dips in the freezing Baltic or white-knuckling it to drive point-to-point over the frozen ocean when conditions permit.\nBut visiting from spring to early autumn has always been more my speed, when warmer weather signals the opening of The Archipelago Trail: a 250km \"ring road\" connected by a network of huge, free-to-ride electric yellow ferries that glide noiselessly between islands and invite leisurely exploration.\nOn a recent trip, my favourite sojourn was an afternoon spent at Hotel Hyppeis, a renovated village schoolhouse on Houtskär island (roughly three hours by car and ferry from Turku) where co-owners Sam and Outi Fagerlundin host overnight guests in simple rooms decorated with vintage furnishings and rugs woven from upcycled bed linens and towels.

Elsewhere, The Kakolanmäki Hill Museum showcases more recent developments, including the history of Kakola Prison, which was established in 1863 and housed some of the country's most notorious villains and murderers until in 2007. Since then, Kakolanmäki, (\"Kakola's hill\"), has been revitalised. You can opt to stay at the prison's former psychiatric hospital, Forenom apartments, which now offer modern accommodations with a Nordic-chic wood-and-textile aesthetic, or Hotel Kakola, whose upscale rooms are located in the city's former prison (the narrow cell room with simple bunk beds and barred windows is the most requested).\nFrom the hotel, a pleasant stroll north-east along the river's north bank takes you to Turku's granite Art Museum, whose 7,600 works span the \"golden age\" of Finnish art, Finnish Surrealism and pop art at the turn of the 20th Century. A short walk away, Café Art is a seven-time recipient of the national Barista of the Year – a highly anticipated competition, since the Finns rank among the world's biggest coffee drinkers.\nIn the summer, outdoor concerts are held almost daily outside the Turku Cathedral, with plenty of vendors selling locally sourced food and wine. When Finland joined the EU in 1995, its ministers had to decide whether Finland was a Nordic country that received heating subsidies or a wine-producing nation, like France and Italy, which received different grants. Finland's government opted to keep its citizens warm; today, Finland must label homegrown grape wine as \"mild alcoholic beverage fermented from grapes\", prompting entrepreneurs to explore boozy expressions of lingonberries, cloudberries and sea buckthorn, which are slowly garnering attention from international sommeliers.\nIf you fancy a more familiar wine, you'll find that, too. I spent an enjoyable hour supine in a deck chair, chatting with the vintners from urban winery Noita who are skirting the rules by hand-picking organic grapes from Burgenland, Austria, and transporting them to their facility in Finland's Fiskars Village, 112km to the south-east, to make delicious natural Riesling, Grüner Veltliner and other blends.\nThe city's food scene has been attracting international attention lately, too. After tasting-menu restaurant Kaskis earned Turku's first Michelin star in 2022 (Finland's first outside Helsinki), Michelin chose to launch its 2023 Nordic Countries Guide in Turku, highlighting the region's local food culture. In Kaskis's intimate and unassuming space on the ground floor of an apartment building, chefs and founders Simo Raisio and Erik Mansikka pair pristine perch and pike with celery and ingredients foraged sustainably in nearby forests, served on an eclectic mix of recycled plates and Mansikka's hand-made ceramics. Mansikka is something of a posterchild for the ambitions of Turku's dynamic food scene: as I wandered around town, his red Michelin star clavicle tattoo and impish grin decorated displays of pots and pans at kitchen stores all over.\nHe's also a familiar sight at Turku Market Hall, where vendors supply home cooks and top-notch restaurants alike with fresh produce and products. I planned to wander the market's 19th-Century red-brick halls before finding a restaurant for lunch, but instead, the smells emanating from shop-cum-lunch counter Herkkunuotta lured me to pull up a counter chair. Upbeat chef-fishmonger Johan Hellsten and his team develop catch-of-the-day dishes on the fly between wrapping packets of spotted crab and giant shrimp. That day, offerings included perch soup seasoned liberally with fragrant dill, cold-smoked and cured local rainbow trout, and reindeer two-ways: a mousse-filled tartlet, and cold-smoked and sliced with horseradish.\nTurku is renowned for the quality of its local, seasonal ingredients, many of which are farmed or harvested on its nearby islands. In fact, the many thousands of islands and islets encompassing the Finnish archipelago (sometimes called the Turku archipelago) include autonomous municipalities that invite you to choose your own adventure – culinary or otherwise.\nOne of the closest is Ruissalo, part of Turku city (accessible via bus #8 from the city centre) and a former hunting island for Turku Castle's court. One of my favourite ways to spend a Sunday is a massage at Ruissalo Spa before alternating between chilly sea water plunges and mad dashes back to the balmy warmth of the sauna.\nMore like this: • Maakalla: Europe's isolated, autonomous island • The secret meaning behind the World Tree Hugging Championships • The Swedish law of wanderlust\nFrom Turku, Finland's many islands fan west along the Baltic Sea between the Gulf of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland and Åland, an autonomous group of more than 6,500 islands within Finnish territorial waters – only 60 of which are inhabited. Thanks to the city's airport, its twice-daily ferry departures to the region and frequent boat tours of the archipelago, Finland's second city is considered the best gateway to these far-flung isles.\nDespite its lofty latitude, Åland is often sunnier than the mainland. As spring arrives, the region comes alive as 1.5 million visitors swell its inhabited islands through the summer months, most bound for Åland's capital, Mariehamn (Marie's Harbour), which was established by Russia's Czar Alexander II in 1861 and named for his wife. There's plenty to do (I spent my days wandering the ruins of the Czar's granite fortress and exploring glorious parks and museums) and plenty to eat and drink tucked away within the Torggatan pedestrian precinct's red-and-yellow wooden houses.\nÅland is at its most buzzy during its famed three-day Harvest Festival (typically held in September or October), when local farms and cellars open their doors. I stocked up on local prize-winning butter and cheeses; fruit pies filled with local apples, plums and pears; and Venezuelan transplant Mercedes Winquist's chocolate-enrobed berry confections.\nFinland's Everyman's Right gives Finns and visitors alike the freedom to temporarily stay and camp out overnight anywhere – even in public parks and on private property, so long as you don't cause damage or disturb the landowner. The archipelago is also accessible by year-round ferry service from Turku. Winter attracts those who enjoy cross-country skiing, ice-fishing and skating, post-sauna dips in the freezing Baltic or white-knuckling it to drive point-to-point over the frozen ocean when conditions permit.\nBut visiting from spring to early autumn has always been more my speed, when warmer weather signals the opening of The Archipelago Trail: a 250km \"ring road\" connected by a network of huge, free-to-ride electric yellow ferries that glide noiselessly between islands and invite leisurely exploration.\nOn a recent trip, my favourite sojourn was an afternoon spent at Hotel Hyppeis, a renovated village schoolhouse on Houtskär island (roughly three hours by car and ferry from Turku) where co-owners Sam and Outi Fagerlundin host overnight guests in simple rooms decorated with vintage furnishings and rugs woven from upcycled bed linens and towels.

{"doc_id": 25, "question": "What is the name of the square in Nova Gorica that was cut in two by the border until 2004?", "answer": ["Trg Evrope"], "doc": "Singer-songwriter Tish grew up on the border of Europe's first-ever borderless Capital of Culture. Here are her picks, from underground jams at Mostovna to Fabrika's famous burgers.\nNova Gorica is one of Slovenia's (and Europe's) youngest cities, but it's grown up fast. Since Slovenia's entry into the EU in 2004, it's become a showpiece for Slovenia's rich artistic tradition stretching from ancient artisanal crafts to master Slovene Impressionists Ivana Kobilca and Franc Berneker to today's thriving contemporary arts scene.\nThe planned city was founded in 1947 after the Paris Peace Treaty established the border between Italy and the former Yugoslavia, restricting travel between the two nations. With the Italian city of Gorizia, a regional centre since the Middle Ages, suddenly off-limits to Yugoslavs, the Socialist Yugoslavian government envisioned Nova Gorica (New Gorizia in Slovenian) as a modernist city to cement a new, postwar identity. For decades, the two cities lived on either side of a tumultuous border; steps apart but worlds away.\nNow, united as the 2025 EU Capital of Culture, Nova Gorica and its sister Italian city Gorizia stand as \"the European capital of borderless culture\". Having these two places, so long separated, share this distinction is a testament to a collaborative future.\nAnd Nova Gorica itself – nestled in the idyllic Vipava Valley, famed for its wineries – has become particularly known for its unique combination of modern artistic edge and small-town community feel.\nWe asked Tish, a singer-songwriter who has called Nova Gorica home since she was a teen, to guide us through Europe's unsung artsy capital. For Tish, a 2025 GO! Ambassador, Nova Gorica is its own best champion. \"Slovenia's past as part of Yugoslavia [means] you never feel out of place here,\" she says. \"It's easy to find Serbian or Slovenian food and hear people speaking Slovenian, English, Serbian and Croatian. Being so close to Italy adds another layer of cultural richness. Nova Gorica is truly a unique place, where the feeling of community is so strong that everyone feels welcome.\"\nThe arts are fundamental to Nova Gorica's identity, and as Tish says, the scene \"feels deeply rooted in the community. You can see art all around the city, especially street art. Cankarjeva Ulica [a main street] is full of graffiti, adding colour and energy.\"\nHere are Tish's top recommendations for a visit to artsy Nova Gorica.\nTrg Evrope, called Piazza della Transalpinain Italian after the trans-European Transalpina train that once stopped there, is a stately square that was cut in two by the border until 2004. Like many of her generation, 24-year-old Tish sees it as the true symbol of her city's history. \"Standing here, you can truly feel the essence of Nova Gorica,\" she says, \"shaped by Italy yet distinctly Slovenian in spirit.\" Anchored by the city's monumental train station built in 1906, the centrepiece of the square is the Mosaic of the New Europe, a marker transferred from the old border and transformed into an evocative piece of collective art. Tish recommends a stop at the classic Caffe Bordo, \"right at the train station, where you can enjoy a cosy coffee break\".\nThe square is currently undergoing a major renovation in anticipation of the 2025 Capital of Culture, where it will become the new ECoC District. Set to be completed by the end of 2024, this vibrant square will connect Italy and Slovenia through accessible green urban spaces, art exhibits and an upgraded railway station in Nova Gorica that will improve transport links around Slovenia.\nFounded in 1980, the Nova Gorica Arts Centre champions Slovenian talent with exhibits and performances, and for Tish, it's quite simply \"the heartbeat of Nova Gorica’s vibrant arts scene\". In her opinion, the diversity of the centre's offering reflects the cultural legacy of Nova Gorica itself: \"a great place to stay in tune with the city's musical pulse, from local indie bands to up-and-coming Slovenian artists\". The Arts Centre also manages the circular Mestna Galerija, one of Tish’s favourite galleries, host of the internationally renowned Pixxelpoint festival and a one-time exhibition space for artists Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol. \"It’s the perfect spot to escape for a while and lose yourself in thought-provoking artwork,\" she says.\nAs the Capital of Culture, Nova Gorica will be bursting with cultural activities throughout 2025. Look out for incredible live concerts from Slovenian and international performers – Patti Smith inaugurated the project with a concert in 2023, so the bar has been set high. There will also be a full calendar of art and film festivals; dance companies; thought-provoking installations around the city; and workshops discussing technology, innovation and solutions for a borderless world.\nWebsite: www.kulturnidom-ng.siAddress: Bevkov trg 4, 5000 Nova GoricaPhone: +386 5 335 40 10Instagram: @kulturnidomng\nNova Gorica doesn't just cater to students and young artists; foodies seeking elevated cuisine are also in luck. \"For a refined dining experience, Michelin-starred Restavracija Dam restaurant, just outside the city centre, offers a modern take on Slovenian cuisine,\" says Tish. Helmed by Chef Uroš Fakuč in the posh Dam boutique hotel, Restavracija Dam turns the volume up on Istrian classics like Soča trout and Piran sea bass in a moody, seductive space.\n\"[Dam] masterfully blends local ingredients with creative flair, making it the perfect place to savour the region's culinary artistry,\" says Tish. Pair the restaurant's creative dishes like \"rice with the taste of the sea and the scent of oysters\" with any of the 300 wines from Slovenia, Italy, France and Austria in the cellar.\nWebsite: www.damhotel.si/en/restaurantAddress: Ulica Vinka Vodopivca 24, 5000 Nova GoricaPhone: +386 53 331 147Instagram: @dam_boutique_hotel_restaurant\nFor Tish, Fabrika gastropub has it all. \"It’s the kind of place where you can stop by for a drink or dive into their extensive menu,\" she says. \"Plus, they've got craft beers, creative cocktails… whatever you're in the mood for!\"\nLocated in Nova Gorica's central Bevkov Square, Fabrika is emblematic of Slovenia's trendy-yet-relaxed food scene, where gastropubs and bistros offer all-day eats for every kind of appetite. At Fabrika, you're just as likely to find a group of university friends sharing tacos as grandparents tucking into gigantic burgers made from local Slovenian beef.\nTish also loves what Fabrika offers beyond the menu. \"On Fridays, they host a DJ set, and the place is open all day, every day,\" she says. \"So, it's perfect for a quiet morning or a lively night. Located right in front of the main square, which frequently hosts events and live music, Fabrika is the go-to spot.\"\nSlovenia's Alpine rivers make stellar beers, and small breweries are popping up all over the country. Visitors looking to experience Nova Gorica's craft beer culture can head to Reservoir Dogs, a raucous craft beer taproom on the industrial outskirts of town that offers a wide selection of artisanal brews.\nWebsite: www.fabrika-bar.siAddress: Bevkov Trg 1 5000 Nova GoricaPhone: +386 51 270 999Instagram: @fabrika.novagorica\n\"Nova Gorica's music scene is diverse,\" says Tish. \"Genres range from jazz to indie rock [but] there’s a particularly strong presence of metal, punk and electronic music.\" And hands down, Mostovna is \"the place to be\" to soak up the city's edgy music scene. Located in a former industrial facility right on the Slovenia-Italy border, the punky industrial space is a club and meeting point for free spirits and misfits. \"It's a hotspot, sometimes hosting two shows in one day!\" says Tish. \"You can catch anything from rock, soul and orchestral music to comedy and art exhibitions featuring emerging and established artists from all over Slovenia.\"\nYoung musicians like Tish have a lot of support in Nova Gorica. \"There’s plenty of room for growth in Nova Gorica’s creative scene, and the local support is incredible,\" she says. \"Many musicians perform here, and I've had the amazing opportunity to meet and collaborate with some of the most famous Slovenian artists. It's a small community with excellent connections, making it a great place to grow and get involved in special events featuring some of the country’s biggest performers.\"\nWebsite: www.mostovna.comAddress: Cesta IX. korpusa 99A 5250 SolkanPhone: +386 53 300 912Instagram: @mostovna\nFlowing alongside Nova Gorica and Gorizia, the emerald green Soča River is arguably one of the most beautiful in Europe. Viewing it under the dramatic arches of the 85m-long Solkan Bridge, the world's longest stone arch railroad bridge, is a perfect outdoor experience. \"You can walk or bike along the [river],\" says Tish. \"Try kayaking, or just take in the views. It's the ideal place to soak up the [Soča’s] natural beauty.\" With the rugged Alps in the distance and tiny villages dotting the surrounding Karst hills, this is one of the best places to capture the lofty scenery that makes Slovenia such a stunning place to visit.\nActive visitors will be spoiled for choice here. \"The zipline and kayak club, Soča Fun Park, are perfect if you’re in the mood for adventure,\" says Tish. For optimal people watching, she also recommends grabbing a cocktail at the charming riverside bar, Čolnarna.\nWebsite: www.facebook.com/Colnarna-SolkanAddress: Pot na Breg, 5250 Solkan, SloveniaPhone: +386 68 160 159Instagram: @colnarna_solkan\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n-- \nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

Cankarjeva Ulica [a main street] is full of graffiti, adding colour and energy.\"\nHere are Tish's top recommendations for a visit to artsy Nova Gorica.\nTrg Evrope, called Piazza della Transalpinain Italian after the trans-European Transalpina train that once stopped there, is a stately square that was cut in two by the border until 2004. Like many of her generation, 24-year-old Tish sees it as the true symbol of her city's history. \"Standing here, you can truly feel the essence of Nova Gorica,\" she says, \"shaped by Italy yet distinctly Slovenian in spirit.\" Anchored by the city's monumental train station built in 1906, the centrepiece of the square is the Mosaic of the New Europe, a marker transferred from the old border and transformed into an evocative piece of collective art. Tish recommends a stop at the classic Caffe Bordo, \"right at the train station, where you can enjoy a cosy coffee break\".\nThe square is currently undergoing a major renovation in anticipation of the 2025 Capital of Culture, where it will become the new ECoC District. Set to be completed by the end of 2024, this vibrant square will connect Italy and Slovenia through accessible green urban spaces, art exhibits and an upgraded railway station in Nova Gorica that will improve transport links around Slovenia.\nFounded in 1980, the Nova Gorica Arts Centre champions Slovenian talent with exhibits and performances, and for Tish, it's quite simply \"the heartbeat of Nova Gorica’s vibrant arts scene\". In her opinion, the diversity of the centre's offering reflects the cultural legacy of Nova Gorica itself: \"a great place to stay in tune with the city's musical pulse, from local indie bands to up-and-coming Slovenian artists\". The Arts Centre also manages the circular Mestna Galerija, one of Tish’s favourite galleries, host of the internationally renowned Pixxelpoint festival and a one-time exhibition space for artists Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol. \"It’s the perfect spot to escape for a while and lose yourself in thought-provoking artwork,\" she says.\nAs the Capital of Culture, Nova Gorica will be bursting with cultural activities throughout 2025. Look out for incredible live concerts from Slovenian and international performers – Patti Smith inaugurated the project with a concert in 2023, so the bar has been set high. There will also be a full calendar of art and film festivals; dance companies; thought-provoking installations around the city; and workshops discussing technology, innovation and solutions for a borderless world.\nWebsite: www.kulturnidom-ng.siAddress: Bevkov trg 4, 5000 Nova GoricaPhone: +386 5 335 40 10Instagram: @kulturnidomng\nNova Gorica doesn't just cater to students and young artists; foodies seeking elevated cuisine are also in luck. \"For a refined dining experience, Michelin-starred Restavracija Dam restaurant, just outside the city centre, offers a modern take on Slovenian cuisine,\" says Tish.

{"doc_id": 25, "question": "Which river flows alongside Nova Gorica and is known for its emerald green color?", "answer": ["Soča River"], "doc": "Singer-songwriter Tish grew up on the border of Europe's first-ever borderless Capital of Culture. Here are her picks, from underground jams at Mostovna to Fabrika's famous burgers.\nNova Gorica is one of Slovenia's (and Europe's) youngest cities, but it's grown up fast. Since Slovenia's entry into the EU in 2004, it's become a showpiece for Slovenia's rich artistic tradition stretching from ancient artisanal crafts to master Slovene Impressionists Ivana Kobilca and Franc Berneker to today's thriving contemporary arts scene.\nThe planned city was founded in 1947 after the Paris Peace Treaty established the border between Italy and the former Yugoslavia, restricting travel between the two nations. With the Italian city of Gorizia, a regional centre since the Middle Ages, suddenly off-limits to Yugoslavs, the Socialist Yugoslavian government envisioned Nova Gorica (New Gorizia in Slovenian) as a modernist city to cement a new, postwar identity. For decades, the two cities lived on either side of a tumultuous border; steps apart but worlds away.\nNow, united as the 2025 EU Capital of Culture, Nova Gorica and its sister Italian city Gorizia stand as \"the European capital of borderless culture\". Having these two places, so long separated, share this distinction is a testament to a collaborative future.\nAnd Nova Gorica itself – nestled in the idyllic Vipava Valley, famed for its wineries – has become particularly known for its unique combination of modern artistic edge and small-town community feel.\nWe asked Tish, a singer-songwriter who has called Nova Gorica home since she was a teen, to guide us through Europe's unsung artsy capital. For Tish, a 2025 GO! Ambassador, Nova Gorica is its own best champion. \"Slovenia's past as part of Yugoslavia [means] you never feel out of place here,\" she says. \"It's easy to find Serbian or Slovenian food and hear people speaking Slovenian, English, Serbian and Croatian. Being so close to Italy adds another layer of cultural richness. Nova Gorica is truly a unique place, where the feeling of community is so strong that everyone feels welcome.\"\nThe arts are fundamental to Nova Gorica's identity, and as Tish says, the scene \"feels deeply rooted in the community.

{"doc_id": 26, "question": "What is the name of the once-moribund railway line that has been resurrected in north-eastern Honshu?", "answer": ["Sanriku Railway Rias Line"], "doc": "Iwate and Fukushima Prefectures were ravaged by the 2011 tsunami that precipitated a catastrophic nuclear disaster. Now, this tragic, beguiling region is welcoming travellers back.\nHope spiralled tender as a rice shoot along the resurrected Sanriku Railway Rias Line in north-eastern Honshu. Summer's blooms spilled from pots on station platforms; storybook houses peeped from the forests' folds; a man knelt beside the ice-blue river and cleansed a fistful of spring onions. Rice crops flashing by in the valleys were ripe for the harvest: their imperial yellow shimmer filled the windows as my friend and I rattled along this once-moribund coastline.\nOn 11 March 2011, communities along the north-eastern seaboard of Japan's biggest island, Honshu, were swept from their moorings when an earthquake measuring 9.1 on the Richter scale precipitated a tsunami of monumental proportion. Seawater barrelled into the saw-toothed shoreline, upturning infrastructure, buckling forests, flushing lives from every crevice. When the oily tide receded, little but splintered flotsam remained.  \nSuch devastation is familiar to this country located atop a fault-line; the archipelago nation has endured too many natural disasters to remember – most recently, in January 2024, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture. But remembrance is the ritual whereby the Japanese make sense of their fate. In Honshu, a purpose-drawn map demarcates the numerous \"disaster memorial facilities\" strung out along the 500km stretch of coastline affected by The Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami of 2011. Obscured from view below the railway line are cairns erected by earlier generations to warn of nature's ferocity.\n\"Don't build homes below this point,\" reads one inscription. \"No matter how many years have passed, be alert for tsunami.\"\nThat volatile ocean was a sea of tranquillity as we rambled northwards from the city of Kamaishi to Namiitakaigan, a seaside hamlet four hours north of Sendai in Iwate Prefecture. Here, flowers trailed from the cottage gardens abutting Namiitakaigan Station; a cenotaph 266m uphill from the beach was looped with Japanese script: \"This is where the tsunami reached.\"\nWe'd been drawn here by a story: in a beautiful garden on a nearby hill stands a phone box where people commune with the dead. Before the disaster, Namiitakaigan resident Itaru Sasaki created a metaphorical connection with his recently deceased cousin by placing a disconnected telephone inside a British-style phone box. Here, he explained in a 2016 episode of This American Life, he could speak to his cousin, his thoughts \"carried on the wind\". As stories of Sasaki's ritual spread, those affected by the tsunami – and other tragedies – arrived to seek their own solace on \"The Phone of the Wind\".\nThough thousands of people have trod the path to Sasaki's garden, we were its sole visitors that day. Birds flitted between frothy crepe myrtles and maple leaves slowly changing colour; it was a poignant setting in which to meditate on loss: so electric with life, so hefted with sorrow. I closed the phone box door behind me, lifted the receiver and silently communed with the loved ones I'd lost. \nThe mood lifted on the way back into town: we met a woman pushing a pastry cart from door to door, and bought two of her custard-filled doughnuts.\n\"Oishi! (Delicious!)\" we said, skipping down the hill.\nSecond-hand memory assailed us once more on the road leading to Minshuku Takamasu, our lodging for the night: \"Tsunami Inundation Section,\" a sign said. But proprietor Yasuko Nakamura's face was wreathed with a smile as she welcomed us in. Only the roof of her elevated ryokan was damaged by the tsunami, she communicated through gestures and a translation app and my friend's rusty Japanese. \n“I was at my home in Trono [an hour’s drive inland] when it came,” she said.\nAnd though foreign guests are now rare, Nakamura was busy enough with her long-term lodgers: high school boarders, a fisherman-diver who made his living from the bay, a builder working on the reconstruction of the nearby town of Otsuchi, which we'd passed through on our way here. Half of its dwellings and most of its commercial properties were wiped out by the tsunami. The builder's efforts would help to make Otsuchi stronger, he said, as Nakamura served the fruits of that once-vengeful sea for dinner: wakame (seaweed) salad, grilled saba (mackerel), miso broth bobbing with a delectable but indeterminate ingredient. \n\"What is it?\" I typed into her app.\n\"It’s made by kneading fish,\" she explained, her Japanese script blooming as graceful as the kaiseki bowls she'd laid before us.\nThe fisherman-diver, we learned, owned an apple orchard in his home prefecture, Aomori. It snowed a lot there, he said, climbing out from an imaginary drift. Mercifully he wasn't diving off Namiitakaigan when the tsunami swelled forth. We shuddered collectively at the thought: there was no need to translate such imagined terror.\nNext morning, we accepted a parting gift from Nakamura: delicately painted jars filled with sake.\n\"Famous sake, from Kamaishi,\" she said.\nFrom Namiitakaigan, the train rumbled south along a coastline lapped by gentle waves. It was impossible to reconcile this scene with the images of 2011, when railway tunnels flooded, girders buckled and Koishihama Station was washed clean away. Now, scallop shell wreaths overflowed from an alcove on the station's reconstructed platform; a group of pre-schoolers alighted here with their teachers and affixed their own shell-adorned pennant to the shrine. \n\"A prayer,\" said a woman on the train who had intuited the question in our eyes.\nBut elementary tributes soon transformed into elegant homages. At our next stop, Rikuzentakata, the Hiroshi Naito-designed Iwate Tsunami Memorial Museum plugged the shoreline like a brilliant white tombstone. The sky danced on the pool of reflection through an aperture in the portico ceiling; in the wings leading off it, we heard survivor testimonies, watched multimedia displays, pondered objects recovered from the deluge: a crumpled fire truck, a child's mud-spattered keyboard, a bus stop folded like origami. Remembrance gave way to deep reflection in the exhibits addressing bureaucratic shortcomings, outlining mitigation strategies for future disasters, expressing gratitude for the world's outpourings of assistance and sorrow.\n\"It is wisdom passed down to future generations,\" said guide Satoko Kinno.\nWe had a bus to catch, but Kinno urged us to climb the seawall overlooking the fledging forest fringing the bay – a replacement for the centuries-old pine plantation that once girded the city against the ocean's vagaries. The Miracle Lone Pine Tree was the plantation's sole survivor. But lethally poisoned by saltwater, it died in 2012; was it finished off by grief, I wondered? Now preserved with chemicals and supported by a steel rod, this monument loomed above the flattened landscape, a powerful symbol of resilience. Nearby, the tsunami-dashed ruins of Rikuzentakata Youth Hostel slumped over a pond as though mourning their own reflection.\nFrom the seawall we looked back at the museum, which from this angle appeared to have been sliced from the bedrock. The masterpiece was enfolded in the tidy green skirts of Takata Matsubara Tsunami Reconstruction Memorial Park.\nBeyond it, Rikuzentakata arose anew from the slurry.\nThe railway line south of the city - dismantled, too, by that wall of seawater - was still awaiting repairs. We caught the replacement Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) to Kesennuma, and the train onwards to Sendai. Here we boarded an empty carriage on the JR Joban Line bound south for Fukushima Prefecture. Until a few hours earlier, we had no idea where we'd be staying that night. Hotels were sparse along this route, the coastline it traversed still burdened by fallout from the tsunami-triggered nuclear disaster.\nDarkness had fallen by the time we arrived at Haranomachi Station. Not a soul roamed the streets. The lacquered facade of a ramen bar glowed red, but no one stirred inside. We bought sandwiches from a 7-Eleven and retreated to our room at Hotel Areaone Minamisoma, which seemed bereft of other guests.\nMore like this:• The Michinoku Coastal Trail: Japan's new 1,000km path• Japan's beloved slow-motion train• A new night train connecting some of the continent's great cities\nAs though summoned by us, a shuttle bus was waiting outside the station the next morning at Futaba, located close to the site of the nuclear accident. Radiation levels here are said to have returned to normal. Bright murals flowed across the huddle of buildings still standing in a part of town recast as \"Futaba Art District\". Acres of wasteland spooled by as the bus driver steered us towards The Great East Japan Earthquake and Nuclear Disaster Memorial Museum. There it stood amid a sea of empty lots: a pale edifice of Cubist proportions – a white elephant, perhaps?\nBut to our surprise it was brimming with visitors, mostly high school students on excursions. I observed them absorbing, wide-eyed, events they were too young to remember. Then I stared for a long time at a model inspired by the Fukushima Innovation Coast Framework, an initiave aimed at re-establishing an industrial base in this decimated region; it depicted Futaba rebuilt as a \"city of the future\": lush farmland, vibrant streets, a beach filled with holidaying families.\n\"It's growing step by step,\" said guide Kenichiro Hiramoto. \"Only 70 or 80 [residents have returned] to Futaba Town, but they try to organise their community. Now the trend is newcomers, young people – and, of course, the municipality supports them.\"  \nWe will visit this city of the future 20 years hence, pledged my friend and I on the train to Iwaki, two-and-a-half hours south of Futaba. Though badly damaged by the tsunami, the city has rebounded. After dinner that night we descended into a basement bar, Burrows, just as it was closing. Owner Kazuya Hanazawa agreed to mix two last cocktails. Shaking, stirring, cutting wedges of lime, he lamented the hundreds of Iwaki residents lost to the tsunami. He spent six months afterwards helping mop up, and made his bartop from wood salvaged from the wreckage.   \n\"Japanese are very tough,\" he said, pressing his fist to his heart. \"I wanted to create a place where people could feel good. It's a small [start], but people from all over – Okinawa, Hokkaido, all of Japan – are coming back to Iwaki.\"\nHanazawa placed our cocktails before us: vodka concoctions fizzing like daylight in the gloom.\n\"Kanpai (Cheers),\" we three said.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

The builder's efforts would help to make Otsuchi stronger, he said, as Nakamura served the fruits of that once-vengeful sea for dinner: wakame (seaweed) salad, grilled saba (mackerel), miso broth bobbing with a delectable but indeterminate ingredient. \n\"What is it?\" I typed into her app.\n\"It’s made by kneading fish,\" she explained, her Japanese script blooming as graceful as the kaiseki bowls she'd laid before us.\nThe fisherman-diver, we learned, owned an apple orchard in his home prefecture, Aomori. It snowed a lot there, he said, climbing out from an imaginary drift. Mercifully he wasn't diving off Namiitakaigan when the tsunami swelled forth. We shuddered collectively at the thought: there was no need to translate such imagined terror.\nNext morning, we accepted a parting gift from Nakamura: delicately painted jars filled with sake.\n\"Famous sake, from Kamaishi,\" she said.\nFrom Namiitakaigan, the train rumbled south along a coastline lapped by gentle waves. It was impossible to reconcile this scene with the images of 2011, when railway tunnels flooded, girders buckled and Koishihama Station was washed clean away. Now, scallop shell wreaths overflowed from an alcove on the station's reconstructed platform; a group of pre-schoolers alighted here with their teachers and affixed their own shell-adorned pennant to the shrine. \n\"A prayer,\" said a woman on the train who had intuited the question in our eyes.\nBut elementary tributes soon transformed into elegant homages. At our next stop, Rikuzentakata, the Hiroshi Naito-designed Iwate Tsunami Memorial Museum plugged the shoreline like a brilliant white tombstone. The sky danced on the pool of reflection through an aperture in the portico ceiling; in the wings leading off it, we heard survivor testimonies, watched multimedia displays, pondered objects recovered from the deluge: a crumpled fire truck, a child's mud-spattered keyboard, a bus stop folded like origami. Remembrance gave way to deep reflection in the exhibits addressing bureaucratic shortcomings, outlining mitigation strategies for future disasters, expressing gratitude for the world's outpourings of assistance and sorrow.\n\"It is wisdom passed down to future generations,\" said guide Satoko Kinno.\nWe had a bus to catch, but Kinno urged us to climb the seawall overlooking the fledging forest fringing the bay – a replacement for the centuries-old pine plantation that once girded the city against the ocean's vagaries. The Miracle Lone Pine Tree was the plantation's sole survivor. But lethally poisoned by saltwater, it died in 2012; was it finished off by grief, I wondered? Now preserved with chemicals and supported by a steel rod, this monument loomed above the flattened landscape, a powerful symbol of resilience. Nearby, the tsunami-dashed ruins of Rikuzentakata Youth Hostel slumped over a pond as though mourning their own reflection.\nFrom the seawall we looked back at the museum, which from this angle appeared to have been sliced from the bedrock. The masterpiece was enfolded in the tidy green skirts of Takata Matsubara Tsunami Reconstruction Memorial Park.\nBeyond it, Rikuzentakata arose anew from the slurry.\nThe railway line south of the city - dismantled, too, by that wall of seawater - was still awaiting repairs. We caught the replacement Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) to Kesennuma, and the train onwards to Sendai. Here we boarded an empty carriage on the JR Joban Line bound south for Fukushima Prefecture. Until a few hours earlier, we had no idea where we'd be staying that night. Hotels were sparse along this route, the coastline it traversed still burdened by fallout from the tsunami-triggered nuclear disaster.\nDarkness had fallen by the time we arrived at Haranomachi Station. Not a soul roamed the streets. The lacquered facade of a ramen bar glowed red, but no one stirred inside. We bought sandwiches from a 7-Eleven and retreated to our room at Hotel Areaone Minamisoma, which seemed bereft of other guests.\nMore like this:• The Michinoku Coastal Trail: Japan's new 1,000km path• Japan's beloved slow-motion train• A new night train connecting some of the continent's great cities\nAs though summoned by us, a shuttle bus was waiting outside the station the next morning at Futaba, located close to the site of the nuclear accident. Radiation levels here are said to have returned to normal. Bright murals flowed across the huddle of buildings still standing in a part of town recast as \"Futaba Art District\". Acres of wasteland spooled by as the bus driver steered us towards The Great East Japan Earthquake and Nuclear Disaster Memorial Museum. There it stood amid a sea of empty lots: a pale edifice of Cubist proportions – a white elephant, perhaps?\nBut to our surprise it was brimming with visitors, mostly high school students on excursions. I observed them absorbing, wide-eyed, events they were too young to remember. Then I stared for a long time at a model inspired by the Fukushima Innovation Coast Framework, an initiave aimed at re-establishing an industrial base in this decimated region; it depicted Futaba rebuilt as a \"city of the future\": lush farmland, vibrant streets, a beach filled with holidaying families.\n\"It's growing step by step,\" said guide Kenichiro Hiramoto. \"Only 70 or 80 [residents have returned] to Futaba Town, but they try to organise their community. Now the trend is newcomers, young people – and, of course, the municipality supports them.\"  \nWe will visit this city of the future 20 years hence, pledged my friend and I on the train to Iwaki, two-and-a-half hours south of Futaba. Though badly damaged by the tsunami, the city has rebounded. After dinner that night we descended into a basement bar, Burrows, just as it was closing. Owner Kazuya Hanazawa agreed to mix two last cocktails. Shaking, stirring, cutting wedges of lime, he lamented the hundreds of Iwaki residents lost to the tsunami. He spent six months afterwards helping mop up, and made his bartop from wood salvaged from the wreckage.   \n\"Japanese are very tough,\" he said, pressing his fist to his heart. \"I wanted to create a place where people could feel good. It's a small [start], but people from all over – Okinawa, Hokkaido, all of Japan – are coming back to Iwaki.\"\nHanazawa placed our cocktails before us: vodka concoctions fizzing like daylight in the gloom.\n\"Kanpai (Cheers),\" we three said.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}
{"doc_id": 27, "question": "What is the name of the lagoon where Pacific gray whales come to interact with humans?", "answer": ["Laguna San Ignacio"], "doc": "Once nearly hunted to extinction, Pacific gray whales in Mexico's Laguna San Ignacio now seem to be as curious about us as we are about them.\n\"Here she comes again!\" our guide, José Sanchez, announces as a massive gray whale approaches us for the fifth time in 45 minutes. Each time our curious new friend returns to our idle fishing boat, it stays a bit longer on the surface, watching us as we watch her.\nThis is our final outing to see what locals call \"the friendlies\" – the gray whales in Mexico's Laguna San Ignacio. As our boat quietly sits with its engine off, this 40-ton whale playfully rubs up against the sides of the boat, raising the top half of its white-speckled body and cosying up right along the hull as if to check out all six of us onboard. When the whale's eye – which is about the size of a baseball – breaks the surface and meets mine for a moment, I shriek with delight.\nWe're told to give whales distance, but what happens when they come to watch us?\nLocated on the western coast of Baja California Sur's peninsula, the Laguna San Ignacio is considered the last undisturbed breeding and calving lagoon of the Pacific gray whale. The protected whale sanctuary is also home to one of the world's most unusual wildlife encounters: here, curious whales regularly, and voluntarily, seek out contact with humans.\nEvery year from January to mid-April, thousands of gray whales arrive in the lagoon during a 19,300km journey from the icy waters of the Arctic to the warm waters of Baja California Sur to mate and give birth. While these are now safe waters for nursing and breeding, gray whales were once hunted here. Yet, the animals now seem to have learned to trust humans. In fact, during my recent whale-watching trip with Sanchez's eco-tourism company Pure Baja Travels, we witnessed mothers bringing their calves over to boats to present them like proud parents.\nThese unique encounters have influenced the conservation and protection of these gentle giants and spurred a thrilling – and responsible – whale-watching experience like nowhere else.\nFor more than 50 years, gray whales in Baja have shown they seem to be as curious about us as we are them. Marine biologists believe a combination of circumstances contribute to this unique behaviour.\n\"In the lagoon, today, there are no real threats,\" says Dr Steven Swartz, a cetacean researcher who has been studying gray whales at Laguna San Ignacio for 45 years. While gray whales have been known to occasionally approach humans elsewhere, according to Swartz, this is the only place where they regularly do so, and where the animals linger and often rise above the water's surface, allowing humans to touch them.\nWhale-watching is only permitted in a specific \"zone\" of the protected whale sanctuary, and there are strict rules: only 16 pangas (small fishing boats) are allowed in this zone at a time. To not overwhelm the whales, all boats must turn off their motors when whales approach. And most importantly, boat operators don't chase or pursue the whales.\n\"[Guides] put you in the presence of the whales, and let the whales decide if they're going to come over, and say hello or not,\" says Swartz.\nBut why do the whales seem to come and say hello? \"Mammals are curious; they are sentient enough to learn about their environment, and they learn by exploring,\" Swartz explains, adding that mothers pass on this curiosity towards boats and people to their calves. \"[The whales] are capable of remembering.\"\nWhales, in general, are very tactile; they like to rub and touch; that's how they communicate, Swartz says. Pacific gray whales aren't busy looking for food (they do that in the Arctic), so perhaps they're also bored, he suggests. While we cannot know exactly why the whales do what they do, Swartz and other marine biologists all agree the whales approach the boats voluntarily.\nGray whales were nearly hunted to extinction during the 18th and 19th Centuries, and as a result, the animals tended to act aggressively towards humans – so much so that local fishermen even dubbed them \"devil fish\" and avoided them. But in 1972, a man named Francisco (Pachico) Mayoral was out fishing in Baja when a whale surfaced and lingered by his boat. Curiosity compelled him to put his hand in the water. The whale rubbed against Mayoral and stayed by his hand.\nNews of Mayoral's experience spread, and locals, much less afraid, waited patiently to experience similar friendly encounters. \"Gray whales specifically are naturally curious and have never been afraid of approaching floating items in the water. Humans hurt them, and then the gray whales reacted to that interaction,\" Sanchez tells me. \"After [Mayoral's] first peaceful contact, humans started to realise gray whales are not the scary and mad animals we thought they were.\"\nSanchez was the first Mexican naturalist to guide whale-watching tours in the lagoon back in the 1990s, and his own eco-tourism company now has a base camp on San Ignacio Lagoon. \"As time has gone by, humans are becoming less afraid to let gray whales get closer to the point of close contact. I believe this is [also true for gray whales].\"\nIn 1972, the Mexican government created the San Ignacio Lagoon nature reserve, and in 1988, declared the lagoon a whale sanctuary within El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve, the largest wildlife refuge in Latin America. Five years later, it was designated as a Unesco World Heritage Site. The gray whale population recovered and was removed from the endangered species protection in 1994.\nThat year, Mayoral tipped off environmentalists that Mitsubishi and the Mexican government were planning to build a massive salt factory within the nature reserve. The salt mine was thwarted in 2000 by a robust effort from the local and international community – drawing activists from Robert F Kennedy Jr to actor Christopher Reeves to Baja's shores to join the protest. Today, the battle to save Baja's gray whales is considered one of the greatest wildlife conservation success stories of our time.\nMayoral passed away in 2013, but he's been referred to as the \"saviour of gray whales\" and the grandfather of whale-watching in Baja. Ever since his first peaceful encounter, visitors and locals alike have sought out a similar experience in Baja the lagoon. In fact, Mayoral's family is still running whale-watching trips.\nMore like this:• An ethical – and safe – place to swim with whales • The hidden wonders of Mexico's sacred underwater world • Thirteen photos that will make you care about the ocean\nToday, the human-whale encounters in the San Ignacio Lagoon have not only fuelled conservation efforts but also inspired a regulated eco-tourism industry, which provides a meaningful source of income to local communities.\n\"Eco-tourism is the economic basis for the community.

She joined WildCoast, an international nonprofit organisation that has been a leading force in the gray whale conservation efforts for more than 25 years, to amplify the voices of the community.\nWildCoast's co-founder and executive director Serge Dedina worked to permanently protect 450,000-acres of San Ignacio Lagoon habitat in 2004. helped to successfully lobby the Mexican government for San Ignacio Lagoon to be included in the El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve, the largest wildlife refuge in Latin America, back in 1988. Now he says Laguna San Ignacio is a global model showing how to protect wildlife while creating sustainable development. The organisation helps to train ecotourism guides, enhance outreach and expand women-led mangrove restoration programmes that help fight climate change.\nWith the climate crisis affecting the migratory path of the whales, the restoration of mangroves (which sequester 10 times more carbon than tropical forests) is another battle Laguna San Ignacio area residents are fighting every day, along with needing to regulate development and tourism around the lagoons.\n\"There's something about the whales that makes you feel overwhelmed, with almost a responsibility to take care of them.

At 22 years old, Bastida connects the grassroots conservation efforts that started a generation ago to the climate crisis facing this generation. She joined WildCoast, an international nonprofit organisation that has been a leading force in the gray whale conservation efforts for more than 25 years, to amplify the voices of the community.\nWildCoast's co-founder and executive director Serge Dedina worked to permanently protect 450,000-acres of San Ignacio Lagoon habitat in 2004. helped to successfully lobby the Mexican government for San Ignacio Lagoon to be included in the El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve, the largest wildlife refuge in Latin America, back in 1988. Now he says Laguna San Ignacio is a global model showing how to protect wildlife while creating sustainable development. The organisation helps to train ecotourism guides, enhance outreach and expand women-led mangrove restoration programmes that help fight climate change.\nWith the climate crisis affecting the migratory path of the whales, the restoration of mangroves (which sequester 10 times more carbon than tropical forests) is another battle Laguna San Ignacio area residents are fighting every day, along with needing to regulate development and tourism around the lagoons.\n\"There's something about the whales that makes you feel overwhelmed, with almost a responsibility to take care of them. When the whale pushes up her calf so you can touch it, that is an immense amount of trust,\" Bastida tells BBC.\n\"We call them the friendly whales, but I think they are the conscious whales, and they want us to be more conscious and more in touch,\" she adds. \"I hope that if people see the film or if they are fortunate to see the whales, they can find a piece of themselves they didn't know they had – an instinct to protect [them].\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}
{"doc_id": 28, "question": "According to the MBO Partners' Digital Nomads Report, how much has the number of digital nomads grown since the pandemic?", "answer": ["131%"], "doc": "Whether seen as a positive or a negative, the digital nomad trend continues with new visas and organisations aimed at this population popping up around the world.\nThe term \"digital nomad\" may seem buzzy, but it actually comes from a book of the same name by Tsugio Makimoto and David Manners that, on its publication in 1997, predicted a future workforce of globe-trotting travellers logging in from abroad. The authors proposed that technological advances and humanity's will to explore would allow for a more mobile workforce. In the nearly three decades since, and with the advent of easily accessible wi-fi and online resources for travellers, the trend has exploded. So, too, has controversy, or at the very least, disagreement around it.\nFor many, digital nomadism is the ultimate dream lifestyle, allowing freedom of movement and the ability to explore the world while earning a living. Meanwhile, others say it contributes to gentrification and overtourism, that it drives up prices and makes cities nearly unliveable for locals. Now, a growing number of nations are upfront about a desire to attract these upwardly mobile visitors and have begun offering new visas for workers, while organisations spring up to attend to their needs.\nThough the necessary technology existed, the digital nomad movement didn't really take off until the 2010s, largely among young people looking for an early-career escape from the decades of 9-5 office work they saw looming before them. \"When we think about our parents, it was about getting into a job, getting that 401k and going up the corporate ladder,\" explained Evita Robinson, Emmy award-winning creator of the NOMADNESS Travel Tribe, a social community for travellers of colour. \"We're really kind of blowing that ideology up in many ways because we aren't waiting to retire to travel and see the world.\"\nBut according to author, speaker and political scientist Lauren Razavi in her book Global Natives: The New Frontiers of Work, Travel, and Innovation, many of the original digital nomads were wealthy white men working either in the tech industry or as a kind of precursor to today's travel influencer, showcasing their glamorous lifestyle while making money selling guides to those interested in doing the same. However, as the possibility of remote work spread, so did the trend of working from anywhere.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic only added fuel to the fire, as worldwide lockdowns proved that more people than ever were able to do their jobs online. Though restrictions lifted and people were able to return to the office – many chose not to. According to commercial real estate solutions provider Moody's commercial real estate market analysis, more than 20% of corporate real estate remains empty, while a 2023 report by MBO Partners,  an enterprise solutions company that services companies with remote workers, estimates that more than thirty-five million people now consider themselves digital nomads.\nWith the increased interest in travel post pandemic and the flexible nature of remote work, it's perhaps no surprise that the trend has grown so quickly. \"Now is the time in our history where we've had the most passports and we've had all of this access,\" says Marquita Harris, a journalist and frequent digital nomad. \"To me, being a digital nomad has given me the opportunity to travel deeper, to understand way more than I ever could when I would just take a vacation for four days somewhere. And I feel like I learned just so much from those experiences.\"\nHowever, not everyone sees the increase of this trend, which the MBO Partner's Digital Nomads Report estimates has grown a whopping 131% since the pandemic, as a good thing. The influx of visitors to places like Spain and Greece have also fuelled heated protests against overtourism. In places like the Dominican Republic, Bali and South Africa, many locals feel that digital nomads have caused a strain on already scarce resources and driven up the prices of goods and housing beyond what they can reasonably afford.\n\"I think, a lot of the same issues that arise when we're talking about tourism in general, when we're talking about digital nomads,\" explains Mechi Annas Estvez Cruz, a writer and native of the Dominican Republic. \"Most of the time they're used to a certain level of comfort. So those Airbnb's that they're going to be looking for are going to be foreign [owned]. So, you come, and you say it's really cheap… cheap for who? With time, as you show up, and then you tell your friends to show up and this place becomes a safe haven for digital nomads, you're actually driving the cost of everything up.\"\nIt's not just happening in the Dominican Republic; across the globe, locals are finding themselves priced out of popular cities and towns. For example, let prices in the Balearic Islands have increased by about 18% in the last year according to a recent report by Idealista.  \nRobinson also sees the dichotomy of this situation: \"This is actually a question about gentrification,\" she told the BBC. \"I see this over and over again in the work that I do. It's heartbreaking actually and it's conflicting, these circumstances in which [visitors are] running the community out.\"\nSo is there a way to be a digital nomad without contributing to inequality and overtourism? Juan Barbed, Co-Founder of ROORAL, stresses the importance of connecting with locals and being part of the community. ROORAL is an organisation that creates infrastructure for remote workers interested in spending time working in struggling rural towns in Spain. For Barbed, the key to ensuring that this model was a help rather than a hinderance to local communities was involving them in the process ahead of time. \"We are not a private initiative that opens up in a place and then we [move in],\" Barbed explained. \"We talk with the leadership of those communities to see if this is something that they want to try. If the answer is no, it's like, OK, bye.\"\nThis more community-based approach is contrary to many earlier organisations and companies that offered long-term lets and hi-speed wi-fi, but often resulted in insular, and expensive, expat communities. However, as the trend grows, the people who make up the digital nomad community has changed, instead of the young male tech workers who started the trend, an increasing number of families are taking up the lifestyle, and organisations like NOMADNESS have greatly improved its diversity, both of which will ideally have a very different impact on the destinations that welcome these groups.\nThis change seems reflected in Harris' thoughts on her time as a digital nomad:  \"[I think it's important to] make sure that you are contributing to the place's, not just economy, but like the culture of a place. You are essentially contributing to gentrification if you're not careful. Look at where you're spending your money and above all, if you're in a place for a month, and you don't at least make one friend there that's from there, I'm sorry, you're not doing it right.\" \nCruz however, is still sceptical: \"How [do you live in a place] in a way that actually respects the dignity of the people who have been receiving uninvited guests since 1492? And trying to do so with grace, may I add, while being exploited. I need anybody who has a powerful passport and engages in travel for leisure to sit with that tension entirely.\"\nWith new visas in countries like Japan and the UAE, aimed at luring mobile international workers on the rise, it's likely that the trend will continue to expand to even more demographics and locations. Though it's possible that the visas will help regulate the number of digital nomads, as well as ensure they're contributing something more to the local economy.\nFor Robinson, the expansion and continuation of this trend is a good thing. However, she cautions that travellers and countries alike need to be a bit more mindful in order to combat the potential negative effects of the digital nomad lifestyle.\n\"I think people need to approach travel overall, but definitely a digital nomad lifestyle, with a sense of consciousness and accountability,\" she said. \"There are ways to do it right, but I think that people are just so… romanticised maybe by the lifestyle and what they can get from it, that they forget that they're coming into somebody else's community, and they also need to think about how they can give back.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

{"doc_id": 30, "question": "When did Oktoberfest start?", "answer": ["Oktoberfest started back in 1810"], "doc": "He's one of the greatest fullbacks of all time, and a proud Münchner to boot. Here are Lahm's picks for exploring Munich, during Oktoberfest and beyond.\nEvery year in late September, throngs descend upon Munich to enjoy its two-week-long explosion of bacchic revelry: Oktoberfest.\nThe party started back in 1810, when Bavaria's Prince Ludwig invited the citizens of Munich to celebrate his wedding, and the festivities simply never stopped – Oktoberfest has ballooned into Germany's most well-known beer festival. Today, while Oktoberfest celebrations are held in many German cities and overseas destinations, Munich's Oktoberfest reigns supreme, attracting roughly six million visitors from all over the world.\nBut the Bavarian capital is so much more than sum of its pints. As the epicentre of the German Baroque movement and a keeper of some of the country's oldest traditions, it boasts an enviable array of both cultural and natural diversions that are sure to keep any visitor entertained in between the chugs.\nTo get to the heart of this vibrant city, we spoke to lifelong Münchner Philipp Lahm, the German football legend who captained the German national team when it won the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\"I grew up very sheltered with my family,\" Lahm says. \"[Munich]'s a big city, but it's not too big… And, of course, it shaped my football career because I had a world-class club in my hometown.\"\nWhile tourism has been a source of tension for some European destinations grappling with its nastier side effects, Oktoberfest remains a source of pride for Munich, and – as Lahm notes – it embodies the \"welcoming\" spirit of the city.\nLahm encourages foreigners visiting for Oktoberfest to follow the local traditions – getting the dress code right, for instance, and eschewing the larger tents for the smaller ones favoured by the locals.\nBut he also hopes visitors will venture outside the Theresienwiese – the 42-hectare site where the festival is held – to discover the Bavarian city's full beauty, from its bustling markets and serene parks to the very stadium where Lahm played for more than 10 seasons.\nHere are Lahm's favourite places in his hometown of Munich.\nFor more than 200 years, locals have been convening at Munich's Viktualienmarkt in the city's Aldstadt (medieval ancient quarter) to stock up on fresh produce.\nWhile the city's market used to be held in its neo-Gothic Marienplatz – the Bavarian capital's unmistakeable symbol – it was eventually moved to a nearby square, where the former farmers' hub has now become renowned for its refined gourmet treats.\nIt's also Lahm's first stop for savouring Munich's culture. \"You can get the whole idea of what Munich is about,\" he says.\nThe market's atmosphere is quaint and demure, with small fountains nestled between more than 100 food stalls, selling all manner of local delicacies, from Bavarian cream doughnuts and cheese spreads (Obatzda), to the famed local white sausage (Müncher Weißwurst) – a reputed hangover cure.\n\"There are lots of different stalls,\" Lahm says. \"There are food and drink options, you can buy fruit and vegetables, so it's a lovely atmosphere in the centre of town.\"\nBeer is never far away in Munich, and, at the end of a stroll, you can enjoy a pint or two under the chestnut trees of the market's beer garden, which is open every day from 09:00 to 22:00.\nWebsite: https://www.viktualienmarkt-muenchen.de/en/home/ Address: Viktualienmarkt 3, 80331 Phone number: +49 89 8906 8205 Instagram: @viktualienmarkt_muenchen\nAt the foot of the Bavarian Alps and bordered by lush forests and rolling hills, Munich is a nature-lover's paradise.\nRoughly 7km from the city centre, the Olympic Park – known locally as Olympiapark and inaugurated for the 1972 Olympic Games – serves as a gateway to the city's more bucolic side.\n\"It's a large park,\" says Lahm. \"The roofs are still the same as they used to be, the stands in the indoor swimming pool are still similar to what they were back then, so the Olympic Park is a wonderful place to be active, but also to experience the history of the Olympic Games.\"\nThe park's 60m-tall hill, Olympiaberg, not only offers unparalleled views of its surroundings, but it also has an added perk: it allows park-goers a peek inside the Olympic Stadium.\nOnce a well-kept secret, videos went viral on social media this summer, showing thousands enjoying Taylor Swift and Coldplay concerts for free from the top of the hill.\nBut for the best views of the city and its surroundings, Lahm advises heading up to the top of the TV tower.\n\"From there you simply have a wonderful view over Munich,\" he says. \"You can [even] see the Alps from there.\"\nWebsite: https://www.olympiapark.de/en Address: Spiridon-Louis-Ring 21, 80809 München, Germany Phone: +49 89 3067 2054 Instagram: @olympiapark\nIt would seem unlikely to associate Munich, which is more than 500km from the ocean, with water sports.\nYet, the city's Englischer Garten (English Garden) allows visitors to try their hand at a seemingly unlikely pursuit: surfing.\nThe sprawling, 3.75sq-km English Garden was opened in 1792, and is a testament to the whimsical, romanticist fantasies of the time, peppered with follies, lakes and pagodas. But among its most striking features is the Eisbach (\"ice brook\"), a man-made river with an artificial wave suitable for surfing – making it particularly popular in the dog days of summer.\n\"[There are] the Eisbach surfers in the middle of the city, a small, fantastic wave where lots of people are surfing and there are many spectators,\" says Lahm. \"It's something very special for me in a big city.\"\nWebsite: https://www.englischer-garten-muenchen-infos.de/en/ Address: Englischer Garten 1, 80538 / (Eisbach) Prinzregentenstr 1, 80538 Phone: +49 89 3866 6390\nWhile Munich might be more typically associated with the colourful folklore of its centuries-old traditions, it is also one of Europe's economic motors and a hub of innovation. So for those travelling to Munich with little ones – yes, the Munich Oktoberfest is proudly kid-friendly – Lahm suggests taking a detour to the Deutsches Museum for an enriching, family-oriented educational experience.\n\"Children can be active there, but of course [you can] experience a lot of the history and everything about Germany,\" he says.\nOpened in 1903 on Museuminsel (Munich's \"Museum Island\"), the Deutsches Museum is the world's biggest science and technology museum. Its colossal collection of more than 28,000 items is housed in four separate buildings, and visitors can explore its 20 permanent exhibits ranging from astronautics to robotics to historical transportation; a welcome distraction from Oktoberfest's noisier shenanigans.\nWebsite: https://www.deutsches-museum.de Address: Museumsinsel 1, 80538 Phone number: +49 89 2179 333 Instagram: @deutschesmuseum\nSomething of a pilgrimage site for football fans since its opening in 2005, Munich's Allianz Arena is no regular stadium. Widely considered one of the world's most striking sporting grounds, designed in the distinctive Bauhaus style, it is the home stadium of FC Bayern Munich.\n\"It's always worth visiting the [FC Bayern Museum] in the Allianz Arena,\" Lahm says. \"A guided tour of the Allianz Arena is always something special, because I believe that Munich is known worldwide for the Oktoberfest on the one hand, but also for FC Bayern on the other.\"\nLahm's memories of his time at the stadium are tinged with a palpable nostalgia, not only because of his successes on the fields – but because he got to represent the very place in which he grew up.\n\"What's always great and what not everyone gets to experience is playing a home tournament,\" he says. \"I was very lucky to play the World Cup in Germany in 2006, and the opening game was in the Allianz Arena, in my hometown. My family and friends were in the stadium, it was [my] first World Cup.\"\n\"I also scored 1-0… just a few kilometres from my home,\" he says. \"And that's something very special.

As the epicentre of the German Baroque movement and a keeper of some of the country's oldest traditions, it boasts an enviable array of both cultural and natural diversions that are sure to keep any visitor entertained in between the chugs.\nTo get to the heart of this vibrant city, we spoke to lifelong Münchner Philipp Lahm, the German football legend who captained the German national team when it won the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\"I grew up very sheltered with my family,\" Lahm says. \"[Munich]'s a big city, but it's not too big… And, of course, it shaped my football career because I had a world-class club in my hometown.\"\nWhile tourism has been a source of tension for some European destinations grappling with its nastier side effects, Oktoberfest remains a source of pride for Munich, and – as Lahm notes – it embodies the \"welcoming\" spirit of the city.\nLahm encourages foreigners visiting for Oktoberfest to follow the local traditions – getting the dress code right, for instance, and eschewing the larger tents for the smaller ones favoured by the locals.\nBut he also hopes visitors will venture outside the Theresienwiese – the 42-hectare site where the festival is held – to discover the Bavarian city's full beauty, from its bustling markets and serene parks to the very stadium where Lahm played for more than 10 seasons.\nHere are Lahm's favourite places in his hometown of Munich.\nFor more than 200 years, locals have been convening at Munich's Viktualienmarkt in the city's Aldstadt (medieval ancient quarter) to stock up on fresh produce.\nWhile the city's market used to be held in its neo-Gothic Marienplatz – the Bavarian capital's unmistakeable symbol – it was eventually moved to a nearby square, where the former farmers' hub has now become renowned for its refined gourmet treats.\nIt's also Lahm's first stop for savouring Munich's culture. \"You can get the whole idea of what Munich is about,\" he says.\nThe market's atmosphere is quaint and demure, with small fountains nestled between more than 100 food stalls, selling all manner of local delicacies, from Bavarian cream doughnuts and cheese spreads (Obatzda), to the famed local white sausage (Müncher Weißwurst) – a reputed hangover cure.\n\"There are lots of different stalls,\" Lahm says. \"There are food and drink options, you can buy fruit and vegetables, so it's a lovely atmosphere in the centre of town.\"\nBeer is never far away in Munich, and, at the end of a stroll, you can enjoy a pint or two under the chestnut trees of the market's beer garden, which is open every day from 09:00 to 22:00.\nWebsite: https://www.viktualienmarkt-muenchen.de/en/home/ Address: Viktualienmarkt 3, 80331 Phone number: +49 89 8906 8205 Instagram: @viktualienmarkt_muenchen\nAt the foot of the Bavarian Alps and bordered by lush forests and rolling hills, Munich is a nature-lover's paradise.\nRoughly 7km from the city centre, the Olympic Park – known locally as Olympiapark and inaugurated for the 1972 Olympic Games – serves as a gateway to the city's more bucolic side.\n\"It's a large park,\" says Lahm. \"The roofs are still the same as they used to be, the stands in the indoor swimming pool are still similar to what they were back then, so the Olympic Park is a wonderful place to be active, but also to experience the history of the Olympic Games.\"\nThe park's 60m-tall hill, Olympiaberg, not only offers unparalleled views of its surroundings, but it also has an added perk: it allows park-goers a peek inside the Olympic Stadium.\nOnce a well-kept secret, videos went viral on social media this summer, showing thousands enjoying Taylor Swift and Coldplay concerts for free from the top of the hill.\nBut for the best views of the city and its surroundings, Lahm advises heading up to the top of the TV tower.\n\"From there you simply have a wonderful view over Munich,\" he says. \"You can [even] see the Alps from there.\"\nWebsite: https://www.olympiapark.de/en Address: Spiridon-Louis-Ring 21, 80809 München, Germany Phone: +49 89 3067 2054 Instagram: @olympiapark\nIt would seem unlikely to associate Munich, which is more than 500km from the ocean, with water sports.\nYet, the city's Englischer Garten (English Garden) allows visitors to try their hand at a seemingly unlikely pursuit: surfing.\nThe sprawling, 3.75sq-km English Garden was opened in 1792, and is a testament to the whimsical, romanticist fantasies of the time, peppered with follies, lakes and pagodas. But among its most striking features is the Eisbach (\"ice brook\"), a man-made river with an artificial wave suitable for surfing – making it particularly popular in the dog days of summer.\n\"[There are] the Eisbach surfers in the middle of the city, a small, fantastic wave where lots of people are surfing and there are many spectators,\" says Lahm. \"It's something very special for me in a big city.\"\nWebsite: https://www.englischer-garten-muenchen-infos.de/en/ Address: Englischer Garten 1, 80538 / (Eisbach) Prinzregentenstr 1, 80538 Phone: +49 89 3866 6390\nWhile Munich might be more typically associated with the colourful folklore of its centuries-old traditions, it is also one of Europe's economic motors and a hub of innovation. So for those travelling to Munich with little ones – yes, the Munich Oktoberfest is proudly kid-friendly – Lahm suggests taking a detour to the Deutsches Museum for an enriching, family-oriented educational experience.\n\"Children can be active there, but of course [you can] experience a lot of the history and everything about Germany,\" he says.\nOpened in 1903 on Museuminsel (Munich's \"Museum Island\"), the Deutsches Museum is the world's biggest science and technology museum. Its colossal collection of more than 28,000 items is housed in four separate buildings, and visitors can explore its 20 permanent exhibits ranging from astronautics to robotics to historical transportation; a welcome distraction from Oktoberfest's noisier shenanigans.\nWebsite: https://www.deutsches-museum.de Address: Museumsinsel 1, 80538 Phone number: +49 89 2179 333 Instagram: @deutschesmuseum\nSomething of a pilgrimage site for football fans since its opening in 2005, Munich's Allianz Arena is no regular stadium.

{"doc_id": 31, "question": "What was the nickname given to the restored Ecce Homo painting by the Spanish media?", "answer": ["Ecce Mono"], "doc": "As travellers increasingly follow social media feeds and internet memes, the most unlikely of things can become tourist attractions.\nThe docent said she wanted to take our photo. \"To send it to Cecelia in order to let her know what a good thing she did,\" said the woman. \"That people are now coming to this small town in Spain because of her 'mistake'.\" \nI was in Borja, a 5,000-person town in Spain's northern Aragon province. It was here that in 2012, an elderly parishioner and amateur art restorer named Cecilia Giménez captured the world's attention when she chose to touch up a fresco of Jesus Christ titled Ecce Homo in the Santuario de Misericordia church that had deteriorated since it was painted in the 1930s. Giménez had originally proposed to just add some colouring to Jesus' clothing. But as the 81-year-old was working on it, she couldn't help herself: she began repainting the face.\nWhen she took a break from her duties to go on holiday, she returned to find crowds of shocked people and a horde of international press at the church. The restoration looked so different that local authorities initially assumed the painting had been vandalised. Yet, it was just the (unfinished) work of Giménez, who thought she could restore the painting to its former glory.\nInstead, Ecce Homo (\"Behold the Man\" in Latin) was rebranded \"Ecce Mono\" (\"Behold the Monkey\") by the Spanish media. At first this seemed like an art tragedy. The image of the \"Monkey Christ\", as the English-language press deemed it, was all over the internet. Memes were created. Social media mocked it to death. And Giménez became a hermit in her home, stricken with grief from all the ridicule it caused.\nBut then something interesting happened: tourists started turning up in Borja. This small town that had previously welcomed just 5,000 visitors per year suddenly had a surge of travellers coming to see the botched restoration of Ecce Homo. Today, officials say that between 15,000 and 20,000 tourists per year flock to Borja to see the famous flub of a portrait, which is now, like the Mona Lisa and other masterpieces of the art world, behind a protective shield of glass.\nOn a recent trip with my Spanish-born wife to visit her family in the nearby city of Zaragoza, I suggested we take a daytrip to Borja to see the simian saviour. My sister-and-law and her daughter looked at me for a moment before one of them uttered, \"Why would you want to see that?\"\nEver since I saw the post-restoration image of Ecce Homo, I was fascinated by it. I couldn't explain why, but I wanted to see it with my own eyes. Like so many seemingly random things these days, it had become an unlikely tourist attraction.\nIn his book The Tourist: A New Theory of the Leisure Class, sociologist Dean MacCannell writes: \"anything is potentially a [tourist] attraction. It simply awaits one person to take the trouble to point out to another something noteworthy or worth seeing … Sometimes we have official guides and travelogues to assist us in this pointing.\" But more and more often, social media feeds now serve as our travel guides, pointing tourists towards things like unassuming rural villages, quirky roadside attractions and far-flung art installations.\nIn fact, the story of the Ecce Homo is a perfect example of what MacCannell believes motivates many modern travellers to get on a plane or train in the first place: \"All tourists embody a quest for authenticity,\" he writes.\nIn a way, the botched Ecce Homo is as authentic as it gets: a genuine, real thing born from a mistake. And as I was about to find out, that's part of the painting's appeal.\nAn hour and 70km after leaving Zaragoza, we were in the sleepy, medieval centre of Borja. The Santuario de Misericordia is located roughly 5km away and up a hill from town's central plaza. After paying a €3 entrance fee, the docent led us into the chapel and there it was: the \"Monkey Christ\". As we lingered, a dozen or so other tourists arrived to see the monkey messiah.\n\"MoMA in New York was interested in purchasing it at one time,\" the docent told us. \"But it would have caused too much structural damage to move it from the building.\"\nGiménez \"was devastated by the response to her 'mistake',\" the docent added, using air quotes with her hands. \"And that's why we've been trying to convince her that she has actually done a very positive thing for the community. She put Borja on the tourist map.\" She then pointed to a map of the world tacked to the wall. Hundreds of pins were stuck into spots on the globe where visitors have come from to see Ecce Homo. There were so many over North America, Europe, and Japan that you could no longer see country outlines, just the pin heads. In all, visitors from 110 countries have now come to see it.\nWith Ecce Homo now behind glass and a gift shop at the exit, the church in Borja has a staged, ready-for-tourism aspect to it. As we walked toward the exit, we passed through a gift shop selling Ecce Homo-branded coffee mugs, mousepads, keychains, tote bags, wine bottles and T-shirts. There was a machine making a bronze coin with the image of the so-called Monkey Christ. In an adjacent room, an \"Interpretation Centre\" displayed works of art inspired by Giménez's restoration, including a photo of someone dressed in an Ecce Homo costume for Halloween and several paintings attempting to recreate the scene of Giménez restoring the fresco.  \nThere was even a photo stand-in, in which you can put your face in the hole and have a photo of yourself as Ecce Homo. My wife (then girlfriend), Ivana, and I both did it and used the photo as part of our wedding invitation a year later.\nMore like this:• The town that banned influencers • Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers • How a viral ad campaign is teaching us to \"life-see\" not sightsee\nWhen I asked MacCannel why he thought the Ecce Homo had become a tourist attraction, he had a unique take on it, saying that the original artwork, when it was in pristine condition, had previously garnered almost zero attention. \"The pre-botched fresco was understandably not a reason for tourists to visit the church – probably not much a component of the motivation of the devout to visit.\"\nBut by commodifying Ecce Homo and turning this uniquely botched restoration into just another tourist attraction with entrance fees, crowds and selfie-posing visitors, I couldn't help but wonder whether the powers that be in Borja risked squandering the unique appeal and authenticity of the painting itself – the very reason that led me to visit it in the first place. Perhaps that was inevitable, and as I would soon learn, this has had a few positive effects too.\nSince the church began charging visitors a €3 entrance fee and selling souvenirs in 2016, the proceeds have funded new jobs at the church (such as the docent's) and a large portion is donated to the retirement home where Giménez now lives.\nA few other unexpected things have happened since the painting became a tourist attraction, including an increased interest in Giménez's artwork. Shortly after the revelations of the botched Ecce Homo, one of her own paintings sold at a charity auction for $1,400.\nAccording to one article in the Spanish press, for the last few years, Ecce Homo-inspired tourism, image rights and programmes generated €45,000 in 2021 alone for the town of Borja. There's even been an opera written about Giménez and Ecce Homo that premiered in the United States in autumn 2023. When it was performed in Borja a few years earlier, Giménez was in attendance. She loved it.\nAfter leaving the church, we ate lunch at a restaurant in the centre of Borja. Over creamy jamon croquetas (ham croquettes), fried artichokes and glasses of local Garnacha wine – previously the only thing Borja was well-known for – my previously sceptical sister-in-law, Pilar, and her daughter, Ara, made a surprise announcement: they liked our trip to Borja.\n\"I didn't understand why you wanted to see this,\" Pilar said. \"But after hearing about the life of Cecilia and seeing the painting with my own eyes, plus learning about all the people from around the world who want to come here, I totally get it now.\"\nAs Francisco Miguel Arilla, the former mayor of Borja, said to the press: \"In the end, time puts everything in its place.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

Shortly after the revelations of the botched Ecce Homo, one of her own paintings sold at a charity auction for $1,400.\nAccording to one article in the Spanish press, for the last few years, Ecce Homo-inspired tourism, image rights and programmes generated €45,000 in 2021 alone for the town of Borja. There's even been an opera written about Giménez and Ecce Homo that premiered in the United States in autumn 2023. When it was performed in Borja a few years earlier, Giménez was in attendance. She loved it.\nAfter leaving the church, we ate lunch at a restaurant in the centre of Borja. Over creamy jamon croquetas (ham croquettes), fried artichokes and glasses of local Garnacha wine – previously the only thing Borja was well-known for – my previously sceptical sister-in-law, Pilar, and her daughter, Ara, made a surprise announcement: they liked our trip to Borja.\n\"I didn't understand why you wanted to see this,\" Pilar said. \"But after hearing about the life of Cecilia and seeing the painting with my own eyes, plus learning about all the people from around the world who want to come here, I totally get it now.\"\nAs Francisco Miguel Arilla, the former mayor of Borja, said to the press: \"In the end, time puts everything in its place.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

{"doc_id": 33, "question": "Who is considered Asia's best female chef according to the article?", "answer": ["Chef Pam Soontornyanakij"], "doc": "Chef Pam Soontornyanakij is Asia's best female chef, and she loves pad Thai. Here are her picks for the best in Bangkok, from trendy wagyu pad Thai at May Rai to old school Thipsamai.\nFor many visitors to Bangkok, pad Thai – stir-fried rice noodles tossed in a wok with prawn, eggs, peanuts and bean sprouts – acts as the unofficial ambassador to Thailand's vibrant cuisine. But pad Thai wasn't even part of Thai life until the 1930s.\nThe history of stir-fried noodles in Thailand goes back to the Chinese immigrants who introduced rice noodles to the region in the 18th Century. After the end of World War One, military officer Plaek Phibunsongkhram – known as Phibun – led a coup and came to power, ending Thailand's absolute monarchy. While cementing his authority, Phibun aimed to create a strong national identity and modernise the war-ravaged nation to avoid European invasions. So he engineered an economical, filling and nutritious diet, turning to inexpensive Chinese rice noodles and promoted a nationwide \"noodle is your lunch\" campaign, encouraging chefs to make rice noodles more Thai.\n\"Many ingredients in pad Thai like rice noodles belonged to Chinese immigrants. It's very Thai-Chinese,\" says Pam Pichaya Soontornyanakij, a Bangkok-born chef known for her progressive Thai-Chinese cuisine restaurant Potong. \"But it was created to feed the Thai nationality, so people feel more Thai. And it worked.\"\nSince 2002, a \"Global Thai\" campaign to boost Thailand's tourism-heavy economy and the country's image worldwide led to the opening of many Thai restaurants around the globe, leading people overseas to associate pad Thai with Thailand.\nWhile the dish may not have hundreds of years of history, Soontornyanakij says that pad Thai is very cultural. \"I'm proud of pad Thai,\" says Soontornyanakij, who serves a modernised version of the dish at her restaurant, made with shrimp and topped with a Thai flag made of naturally-coloured red, white and blue rice noodles. \"It portrays the struggles and the survival of the Thai people. And it's become a staple today. It represents our landscape, our history.\"\nHere are Soontornyanakij's top picks for pad Thai in Bangkok.\nWhile you can find pad Thai in every nook and cranny across Bangkok, no pad Thai spot is as legendary as Thipsamai.\n\"Everyone usually has the same flavour profile in their pad Thai – sour, salty and sweet – but the magic of pad Thai is the balance of both flavour and texture,\" says Soontornyanakij. Everyone makes pad Thai in their own way, she explains. \"And there's nothing wrong with that, but I love Thipsamai because the noodles are slippery, and not sticky. That means that they add quite a lot of fat.\"\nThipsamai's original version of pad Thai is cooked with softer and tender sen chan noodles from Thailand's Chanthaburi province and prawn oil made to a family recipe – it's the secret to their popularity. The portion of noodles comes enveloped in a thin vellum of egg.\nThere are now several outlets across the city, but Soontornyanakij says that their old town location inside a warmly lit wooden building remains the most iconic. Thipsamai's desire to serve Bangkok residents began nearly a decade ago when a young woman called Samai began selling pad Thai on a boat across one of the city's canals during World War Two. The couple's son Sikarachat Baisamut now continues their legacy.\nWebsite: https://thipsamai.com/Address: 313, 315 Maha Chai Rd, Samran Rat, Phra Nakhon, Bangkok 10200Phone: +66 2 226 6666Instagram: @thipsamaipadThai\nIt's no mean feat to be a groovy hangout in a buzzing megapolis that doubles as a culinary hub. But that's exactly what May Rai is, says Soontornyanakij. Housed in an intimate, neon-lit shophouse in Bangkok's old town overlooking the gleaming Wat Arun temple along the Chao Phraya River, this part-wine bar, part-pad Thai spot is \"quite the contrast\", she says. \"You are going to eat pad Thai in a funky wine bar.\"\nMichelin-starred Thai chef Thitid Tassanakajohn – who's known as chef Ton – runs the restaurant with his brother and serves natural wines from across the world and homemade spirits infused with herbs. Then there's the food menu serving Thai dishes and the bar's fusion pad Thai inspired by their grandmother's dishes – including a pad Thai made of local wagyu.\n\"I went there when it opened, and it's warm, cosy and casual. Chef Ton really didn't promote it a lot so you can say it's still kind of hidden,\" Soontornyanakij says. Pad Thai is usually served with lime, chilli and other condiments on the side to add on as you prefer, \"but he [chef Ton] has it already seasoned for you\".\nAddress: 22 Tha Suphan Alley, Phra Borom Maha Ratchawang, Phra Nakhon, Bangkok 10200Phone: +66 97 293 5549Instagram: @mayraibkk\nAlthough it's not usually eaten on the go, pad Thai is a popular street food sold by small stalls across Bangkok. And for generations, Pad Thai Ratchawong stall, located near the city's Yaowarat area, has been known for serving up the best traditional pad Thai. Bangkok locals are loyal to this spot, Soontornyanakij says.\n\"You usually get very good pad Thai in Yaowarat. That's mostly because it's home to many Thai-Chinese families,\" Soontornyanakij says.\nIndeed, the lively Yaowarat Road that hustles and bustles is the hub of Chinese arts and crafts in Bangkok. It's also part of the world's largest Chinatown. Since Pad Thai is prepared in a wok, Soontornyanakij says it was all done by Chinese immigrants first and passed down to the next generations. \"So even in the most random places, pad Thai here is top-notch.\"\nAt Ratchawong, you can grab one of their rickety plastic stools or take pad Thai home in a small banana leaf basket called a krathong. The noodles here are subtly crumbly with a generous amount of fresh prawn. \"This place is very iconic for people in Chinatown, and locals trust it for their sweet and spicy pad Thai with the aroma of the wok,\" Soontornyanakij says.\nAddress: 136 Ratchawong Rd, Chakkrawat, Samphanthawong, Bangkok 10100Phone: +6681 253 5961\nIn 2023, Bangkok received more than 28 million visitors, but even in this tourist-popular city, there are many spots known only to locals, like Lueng Pha Pad Thai.

{"doc_id": 33, "question": "What is the name of the restaurant run by Chef Pam Soontornyanakij that serves a modernized version of pad Thai?", "answer": ["Potong"], "doc": "Chef Pam Soontornyanakij is Asia's best female chef, and she loves pad Thai. Here are her picks for the best in Bangkok, from trendy wagyu pad Thai at May Rai to old school Thipsamai.\nFor many visitors to Bangkok, pad Thai – stir-fried rice noodles tossed in a wok with prawn, eggs, peanuts and bean sprouts – acts as the unofficial ambassador to Thailand's vibrant cuisine. But pad Thai wasn't even part of Thai life until the 1930s.\nThe history of stir-fried noodles in Thailand goes back to the Chinese immigrants who introduced rice noodles to the region in the 18th Century. After the end of World War One, military officer Plaek Phibunsongkhram – known as Phibun – led a coup and came to power, ending Thailand's absolute monarchy. While cementing his authority, Phibun aimed to create a strong national identity and modernise the war-ravaged nation to avoid European invasions. So he engineered an economical, filling and nutritious diet, turning to inexpensive Chinese rice noodles and promoted a nationwide \"noodle is your lunch\" campaign, encouraging chefs to make rice noodles more Thai.\n\"Many ingredients in pad Thai like rice noodles belonged to Chinese immigrants. It's very Thai-Chinese,\" says Pam Pichaya Soontornyanakij, a Bangkok-born chef known for her progressive Thai-Chinese cuisine restaurant Potong. \"But it was created to feed the Thai nationality, so people feel more Thai. And it worked.\"\nSince 2002, a \"Global Thai\" campaign to boost Thailand's tourism-heavy economy and the country's image worldwide led to the opening of many Thai restaurants around the globe, leading people overseas to associate pad Thai with Thailand.\nWhile the dish may not have hundreds of years of history, Soontornyanakij says that pad Thai is very cultural. \"I'm proud of pad Thai,\" says Soontornyanakij, who serves a modernised version of the dish at her restaurant, made with shrimp and topped with a Thai flag made of naturally-coloured red, white and blue rice noodles. \"It portrays the struggles and the survival of the Thai people. And it's become a staple today. It represents our landscape, our history.\"\nHere are Soontornyanakij's top picks for pad Thai in Bangkok.\nWhile you can find pad Thai in every nook and cranny across Bangkok, no pad Thai spot is as legendary as Thipsamai.\n\"Everyone usually has the same flavour profile in their pad Thai – sour, salty and sweet – but the magic of pad Thai is the balance of both flavour and texture,\" says Soontornyanakij. Everyone makes pad Thai in their own way, she explains. \"And there's nothing wrong with that, but I love Thipsamai because the noodles are slippery, and not sticky. That means that they add quite a lot of fat.\"\nThipsamai's original version of pad Thai is cooked with softer and tender sen chan noodles from Thailand's Chanthaburi province and prawn oil made to a family recipe – it's the secret to their popularity. The portion of noodles comes enveloped in a thin vellum of egg.\nThere are now several outlets across the city, but Soontornyanakij says that their old town location inside a warmly lit wooden building remains the most iconic. Thipsamai's desire to serve Bangkok residents began nearly a decade ago when a young woman called Samai began selling pad Thai on a boat across one of the city's canals during World War Two. The couple's son Sikarachat Baisamut now continues their legacy.\nWebsite: https://thipsamai.com/Address: 313, 315 Maha Chai Rd, Samran Rat, Phra Nakhon, Bangkok 10200Phone: +66 2 226 6666Instagram: @thipsamaipadThai\nIt's no mean feat to be a groovy hangout in a buzzing megapolis that doubles as a culinary hub. But that's exactly what May Rai is, says Soontornyanakij. Housed in an intimate, neon-lit shophouse in Bangkok's old town overlooking the gleaming Wat Arun temple along the Chao Phraya River, this part-wine bar, part-pad Thai spot is \"quite the contrast\", she says. \"You are going to eat pad Thai in a funky wine bar.\"\nMichelin-starred Thai chef Thitid Tassanakajohn – who's known as chef Ton – runs the restaurant with his brother and serves natural wines from across the world and homemade spirits infused with herbs.

Chef Ton really didn't promote it a lot so you can say it's still kind of hidden,\" Soontornyanakij says.

And for generations, Pad Thai Ratchawong stall, located near the city's Yaowarat area, has been known for serving up the best traditional pad Thai. Bangkok locals are loyal to this spot, Soontornyanakij says.\n\"You usually get very good pad Thai in Yaowarat. That's mostly because it's home to many Thai-Chinese families,\" Soontornyanakij says.\nIndeed, the lively Yaowarat Road that hustles and bustles is the hub of Chinese arts and crafts in Bangkok. It's also part of the world's largest Chinatown. Since Pad Thai is prepared in a wok, Soontornyanakij says it was all done by Chinese immigrants first and passed down to the next generations. \"So even in the most random places, pad Thai here is top-notch.\"\nAt Ratchawong, you can grab one of their rickety plastic stools or take pad Thai home in a small banana leaf basket called a krathong. The noodles here are subtly crumbly with a generous amount of fresh prawn. \"This place is very iconic for people in Chinatown, and locals trust it for their sweet and spicy pad Thai with the aroma of the wok,\" Soontornyanakij says.\nAddress: 136 Ratchawong Rd, Chakkrawat, Samphanthawong, Bangkok 10100Phone: +6681 253 5961\nIn 2023, Bangkok received more than 28 million visitors, but even in this tourist-popular city, there are many spots known only to locals, like Lueng Pha Pad Thai.

{"doc_id": 34, "question": "When is the Stockholm Archipelago Trail scheduled to open to the public?", "answer": ["October 2024"], "doc": "When it opens to the public in October 2024, the Stockholm Archipelago Trail will link 21 islands and give Stockholm-bound visitors easy access to the nation's exquisite nature.\nOn my first boat trip out into the Stockholm Archipelago, the colour palette was vivid. The mirror-like shimmer of the labyrinthine sund (straits) divided up the green of densely forested islands, whose boulder-strewn shores were weathered to the hue of white gold. Fairy tale-like rust-red cabins peeped out of the trees or perched atop rocks. As my boat passed one such stretch of coast, another quickly hove into view, stretching to one horizon and then the next. This idyllic group of 30,000-odd isles and islets comprises one of the world’s largest archipelagos, with five times the number of Greek islands.   \nI was here to hike the newly created Stockholm Archipelago Trail (SAT), which opens to the public in October 2024. Connecting the archipelago from Arholma island at its northern end to Oja in the far south by waymarked paths for the first time – and becoming one of the world's only archipelagos to be linked end-to-end by trail – the SAT will open up the islands to the public like never before. \nWhile the archipelago has been long used for leisure by boaters and beachgoers, the establishment of the 270km SAT sends the message out loud and clear that these islands are perfect for deeper exploration by foot. The route will run across 21 islands representative of the archipelago's abundant natural beauty, and in so doing will also showcase the need to protect its fragile ecosystems.  \n\"We want to encourage everyone to walk here to raise the profile of the islands,\" said SAT creator Michael Lemmel. \"Many people already come, but often use the islands in particular ways. For example, it is popular to visit by private boat, but those who do so will likely travel no more than 50m inland from the boat dock. The SAT [will] spread visitors out over a wider area than just, say, a marina.\"\nLemmel and other proponents of the SAT believe the archipelago – a 1,700-sq-km span of tree-carpeted islands and rocky islets edged by sandy beaches and etched by skerry-peppered bays – has huge potential to redistribute the Stockholm region's influx of tourists more evenly. \"The archipelago tourism window is very specific: an eight-week boom from late June to August and almost nothing the rest of the year,\" Lemmel said – but the walking season extends from May to September or October, meaning the route will take pressure off hotspots and peak visiting times.\nDespite the archipelago being a regional highlight, a 2022 Visit Stockholm survey found that while 81% of overseas visitors to Stockholm sightsee in the city, only 26% take a boat ride out to see its islands. And there is so much to see and do there: basking on the beaches of Sandhamn and Nåttarö; kayaking across island-speckled bays; relaxing in remote cabins where views of sea, sky, forest and birdlife loom large through the windows; and, above all, soaking up the pervading sense of tranquillity that's harder to find elsewhere in the vicinity.\nVisitors cannot bring cars across to the islands the SAT traverses, boats can only dock at certain points and the route is unsuitable for bikes, which makes walking the best way of getting around, whether that's for adventurers keen to trek the entire island-to-island route or more leisurely outdoor-lovers wanting to walk just the stages that appeal to them. Paths have been made welcoming with impeccable signage and strategically placed benches to take in the view. At the same time, the SAT's own environmental impact is negligible. Waymarks (blue for the sea, yellow for the sand) are attached to trees on removable bands so as not to permanently scar the trunk and the route follows pre-existing human and animal paths so new ones did not need to be cut.\n\"Making the trail is also a means for people vested in protecting the islands to subsist on the archipelago for much of the year,\" added Marie Östblom from the Stockholm Business Region, which is overseeing the trail's implementation. \"Walkers will spur extra demand for sub-businesses like lodgings and localised tours. Most islands have few residents, so making important decisions about everything, conservation included, then becomes more efficient.\"\nIn six days, I was able to hike the SAT across six islands – Finnhamn, Grinda, Sandhamn, Utö, Alö and Nåttarö – taking in more than a quarter of the entire route. So numerous are the islands and so thick the forest cover on most that locals say the only sure way to identify somewhere from the water is by the shape of its trees – but when I was on them, I found each island possessed distinctive traits.\nFinnhamn is the only archipelago island with oak trees, and huge rocky outcrops burst out of its forest floor, making for a thrilling hike. Grinda is a gentler mixture of forest and agricultural land. Both are nature reserves. Sandhamn is the most touristed island, yet the sandy pine forests stippling its south and west sides are serene and exquisite. Neighbouring Utö and the Ålö-Rånö nature reserve ratchet up the drama with deep skerry-strewn inlets and higher elevations that set up the archipelago’s finest panoramas. Meanwhile Nåttarö’s pine and birch fringed white sand beaches are unparalleled, and the island has become one of Sweden's first marine nature reserves.\n\"We want to bring people out here to see these treasures for themselves,\" Lemmel said. \"It's harder to care about conserving the islands without appreciating what they offer, and right now even Stockholmers don't know so much about them. We've got thousands of islands – some also on the SAT – that are wildernesses, within a short boat ride of a capital city. How many places can say that?\"\nDespite their natural beauty and their status as a wildlife bastion for seabirds, including Sweden's most significant sea eagle population, the archipelago is vulnerable to pollution. Its intricate web of waterways means polluted water from the Baltic Sea and from over-fertilisation in the Swedish river system can get trapped here. But this has often meant the archipelago has become a drawing board for developing long-term solutions to ecological threats. \nOn Utö, the SAT emerges from forest to encircle a man-made wetland home to a seminal scheme that, according to its creator Thomas Hjelm, can rejuvenate sea life across the entire Baltic. Through introducing top-level predator fish that had been fished to near-extinction like pike and perch and releasing them into the sea through the wetland, he has created a self-sustaining circulatory system. This decontaminates water within the fish's swimming radius of about eight kilometres, as these predator fish reduce algae levels. Wetland reeds grow quickly, too. When cut, Hjelm told me, they can make a viable alternative for fertiliser without the CO2 that turf-cutting, the standard means of creating fertiliser, releases.  \n\"This wetland is the blueprint to show others how it can be done,\" said Hjelm. \"But several hundred of these around the Baltic seaboard would make a massive improvement.\" \nThe Sandhamn section of the trail is the busiest due to the popularity of the island's pretty port and beach. One of Sandhamn's main hotel owners, Lena Josefsson of Sandhamn Seglarhotel, told me that offering a sustainable travel experience was more challenging on the archipelago because of how basic services – recycling facilities and larger supermarkets, for example – were often located a boat ride away on the mainland. \nMore like this:• An award-winning 1,400km hike into the wilds of Eastern Europe• A new chance to hike Europe's ancient salt route• France's centuries-old mountain farm stays\n\"We've come up with a few schemes,\" she said. \"We've just started to get all the food waste from our restaurant collected and made into fertiliser. Also, we're opening an off-grid retreat on a lighthouse offshore from Sandhamn. We hope this will attract a different type of guest, one with a lower carbon footprint.\"    \nAs I walked the SAT, I took Lemmel's point about needing to see the archipelago to care about its ecological value. \"Amazon\" and \"Arctic\" are environmental trigger words: the Stockholm Archipelago is currently not. And this is what the trail does: it lets visitors experience the wonder of the trees giving way to a serendipitous beach or a silent inlet thronged by eider ducks; and, more importantly, it makes them think about why these things are so precious.\n\"And now is the best time to come,\" smiled Östblom. \"Late August to October is our magic season. The summer crowds are gone but the water remains several degrees warmer than on the Swedish mainland.\"\nAnd after six days of rugged hiking on the SAT, the water did look extremely inviting: millpond calm and tinged by golden autumn light. So in I jumped.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

The route will run across 21 islands representative of the archipelago's abundant natural beauty, and in so doing will also showcase the need to protect its fragile ecosystems.  \n\"We want to encourage everyone to walk here to raise the profile of the islands,\" said SAT creator Michael Lemmel. \"Many people already come, but often use the islands in particular ways. For example, it is popular to visit by private boat, but those who do so will likely travel no more than 50m inland from the boat dock. The SAT [will] spread visitors out over a wider area than just, say, a marina.\"\nLemmel and other proponents of the SAT believe the archipelago – a 1,700-sq-km span of tree-carpeted islands and rocky islets edged by sandy beaches and etched by skerry-peppered bays – has huge potential to redistribute the Stockholm region's influx of tourists more evenly. \"The archipelago tourism window is very specific: an eight-week boom from late June to August and almost nothing the rest of the year,\" Lemmel said – but the walking season extends from May to September or October, meaning the route will take pressure off hotspots and peak visiting times.\nDespite the archipelago being a regional highlight, a 2022 Visit Stockholm survey found that while 81% of overseas visitors to Stockholm sightsee in the city, only 26% take a boat ride out to see its islands. And there is so much to see and do there: basking on the beaches of Sandhamn and Nåttarö; kayaking across island-speckled bays; relaxing in remote cabins where views of sea, sky, forest and birdlife loom large through the windows; and, above all, soaking up the pervading sense of tranquillity that's harder to find elsewhere in the vicinity.\nVisitors cannot bring cars across to the islands the SAT traverses, boats can only dock at certain points and the route is unsuitable for bikes, which makes walking the best way of getting around, whether that's for adventurers keen to trek the entire island-to-island route or more leisurely outdoor-lovers wanting to walk just the stages that appeal to them. Paths have been made welcoming with impeccable signage and strategically placed benches to take in the view. At the same time, the SAT's own environmental impact is negligible. Waymarks (blue for the sea, yellow for the sand) are attached to trees on removable bands so as not to permanently scar the trunk and the route follows pre-existing human and animal paths so new ones did not need to be cut.\n\"Making the trail is also a means for people vested in protecting the islands to subsist on the archipelago for much of the year,\" added Marie Östblom from the Stockholm Business Region, which is overseeing the trail's implementation. \"Walkers will spur extra demand for sub-businesses like lodgings and localised tours. Most islands have few residents, so making important decisions about everything, conservation included, then becomes more efficient.\"\nIn six days, I was able to hike the SAT across six islands – Finnhamn, Grinda, Sandhamn, Utö, Alö and Nåttarö – taking in more than a quarter of the entire route. So numerous are the islands and so thick the forest cover on most that locals say the only sure way to identify somewhere from the water is by the shape of its trees – but when I was on them, I found each island possessed distinctive traits.\nFinnhamn is the only archipelago island with oak trees, and huge rocky outcrops burst out of its forest floor, making for a thrilling hike. Grinda is a gentler mixture of forest and agricultural land. Both are nature reserves. Sandhamn is the most touristed island, yet the sandy pine forests stippling its south and west sides are serene and exquisite. Neighbouring Utö and the Ålö-Rånö nature reserve ratchet up the drama with deep skerry-strewn inlets and higher elevations that set up the archipelago’s finest panoramas. Meanwhile Nåttarö’s pine and birch fringed white sand beaches are unparalleled, and the island has become one of Sweden's first marine nature reserves.\n\"We want to bring people out here to see these treasures for themselves,\" Lemmel said. \"It's harder to care about conserving the islands without appreciating what they offer, and right now even Stockholmers don't know so much about them. We've got thousands of islands – some also on the SAT – that are wildernesses, within a short boat ride of a capital city. How many places can say that?\"\nDespite their natural beauty and their status as a wildlife bastion for seabirds, including Sweden's most significant sea eagle population, the archipelago is vulnerable to pollution. Its intricate web of waterways means polluted water from the Baltic Sea and from over-fertilisation in the Swedish river system can get trapped here. But this has often meant the archipelago has become a drawing board for developing long-term solutions to ecological threats. \nOn Utö, the SAT emerges from forest to encircle a man-made wetland home to a seminal scheme that, according to its creator Thomas Hjelm, can rejuvenate sea life across the entire Baltic. Through introducing top-level predator fish that had been fished to near-extinction like pike and perch and releasing them into the sea through the wetland, he has created a self-sustaining circulatory system. This decontaminates water within the fish's swimming radius of about eight kilometres, as these predator fish reduce algae levels. Wetland reeds grow quickly, too. When cut, Hjelm told me, they can make a viable alternative for fertiliser without the CO2 that turf-cutting, the standard means of creating fertiliser, releases.  \n\"This wetland is the blueprint to show others how it can be done,\" said Hjelm. \"But several hundred of these around the Baltic seaboard would make a massive improvement.\" \nThe Sandhamn section of the trail is the busiest due to the popularity of the island's pretty port and beach. One of Sandhamn's main hotel owners, Lena Josefsson of Sandhamn Seglarhotel, told me that offering a sustainable travel experience was more challenging on the archipelago because of how basic services – recycling facilities and larger supermarkets, for example – were often located a boat ride away on the mainland. \nMore like this:• An award-winning 1,400km hike into the wilds of Eastern Europe• A new chance to hike Europe's ancient salt route• France's centuries-old mountain farm stays\n\"We've come up with a few schemes,\" she said. \"We've just started to get all the food waste from our restaurant collected and made into fertiliser.

Currently more than 300 businesses are listed as Autism-Certified Centres, as well as three fully certified destinations, though there are a few more currently in the process of becoming certified, including Dubai and the Greater Palm Springs area in the US.\n\"We incorporate best practices from experts in the field, as well as autistic and neurodivergent individuals themselves [in our trainings],\" Meredith Tekin, president of IBCCES, told the BBC. \"So, you'll see individuals sharing their lived experience and sharing their recommendations in the trainings.\"\nIBCCES offers trainings focused on sensory awareness and general sensitivity towards autistic people.

{"doc_id": 37, "question": "How long did the period of the Lithuanian language ban last under Russian rule?", "answer": ["39 years, from 1865 to 1904"], "doc": "For nearly 40 years, daring smugglers transported nearly 40,000 Lithuanian-language books into the nation each year when it was forbidden under Russian rule.\nFollowing the gentle bends of the Nemunas, Lithuania's largest river, the Panemunė road stretches for more than 100km and marks the former border between Lithuania and East Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Considered the most romantic road in Lithuania by locals, it travels past a series of 17th-Century castles, Renaissance-era mansions and postcard-worthy towns.\nYet, the route is perhaps best known as the site of a remarkable movement that took place in the late 19th Century and helped save Lithuanian, which is commonly considered the world's oldest surviving Indo-European language.\nPanemunė was built in the early 13th Century along a chain of early medieval fortresses and castles designed to protect the Grand duchy of Lithuania from the invading Teutonic forces coming from Prussia. By the 1800s, it had developed into a major trade and travel route as the fortresses became mansions for the nobility, and smaller towns grew around them.\nAmong the road's many regal attractions are the Castle of Panemunė, a 17th-Century manor complete with intricate frescoes and a park with cascading ponds that's been transformed into a lavish hotel and artist residence. Ten kilometres east of the castle, Raudone (\"The Red Castle\") is a 16th-Century fortress that was partially destroyed during World War Two but has since been rebuilt and now offers horseback riding, archery lessons and a weekly food and arts fair.\nA further 20km east, the ancient city of Veliuona and the castle hill of Seredzius come into view, where a 30-minute hike up the wooden steps to the top of the lush green hill reveals sweeping views of the Nemunas river below. As the road unfurls in one final sweeping bend before the city of Kaunas, the towers of the Raudondvaris Castle emerge. Built where the Nemunas and Nevezis rivers meet, this sprawling 17th-Century estate now features a concert hall, labyrinth park, museum and a restaurant.\n\"The Panemunė road is often called the 'paradise road' in Lithuania: it boasts exceptional scenery, rich history and countless cultural experiences ranging from the [Honey Valley]; boat trips along River Nemunas; [and] local dandelion wine tastings; to art and history museums, food fairs and cultural events in the Renaissance mansions along the road,\" said Eglė Speičienė, founder of the local travel agency TavoGidas. Because of the many castles, rolling hills and boutique wineries located along the Panemunė, Speičienė says some travellers liken the road to France's famed Loire Valley.\nHowever, stunning scenery and dreamy castles aren't the only thing Panemunė is known for. The road is also where a unique Lithuanian movement took place in the late 19th Century that would help shape the nation's character: book smuggling.\nFrom 1865 to 1904, the Lithuanian language (which is actually related to ancient Sanskrit and diverged thousands of years ago) was banned under the tsarist Russian rule, which controlled large swathes of the country at the time. The ban prohibited the printing, possessing and distributing of any publications in Lithuanian with the Latin alphabet – but instead of creating a complete Russification of the country, it had the opposite effect.\nA large network of resistance publishers, book smugglers and distributors sprang up and more than three million books, scientific papers, textbooks and newspapers were printed in Lithuanian in East Prussia and the US, which each had large populations of Lithuanian émigrés. According to historian Vytautas Merkys, during this 39-year-period more than 40,000 Lithuanian-language publications were smuggled into the country each year, reaching villages, parishes and towns across the nation via the Panemunė road.\nPanemunė's proximity to both East Prussia and Poland, (where the books entered) helped it serve as an entry point into the nation for book-smugglers. Tilžė (now Sovetsk, Kaliningrad) was one of the main points where smugglers crossed, and the road's final point, the city of Kaunas, served as Lithuania's capital from 1919 to 1940 and was a centre for cultural resistance against the Russians.\n\"Essentially, Panemunė was the main artery through which the Lithuanian printed press and books reached the country. River Nemunas was a crucial point for crossing into the country. Some book smugglers swam across, carrying bundled-up books on their bodies, while some transported books hidden in steamboats or paid merchants to help,\" explained Vaidas Banys, a historian and educator. \"[These] banned books, newspapers and religious texts reached deep into the country.\"\nAccording to Banys, these book smugglers were key to saving the Lithuanian language. They frequently carried up to 80lbs of printed Lithuanian books and other publications, smuggling them from East Prussia and other border locations across the Nemunas river, then transporting them along the backroads of Panemunė in horse-drawn carts hidden among stacks of hay, furniture or even empty coffins.\n\"All routes were intricately connected, and no book smuggler worked alone. It wasn't just the person who smuggled the books across the border or carried them on their bodies.

{"doc_id": 37, "question": "How many Lithuanian-language publications were estimated to be smuggled into the country each year during the language ban?", "answer": ["More than 40,000"], "doc": "For nearly 40 years, daring smugglers transported nearly 40,000 Lithuanian-language books into the nation each year when it was forbidden under Russian rule.\nFollowing the gentle bends of the Nemunas, Lithuania's largest river, the Panemunė road stretches for more than 100km and marks the former border between Lithuania and East Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Considered the most romantic road in Lithuania by locals, it travels past a series of 17th-Century castles, Renaissance-era mansions and postcard-worthy towns.\nYet, the route is perhaps best known as the site of a remarkable movement that took place in the late 19th Century and helped save Lithuanian, which is commonly considered the world's oldest surviving Indo-European language.\nPanemunė was built in the early 13th Century along a chain of early medieval fortresses and castles designed to protect the Grand duchy of Lithuania from the invading Teutonic forces coming from Prussia. By the 1800s, it had developed into a major trade and travel route as the fortresses became mansions for the nobility, and smaller towns grew around them.\nAmong the road's many regal attractions are the Castle of Panemunė, a 17th-Century manor complete with intricate frescoes and a park with cascading ponds that's been transformed into a lavish hotel and artist residence. Ten kilometres east of the castle, Raudone (\"The Red Castle\") is a 16th-Century fortress that was partially destroyed during World War Two but has since been rebuilt and now offers horseback riding, archery lessons and a weekly food and arts fair.\nA further 20km east, the ancient city of Veliuona and the castle hill of Seredzius come into view, where a 30-minute hike up the wooden steps to the top of the lush green hill reveals sweeping views of the Nemunas river below. As the road unfurls in one final sweeping bend before the city of Kaunas, the towers of the Raudondvaris Castle emerge. Built where the Nemunas and Nevezis rivers meet, this sprawling 17th-Century estate now features a concert hall, labyrinth park, museum and a restaurant.\n\"The Panemunė road is often called the 'paradise road' in Lithuania: it boasts exceptional scenery, rich history and countless cultural experiences ranging from the [Honey Valley]; boat trips along River Nemunas; [and] local dandelion wine tastings; to art and history museums, food fairs and cultural events in the Renaissance mansions along the road,\" said Eglė Speičienė, founder of the local travel agency TavoGidas. Because of the many castles, rolling hills and boutique wineries located along the Panemunė, Speičienė says some travellers liken the road to France's famed Loire Valley.\nHowever, stunning scenery and dreamy castles aren't the only thing Panemunė is known for. The road is also where a unique Lithuanian movement took place in the late 19th Century that would help shape the nation's character: book smuggling.\nFrom 1865 to 1904, the Lithuanian language (which is actually related to ancient Sanskrit and diverged thousands of years ago) was banned under the tsarist Russian rule, which controlled large swathes of the country at the time. The ban prohibited the printing, possessing and distributing of any publications in Lithuanian with the Latin alphabet – but instead of creating a complete Russification of the country, it had the opposite effect.\nA large network of resistance publishers, book smugglers and distributors sprang up and more than three million books, scientific papers, textbooks and newspapers were printed in Lithuanian in East Prussia and the US, which each had large populations of Lithuanian émigrés. According to historian Vytautas Merkys, during this 39-year-period more than 40,000 Lithuanian-language publications were smuggled into the country each year, reaching villages, parishes and towns across the nation via the Panemunė road.\nPanemunė's proximity to both East Prussia and Poland, (where the books entered) helped it serve as an entry point into the nation for book-smugglers.

{"doc_id": 38, "question": "What is the name of the 600-year-old tavern in Bamberg where the author first tried Rauchbier?", "answer": ["Schlenkerla"], "doc": "Every September, millions of tourists flock to Munich for Oktoberfest. However, the true centre of German beer culture lies three hours north in the medieval town of Bamberg.\nThe first time I try Rauchbier (smoke beer) I am sitting in the dimly lit Schlenkerla – a 600-year-old tavern in the heart of Bamberg's old town. A toasty aroma fills the air as if seeping from the ancient wooden beams supporting the low ceiling. I swirl my first sip of the coffee-coloured liquid around in my mouth and my tastebuds explode with notes of slow-roasted ham. The flavour is unusual but palatable; it is like blue cheese, mushrooms or liquorice – either you set it aside after the first bite or feel compelled to keep going. Fortunately, I am in the latter group.\n\"According to an old proverb, you have to drink three Seidlas (half litre) to get used to the taste,\" says Matthias Trum, owner and brewmaster of Schlenkerla, whose family has run the tavern for six generations.\nRauchbier is the signature brew in a city with an unrivalled brewing tradition. While Munich is often thought of as the heart of German beer culture, with millions of tourists descending on the Bavarian capital every year for Oktoberfest, the true centre of German brewing lies in this Unesco-listed medieval town to 230km to the north. Bamberg is a sophisticated and relaxing alternative for beer enthusiasts who prefer quality and variety over sheer quantity.\nUnlike its southern cousin, where six breweries control the production and distribution of beer in and around Munich, Bamberg is home to 10 family-owned breweries within the city centre and 174 in the surrounding Upper Franconia region, producing an estimated 2,500 different beers. With the highest density of breweries found anywhere on the globe, the region lays claim to the unofficial title of \"Beer Capital of the World\".\nAccording to Trum, before the Industrial Revolution, every beer brewed in Northern Europe was a Rauchbier, the result of a malting process that involved drying green malt – barley that has been germinated but not yet dried – in a kiln heated by a beechwood fire. It was only after the first smokeless malt kiln was patented by Sir Nicholas Halse in England on 23 July 1635 that smokeless beers became the new standard and Rauchbier faded into obscurity.\nWhile some craft breweries still produce smoke beer today, there are just two breweries in the world brewing it according to traditional methods with their own malting operations – Schlenkerla and Brauerei Spezial, another Bamberg brewery.\nWhy this tradition survived in Bamberg is unclear. One explanation is economic: the Industrial Revolution started much later in the Germanic states than in England so old brewing methods survived longer. The other is tinged with nostalgia.\nThe walls of Schlenkerla are adorned with sketched city maps and artwork collected by Trum's great-grandfather, Michael Graser, who ran the brewery in the early 20th Century and went to great lengths to maintain the tavern's 14th-Century aesthetic. The art collection, which depicts life in medieval Bamberg, speaks to a spirit of preservation that has been passed down through the generations and continues to influence brewing practices to this day.\n\"Our modern lifestyle goes hand-in-hand with mass production,\" Trum explains. \"This makes our everyday products more affordable, but the result is a natural loss of diversity. It's really sad when flavour diversity is lost, which is why it's important to preserve old flavours.\"\nIn 2017, Rauchbier was added to Slow Food's Ark of Taste, which aims to preserve and raise awareness of culinary traditions in danger of being lost in the modern world. In this spirit, Schlenkerla and Spezial have joined forces every year since 2021 – on 23 July, the day the smokeless kiln was patented – to celebrate Smoke Beer Preservation Day with a programme of events including brewery tours, beer tasting and a Rauchbier-inspired menu.\nWhile Rauchbier is synonymous with Bamberg, the town's other breweries offer many more varieties and specialty brews to suit every taste. \"Not everyone here likes Rauchbier,\" says local tour guide Christine Conrad, who invites me to try a delicious beer-filled truffle in Café am Dom. \"Everyone has their favourite beer and brewery. We are very patriotic about our beer diversity; that's what sets Bamberg apart.\"\nThis diversity is the result of an exception to an ancient law. Across Europe, beer was historically brewed in monasteries and tied to land ownership. However, Bamberg's surrounding villages were not subjected to a so-called Meilenrecht (\"mile right\") – a law imposed by the city authorities that restricted brewing rights within a one-mile radius of the town to a privileged group of brewers – as strictly as in other parts of Europe. The reason for this is simple: they couldn't enforce it.\nDue to Bamberg's location on busy medieval trade routes, beer consumption levels in the region were higher than elsewhere and brewers within the city were unable to cope with demand alone. This gave guesthouse owners in the surrounding areas leverage to ignore the Meilenrecht and sell their own beer. Over time, the number of such establishments grew, which explains to some degree the high density of family-owned breweries in the area and subsequent absence of larger, corporate breweries.\nFor practical reasons, many of these breweries stored their beer in the seven hills surrounding Bamberg. Firstly, the narrow-cobbled streets of the old town were not suitable for transporting large quantities of beer and, more conveniently, early brewers discovered a network of tunnels in the hills created by sandstone quarrying in the Middle Ages. The cool temperatures of the Felsenkeller (rock cellars) were perfect for fermenting and storing beer.\nSome of those breweries opened beer gardens on the hills directly above the rock cellars, giving rise to another unique quirk. In Bamberg, you don't go to the beer garden, you go auf den Kellern (\"on the cellars\"), meaning a leisurely afternoon spent drinking beer under the shade of chestnut trees has the added bonus of spectacular city views.\nIt's deep in the chilled cellars of the Hellerbräu brewery on Stephansberg – one of the seven hills – that I get my second taste of Rauchbier. The taste is cleaner and more familiar this time, a combination of my taste buds adjusting and the fact that the beer has not yet fully matured.\n\"This one needs another week or two,\" says Martin Knab, a retired brewmaster who gives brewery tours in his spare time. As he walks me through the brewery, putting my limited knowledge of the chemical processes and temperatures to the test, I feel a new appreciation for the art of brewing. \"Today we use computers and software to regulate everything according to our knowledge of modern biochemistry; back then, it was all intuition and experience,\" he said. Rather than rejecting modernity altogether, it's about preserving old traditions using modern methods. \nMore like this:• The surprising wellness trend based on beer• From Ancient Egypt to Roman Britain, brewers are reviving beers from the past• Europe's under-the-radar region that's home to the 'undisputed tea world champions'\nBut not all breweries can afford this luxury. Many smaller, family-owned breweries are closing due to a declining interest in the craft. \"Young people are less interested in continuing the family business; they don't want to help grandma roll dumplings every Saturday morning,\" says Nina Schipkowski, director of the Franconian Brewing Museum. \"Another factor is that many brewers have to decide between brewing or gastronomy; they can no longer do both.\"\nThe museum sits on another of Bamberg's hills, on the grounds of the St Michael's Monastery. It was once home to a Benedictine brewery founded in 1122, but in 1979 it was converted into a museum where visitors can learn about Franconian brewing traditions.\nAs I take a tour of through the museum's five levels, I study a map depicting all the breweries that have closed since the turn of the 20th Century – some due to casualties from two World Wars, others due to the effects of modernisation – and I reflect on all the beers and flavours that have been lost. That so many have survived against the odds is another testament to the strong brewing tradition that makes this region so unique. \nThe museum tour ends with a round of beer tasting, starting with a lighter Pils before finishing with a Rauchbier.

In this spirit, Schlenkerla and Spezial have joined forces every year since 2021 – on 23 July, the day the smokeless kiln was patented – to celebrate Smoke Beer Preservation Day with a programme of events including brewery tours, beer tasting and a Rauchbier-inspired menu.\nWhile Rauchbier is synonymous with Bamberg, the town's other breweries offer many more varieties and specialty brews to suit every taste. \"Not everyone here likes Rauchbier,\" says local tour guide Christine Conrad, who invites me to try a delicious beer-filled truffle in Café am Dom. \"Everyone has their favourite beer and brewery. We are very patriotic about our beer diversity; that's what sets Bamberg apart.\"\nThis diversity is the result of an exception to an ancient law. Across Europe, beer was historically brewed in monasteries and tied to land ownership. However, Bamberg's surrounding villages were not subjected to a so-called Meilenrecht (\"mile right\") – a law imposed by the city authorities that restricted brewing rights within a one-mile radius of the town to a privileged group of brewers – as strictly as in other parts of Europe. The reason for this is simple: they couldn't enforce it.\nDue to Bamberg's location on busy medieval trade routes, beer consumption levels in the region were higher than elsewhere and brewers within the city were unable to cope with demand alone. This gave guesthouse owners in the surrounding areas leverage to ignore the Meilenrecht and sell their own beer. Over time, the number of such establishments grew, which explains to some degree the high density of family-owned breweries in the area and subsequent absence of larger, corporate breweries.\nFor practical reasons, many of these breweries stored their beer in the seven hills surrounding Bamberg. Firstly, the narrow-cobbled streets of the old town were not suitable for transporting large quantities of beer and, more conveniently, early brewers discovered a network of tunnels in the hills created by sandstone quarrying in the Middle Ages. The cool temperatures of the Felsenkeller (rock cellars) were perfect for fermenting and storing beer.\nSome of those breweries opened beer gardens on the hills directly above the rock cellars, giving rise to another unique quirk. In Bamberg, you don't go to the beer garden, you go auf den Kellern (\"on the cellars\"), meaning a leisurely afternoon spent drinking beer under the shade of chestnut trees has the added bonus of spectacular city views.\nIt's deep in the chilled cellars of the Hellerbräu brewery on Stephansberg – one of the seven hills – that I get my second taste of Rauchbier. The taste is cleaner and more familiar this time, a combination of my taste buds adjusting and the fact that the beer has not yet fully matured.\n\"This one needs another week or two,\" says Martin Knab, a retired brewmaster who gives brewery tours in his spare time. As he walks me through the brewery, putting my limited knowledge of the chemical processes and temperatures to the test, I feel a new appreciation for the art of brewing. \"Today we use computers and software to regulate everything according to our knowledge of modern biochemistry; back then, it was all intuition and experience,\" he said. Rather than rejecting modernity altogether, it's about preserving old traditions using modern methods. \nMore like this:• The surprising wellness trend based on beer• From Ancient Egypt to Roman Britain, brewers are reviving beers from the past• Europe's under-the-radar region that's home to the 'undisputed tea world champions'\nBut not all breweries can afford this luxury. Many smaller, family-owned breweries are closing due to a declining interest in the craft. \"Young people are less interested in continuing the family business; they don't want to help grandma roll dumplings every Saturday morning,\" says Nina Schipkowski, director of the Franconian Brewing Museum. \"Another factor is that many brewers have to decide between brewing or gastronomy; they can no longer do both.\"\nThe museum sits on another of Bamberg's hills, on the grounds of the St Michael's Monastery. It was once home to a Benedictine brewery founded in 1122, but in 1979 it was converted into a museum where visitors can learn about Franconian brewing traditions.\nAs I take a tour of through the museum's five levels, I study a map depicting all the breweries that have closed since the turn of the 20th Century – some due to casualties from two World Wars, others due to the effects of modernisation – and I reflect on all the beers and flavours that have been lost. That so many have survived against the odds is another testament to the strong brewing tradition that makes this region so unique. \nThe museum tour ends with a round of beer tasting, starting with a lighter Pils before finishing with a Rauchbier. As I savour my third glass, the new taste now as familiar as a Munich Helles, I am comforted by the thought that at least this unique flavour will survive.  \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

{"doc_id": 39, "question": "What is the name of the cabin that Reidunn Botnehagen and her family have created to emulate 19th-century life?", "answer": ["Haukali 333"], "doc": "One family hopes to show people how a return to basic mid 19th-Century life can teach us much about how to care for our environment today.\nThe approach to my accommodation for the night was similar to the ascent into any valley in the Norwegian fjords.

Yet somehow, enfolded in the valley's upper reaches before the increasingly steep gradient precluded the possibility of settlement altogether, I arrived at some gentler, fertile land.\nReidunn Botnehagen's family have farmed this land for more than a century and, like many living amidst south-west Norway's entrancing scenery, also have a countryside cabin here that they rent out to holidaymakers. But Haukali 333, as they've named it, is not just another country escape. This cabin openly celebrates its jettisoning of conventional holiday mod cons in order to emulate the lifestyle of those that first settled in Norway's wilderness nearly two centuries ago.\nAnd her guests, Botnehagen told me, will be all the better for it.\nHaukali 333 is based on the design of a husmannshus or smallholder's cabin. Scattered all over rural Norway, these would have been homes for tenant farmers in the mid-19th Century, who worked on land owned by wealthy landowners and laboured long, gruelling hours to make ends meet. First glamourised by Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen in the late 1800s, in recent decades the husmannshus has became linked with nostalgia for a rural life lost as modern Norwegians increasingly moved to urban areas and a fixation with refurbishing and reinstating them began.\nCabin culture is on a high in Norway with almost 450,000 cabins and holiday homes existing in the country in 2023, according to Statistics Norway – an increase of more than 8% since 2013. These are used year-round by those who crave an escape in nature, with many kitted out to luxurious standards despite a rustic exterior. But Haukali 333 is unique in faithfully recreating the 19th-Century way of life in order to draw attention to a more sustainable way of living.\nIt did not necessarily sound like a premise for a relaxing holiday.\n\"No one is saying that life then was all good,\" Botnehagen smiled. \"But nor was it all bad. We want to show it how it really was, as much as possible. We think the people who come will discover something as a result.\"\nWhen I arrived, the wood-built cabin appeared delightfully rustic, with a turf roof, sky-blue door and window trimmings, sheep grazing its lawn and expansive views out over a mountain-backed lake with just one or two other houses within sight.\nThe mostly candlelit interior had a huge open stone oven, known in 19th-Century Norway as a grue, used as both a cooking and heating source. The wooden seating was pretty to look at, but hard, high-backed and challenging to relax upon. The outdoor shower sprayed water as cool as the spring that supplied it (or I had the option to fill an antique outdoortub with a bucket and wait for the Scandinavian sun to warm it, if I preferred).\nThe beds, accessed by a ladder, were built into the walls head-to-foot as they would have been in the mid-1800s for warmth and covered in fleeces from the Botnehagen family sheep. There was no TV, but 19th-Century evening entertainment in the form of a rokk or spinning wheel for spinning wool into clothes.\nBotnehagen told me I could pick fruit and vegetables (strawberries in July, potatoes in August) from the garden or nearby field, or row a boat out onto the lake with a rod to catch my own dinner. There was also the option to don 19th-Century labourers' garments: only one set, because back then, that would likely have been all a farmer owned.\nThere were a couple of modern-day concessions to comply with health and safety requirements – a toilet and electricity for powering the old kerosene lamp – but visitors looking around from almost any point inside or outside the cabin would see a view akin to that of a mid-19th-Century farm worker.\nMany of Botnehagen's guests appreciate the quirks of living a \"slow life like 1850\", as Haukali 333 describes itself.  \n\"I see it all the time: a fascination with this simple life,\" she said. \"A couple from London last winter just sat outside open-mouthed looking at the brilliance of the stars: light pollution where they live meant they seldom saw them.

She and her husband were preparing land for pasture when they uncovered old stones from the former smallholding.\n\"I remember feeling sad,\" she confided. \"The house and those who lived in it had become forgotten.

{"doc_id": 40, "question": "What is the main ingredient that should never be included in a traditional paella Valenciana according to Chef Ricard Camarena?", "answer": ["Fish"], "doc": "Valencia is the birthplace of paella, and Chef Ricard Camarena knows where to get the real deal. Here are his top picks in his hometown, from Goya Gallery to Napicol.\nOutside Spain, paella – a delicious, saffron-hued mélange of rice, vegetables and meat – is unquestionably the nation's most widely recognised dish. But in sunny Valencia, the birthplace of the beloved recipe, controversy abounds as to what paella actually is.\nBordered by the Mediterranean and surrounded by farmlands, the coastal city of Valencia teems with excellent produce. It's in the fertile Albufera, a nature park 10km from the city, where Valencian farmers are believed to have first added rice to whatever humble ingredients were at hand, then cooked them in a single shallow paella (pan), giving the dish its name. For most Valencians today, one true paella Valenciana exists, while other rice dishes are considered \"rice with things\".\nWe asked Michelin-starred chef Ricard Camarena, a Valencia Community native whose parents and grandmother taught him to cook paella when he was just a boy, what \"real\" paella Valenciana is, and where to get it.\n\"Paella valenciana is a pretty specific recipe,\" says Camarena. \"It should never contain fish; it includes meat and vegetables… The most traditional version includes chicken, rabbit, sometimes snails, flat green beans, garrofó [white] beans, garlic, paprika, saffron and tomato.\"\nNo seafood – really? Well, not technically; while paella shouldn't contain fish, it can have other kinds of seafood. Arroz del señoret, a revered and popular Valencian rice dish with peeled seafood like shrimp and mussels is actually what most die-hard Valencians call seafood paella, whereas the rest of Spain calls seafood with rice \"paella de marisco\". Camarena admits: \"I'm not a purist. To me, seafood paella can be called that because it's cooked in a paella.\"\nBut Camarena doesn't serve any kind of paella at the five restaurants he helms in Valencia: \"Since everyone here has such reverence for paella and we've all had excellent ones, I try to avoid making dishes with traditional references.\"\nHere is where Camarena eats \"real\" paella Valenciana in Valencia.\nOriginally a beach shack that served as a changing room for occasional bathers, Casa Carmela has been managed by the same family since it was founded in 1922. Four generations later, this seaside restaurant now has Toni Novo at the helm, who continues to prepare paella Valenciana the way his great-grandmother Carmen once did.\n\"I would recommend Casa Carmela for a traditional paella Valenciana cooked over a wood fire,\" says Camarena. The arrocería (a restaurant specialising in paella and other rice dishes) uses orange wood to cook its paellas and has an open kitchen for patrons to watch as several paellas cook simultaneously over the fire. \"It's a pretty orthodox paella, sticking to a very traditional and straightforward approach – authentic and much like the kind you’d find in a private home, made with a similar method,\" says Camarena. \"It has that authentic, rustic and robust feel to it.\"\nAveraging about 25 wood-fired paellas per service, the paellas at Casa Carmela are always set in the middle of the table for diners to share and served with a wooden spoon – the traditional way of enjoying the dish.\nWebsite: https://www.casa-carmela.comAddress: C/ d'Isabel de Villena, 155, Poblats Marítims, 46011 València, ValenciaPhone: +34 963 71 00 73Instagram: @casacarmelarestaurant\nRafael Vidal, Levante's owner and chef, has been offering masterclasses in paella since around 2009 at its first location, which is outside the city. And besides teaching locals and visitors how to make paella, Vidal has had some high-profile students. \"Levante has always championed paella as their signature dish,\" says Camarena. \"In fact, he mentored [Spanish celebrity chef] José Andrés and collaborated with him on his paella projects in Las Vegas, assisting him throughout. Levante is definitely a must-visit.\"\nA second location of Levante opened in 2011 within the city, but moved to a larger location near Valencia's zoo, the Bioparc, in 2019. \"They make an excellent paella Valenciana; for me, a paella needs to be a couple of centimetres thick to have all the layers of texture,\" says Camarena.\nWebsite: https://www.restaurantelevante.comAddress: Av. de Manuel de Falla, 12, Campanar, 46015 València, ValenciaPhone: +34 960 65 11 52Instagram: @restaurantelevante\nHolding a Michelin Bib Gourmand, Napicol is found on Valencia's city outskirts. \"[It's] just 10 minutes from Valencia, right in the middle of La Huerta [the countryside] and it's incredibly beautiful,\" says Camarena. The drive there allows visitors to see where Valencia's produce is grown, getting a peek at the Valencian Community's rural areas.\nOwner and chef Anselmo Rausell sources many of his ingredients from the organic orchard next to the restaurant. While he serves up traditional paella Valenciana, he adds snails to the dish, an ingredient that Camarena considers optional in the original recipe. \"Finding snails in your paella is very traditional, but not that common [nowadays],\" he says. \"A lot of people either don’t like them or feel a bit squeamish about it. However, in a setting like Napicol, I think people are more open to encountering those snails.\"\n\"It's challenging to understand how each ingredient contributes flavour to the paella; it's the combination of everything that creates layers of complexity. For me, the snail adds another layer of depth to the flavours in the paella,\" he adds.\nDuring the summer, Napicol hosts \"Summer Nights\" on Saturdays, where patrons can enjoy live music on an outdoor stage on the patio while having dinner. \"I’d say that enjoying a paella right in the heart of the Valencian countryside at Napicol adds an almost religious significance to the experience,\" says Camarena.\nWebsite: https://www.napicol.comAddress: Carrer de Sant Isidre, 28, 46133 Alqueria de Roca, ValenciaPhone: +34 961 11 91 10Instagram: @restaurantenapicol\nGoya's first iteration was as a classic Spanish neighbourhood bar when it opened in 1950 in the La Gran Via neighbourhood. Serving typical bar food like bocadillos (sandwiches) and tapas, it attracted big screen names like director Bernardo Bertolucci before eventually closing in 2010. It got a facelift and reopened in 2015 as Goya Gallery, becoming known for its signature rice dishes.\n\"Goya Gallery, located in the centre of Valencia, is another great spot for paella,\" says Camarena. \"Fernando [Navarro] excels at making rice dishes, including paella. His natural talent for cooking is evident in his paella, which is balanced, refined and very well-crafted.\" When asked what a balanced paella Valenciana looks like, Camarena says, \"If a paella doesn't have the right amount of oil, it will be bland and risk burning. If it's too oily, it becomes hard to digest. It's crucial that none of the ingredients overpower the others. If any ingredient stands out, it means the paella isn't balanced. Too much paprika can quickly become overwhelming, as can too much saffron.\"\nWebsite: https://goyagalleryrestaurant.comAddress: Carrer de Borriana, 3, L'Eixample, 46005 València, ValenciaPhone: +34 963 04 18 35Instagram: @goyagalleryrestaurant\nOpened in 2019, Vernetta is a relative newcomer to the Valencian arrocerías scene. With a facade resembling a flower shop more than a restaurant, patrons soon learn why Vernetta's tagline is \"Mercado de las Flores\" (Flower Market).\nDespite Vernetta's recent entry into the scene, its chef has a long trajectory of cooking paella. \"Vernetta also makes excellent rice dishes,\" says Camarena. \"This guy [Pablo García Vernetta] really nails the paella.\"\nOne of the standout features of Vernetta's paella is the perfectly achieved socarrat – paella's crispy bottom layer that's beloved by all Valencians. \"Understanding that socarrat is an important part of paella. At Vernetta, they've managed to achieve it nicely – without overusing oil, but with a very even consistency.

{"doc_id": 42, "question": "What is the name of the famous convict colony in Tasmania?", "answer": ["Port Arthur"], "doc": "From Tasmania to Vietnam, the world is filled with astounding rock formations for intrepid climbers. Here, Australian climber and photographer Simon Carter picks five of the best.\nMaybe it was Tom Cruise clambering up the red rock of Utah's Dead Horse Point in Mission: Impossible II that made people want to test their mettle, or the Oscar-winning film Free Solo that documented Alex Honnold's inspirational ascent of the 3,000ft-high rock face of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park without ropes or safety gear. Whatever the reason, climbing has boomed in popularity around the world. \n\"I've seen so many people getting into outdoor climbing over the last 20 years,\" says Australian climber and photographer Simon Carter. \"A lot of that's down to films, and to the proliferation of indoor climbing gyms, as well as sport climbing finally making it into the Olympics in 2020 in Japan.\"\nFrom Madagascar to China, the world is filled with towers, cliffs, caves and other astounding formations for intrepid souls who want to see what they're made of, whether they're sport climbing, bouldering, top-roping or free soloing. Many of the greatest climbing locations are gathered in Carter's new book The Art of Climbing. \"The physical and mental challenge of climbing\" was what first attracted Carter, who's been climbing for 40 years. \"But as I got more into it, it was about the places I was exploring and the people I was hanging out with. What I love about climbing is you get to experience random places on the planet, which are so interesting – it gives you a slice of a place you'd rarely explore as a tourist. The connection to nature is one of the most powerful things. You spend long periods of time in the most spectacular locations. You end up awed and fascinated by these places.\"\nHere are five of Carter's favourite climbing locations around the world to push your limits or just enjoy the sheer beauty of wild, rugged nature.\nFor an edge-of-the-world feel, few places can match the Tasman Peninsula in south-east Tasmania, Australia. The peninsula's known for Port Arthur, a famous convict colony from the 1800s when Australia was first settled by Europeans. But for climbers, it's the rugged coastline's giant sea columns of Jurassic dolerite, protruding up to 300m from the sea, that call to them. \nAbout an hour's drive from Hobart, Tasmania's capital, the Tasman Peninsula is home to a famous \"trilogy\" of iconic pillars. \"The Totem Pole, The Moai and Pole Dancer [pictured above] are adventurous outings for experienced climbers only,\" explains Carter. \"They all require at least two hours of hiking and an abseil to get to the pillars. The Moai (22m) is a moderately adventurous outing. In the case of Pole Dancer, it is a full-on adventure that takes at least five hours of hiking, two abseils and several pitches of climbing just to reach the start of Pole Dancer (40m) itself.\nThe Totem Pole, 65m metres high in total and only about 4m wide at the base, is quite a technically challenging rock climb for harder rock climbers. \"It's like a big matchstick – an incredible thing jutting out of the ocean. This is technical climbing in the most mind-blowing location you can imagine.\"\nTasmania can be reached with direct flights from Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane to Hobart and Launceston, or by the Spirit of Tasmania car ferry, which crosses between Geelong on mainland Australia to Devonport – having your own vehicle makes it easier to reach the island's remote parts.\nCrete, Corfu, Santorini, Mykonos… some of the names of the 6,000 Greek Islands are incredibly well-known to holidaymakers. Kalymnos, between the islands of Kos and Leros in the Dodecanese chain, is far less famous, but among climbers, it's legendary. \"Kalymnos could not be more famous amongst climbers,\" Carter says. \"It's a rocky island and it's not aesthetically the most beautiful Greek island. But for climbers it's a paradise, with cliffs and crags and caves all over it. It's probably the most popular single rock-climbing destination in the world right now. There must be well over 4,000 individual climbs on the limestone crags scattered all over Kalymnos and the neighbouring Telendos Island. The range of difficulty covers every grade, from easiest climbs to incredibly difficult – there really is something for everyone.\"\nTravellers can take a direct flight from Athens to Kalymnos or catch ferries from other islands, such as Rhodes. Among the most remarkable and challenging climbing experiences is Crystal Cave (pictured above) on Telendos, reachable via a 30-minute ferry or water taxi from Kalymnos and then a 1.5km hike (or ask the boat to drop you closer to Crystal Cave, which they're often happy to do). \"Crystal Cave is a long, hard, technical endurance climb – a very physical, gymnastic route,\" Carter adds. \"You need a 100m rope to do it because the cave is so high; when you get to the top of the cave, you need enough rope to lower off and get back to the ground. It's an extraordinary place.\"\nSmith Rocks State Park in Oregon is widely recognised as the birthplace of modern American sport climbing. Carter explains that climbing started becoming popular here in the 1960s and 1970s, then really took off in the '80s, when climbers looking for harder challenges turned their attention to the blank-looking walls. \n\"The steep clean walls had no cracks or features, so climbers started equipping the routes with permanently fixed safety bolts, which enabled climbers to concentrate on pushing the physical, gymnastic side of climbing, which became known as 'sport climbing' and took off around the country,\" he says.\nReached via a 200-mile drive from Portland, Smith Rock State Park is located in central Oregon's high desert. \"Smith Rocks is an awe-inspiring place,\" says Carter. \"The state park has the Crooked River running through it. It's a little oasis in the middle of the countryside. You have ranches and farmland, and then, boom, this state park pops up out of nowhere with these cool orange welded tuff rock formations for climbing, including The Smith Rock Group (in the background of the photo above), The Christian Brothers, The Dihedrals, Aggro Gully and the Monkey Face. The area has a Wild West feel to me. It's a place where you really feel you should be getting around on a horse. It has a slightly desolate feel, with these confronting walls of blankness.\" \nMore that 2,000 routes line the park's rocky landscapes. Most visitors go for one of the many easy or moderate routes, but hardcore climbers might attempt time-tested classics, such as To Bolt Or Not To Be, which is \"a stunning, blank-looking 41m-high wall in the Dihedrals area\", according to Carter. \"It requires consistent, hard climbing. When it was first climbed by French climber Jean Baptiste Tribout in 1986, it was the hardest route in North America. The cheeky name he gave the route made a point – soon after, sport climbing took off in the US. Years later, the route remains a coveted test-piece for top climbers today.\"\nThere's a whole lot of limestone with abundant climbing opportunities along France's south coast, but Calanques National Park, outside Marseilles, is the epicentre that draws in adventurers from around the world. \"The Calanques is a very historically significant area for rock climbers. French mountaineers in the early 1900s would go there when the weather was bad in the mountains to hone their technical skills, so there are amazing traditional rock climbs, like Arête de Marseille, a classic, easy route for experienced climbers on La Grande Candelle formation overlooking the Mediterranean, which was first climbed in 1927, as well as more modern climbing.\"\nMore like this:• Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms• The UK's five most beautiful national parks• The hidden wonders of Mexico's sacred underwater world\nThere are 26 calanques (or, roughly, \"rocky inlets\") in the national park, a 520-sq-km area that's popular with hikers, boaters, yachters, swimmers and nature lovers, as well as climbers. Marseille makes a good base, a 30-minute bus or car journey from the national park, or climbers can stay in one of the little port towns, such as Les Goudes. \"Climbers can choose from some of the long, old traditional climbs, or hard modern sport climbs on overhangs and caves,\" says Carter. \"The climbing is easy-to-moderate, with some harder stuff. There's something for everyone. The limestone here is so beautiful. Some of the climbs start from little beaches. What's also special about the Calanques is that you're climbing above the lovely sparkling Mediterranean ocean.\"\nThere's a sedate pace to the junk boat cruises that carry travellers around Hạ Long Bay, a gorgeous area in north-east Vietnam with more than 2,000 limestone karsts soaring out of the ocean, some as high as 400m. But the Unesco World Heritage Site is also an adventure playground, with fantastic opportunities for sea kayaking, scuba diving, hiking and rock climbing. \"Hạ Long Bay is a crazily beautiful place,\" says Carter. \"When you cruise around the area, you're transfixed by what you're seeing. It's one of those places where you feel you've really travelled somewhere unique and adventurous.\"\nCát Bà, the largest island in the bay, is the main hub for climbers, with the rugged mountains of Cát Bà National Park and the popular cliff Butterfly Wall. But to really experience the best of the Bay, you need to explore by boat. \"Although many of the karsts are too sharp, low-angled and vegetated to be of interest to most modern rock climbers, there are specks of gold for adventurous explorers,\" says Carter. \"You could get lost in this area, exploring for days by boat.\"\nThe Bay's climbs are not ideal for novices. \"You can't get a lot done as a beginner there – it's for adventurous, experienced climbers,\" Carter says. He picks out The Face and Turtle Cave as two favourite climbs within easy reach of Cát Bà. \"The Face is a huge wall of limestone, which looks like candlewax has dripped down the rock face. To climb it is an unusual experience. There are also plenty of climbs in the area where, once you've finished, you can abseil back down to a beach. But the greatest benefit of the area comes with the 'deep-water soloing' challenges, where you can just step off the boat and climb without a rope – just you, the rock and the ocean as your 'crash pad'.\" Turtle Cave is a perfect example of that, where climbers aim to climb to the lip of a cave 10m above the ocean – without using a rope.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

In the case of Pole Dancer, it is a full-on adventure that takes at least five hours of hiking, two abseils and several pitches of climbing just to reach the start of Pole Dancer (40m) itself.\nThe Totem Pole, 65m metres high in total and only about 4m wide at the base, is quite a technically challenging rock climb for harder rock climbers. \"It's like a big matchstick – an incredible thing jutting out of the ocean. This is technical climbing in the most mind-blowing location you can imagine.\"\nTasmania can be reached with direct flights from Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane to Hobart and Launceston, or by the Spirit of Tasmania car ferry, which crosses between Geelong on mainland Australia to Devonport – having your own vehicle makes it easier to reach the island's remote parts.\nCrete, Corfu, Santorini, Mykonos… some of the names of the 6,000 Greek Islands are incredibly well-known to holidaymakers. Kalymnos, between the islands of Kos and Leros in the Dodecanese chain, is far less famous, but among climbers, it's legendary. \"Kalymnos could not be more famous amongst climbers,\" Carter says. \"It's a rocky island and it's not aesthetically the most beautiful Greek island. But for climbers it's a paradise, with cliffs and crags and caves all over it. It's probably the most popular single rock-climbing destination in the world right now. There must be well over 4,000 individual climbs on the limestone crags scattered all over Kalymnos and the neighbouring Telendos Island. The range of difficulty covers every grade, from easiest climbs to incredibly difficult – there really is something for everyone.\"\nTravellers can take a direct flight from Athens to Kalymnos or catch ferries from other islands, such as Rhodes. Among the most remarkable and challenging climbing experiences is Crystal Cave (pictured above) on Telendos, reachable via a 30-minute ferry or water taxi from Kalymnos and then a 1.5km hike (or ask the boat to drop you closer to Crystal Cave, which they're often happy to do). \"Crystal Cave is a long, hard, technical endurance climb – a very physical, gymnastic route,\" Carter adds. \"You need a 100m rope to do it because the cave is so high; when you get to the top of the cave, you need enough rope to lower off and get back to the ground. It's an extraordinary place.\"\nSmith Rocks State Park in Oregon is widely recognised as the birthplace of modern American sport climbing. Carter explains that climbing started becoming popular here in the 1960s and 1970s, then really took off in the '80s, when climbers looking for harder challenges turned their attention to the blank-looking walls. \n\"The steep clean walls had no cracks or features, so climbers started equipping the routes with permanently fixed safety bolts, which enabled climbers to concentrate on pushing the physical, gymnastic side of climbing, which became known as 'sport climbing' and took off around the country,\" he says.\nReached via a 200-mile drive from Portland, Smith Rock State Park is located in central Oregon's high desert. \"Smith Rocks is an awe-inspiring place,\" says Carter. \"The state park has the Crooked River running through it. It's a little oasis in the middle of the countryside. You have ranches and farmland, and then, boom, this state park pops up out of nowhere with these cool orange welded tuff rock formations for climbing, including The Smith Rock Group (in the background of the photo above), The Christian Brothers, The Dihedrals, Aggro Gully and the Monkey Face. The area has a Wild West feel to me. It's a place where you really feel you should be getting around on a horse. It has a slightly desolate feel, with these confronting walls of blankness.\" \nMore that 2,000 routes line the park's rocky landscapes. Most visitors go for one of the many easy or moderate routes, but hardcore climbers might attempt time-tested classics, such as To Bolt Or Not To Be, which is \"a stunning, blank-looking 41m-high wall in the Dihedrals area\", according to Carter. \"It requires consistent, hard climbing. When it was first climbed by French climber Jean Baptiste Tribout in 1986, it was the hardest route in North America. The cheeky name he gave the route made a point – soon after, sport climbing took off in the US. Years later, the route remains a coveted test-piece for top climbers today.\"\nThere's a whole lot of limestone with abundant climbing opportunities along France's south coast, but Calanques National Park, outside Marseilles, is the epicentre that draws in adventurers from around the world. \"The Calanques is a very historically significant area for rock climbers. French mountaineers in the early 1900s would go there when the weather was bad in the mountains to hone their technical skills, so there are amazing traditional rock climbs, like Arête de Marseille, a classic, easy route for experienced climbers on La Grande Candelle formation overlooking the Mediterranean, which was first climbed in 1927, as well as more modern climbing.\"\nMore like this:• Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms• The UK's five most beautiful national parks• The hidden wonders of Mexico's sacred underwater world\nThere are 26 calanques (or, roughly, \"rocky inlets\") in the national park, a 520-sq-km area that's popular with hikers, boaters, yachters, swimmers and nature lovers, as well as climbers. Marseille makes a good base, a 30-minute bus or car journey from the national park, or climbers can stay in one of the little port towns, such as Les Goudes. \"Climbers can choose from some of the long, old traditional climbs, or hard modern sport climbs on overhangs and caves,\" says Carter. \"The climbing is easy-to-moderate, with some harder stuff. There's something for everyone. The limestone here is so beautiful. Some of the climbs start from little beaches. What's also special about the Calanques is that you're climbing above the lovely sparkling Mediterranean ocean.\"\nThere's a sedate pace to the junk boat cruises that carry travellers around Hạ Long Bay, a gorgeous area in north-east Vietnam with more than 2,000 limestone karsts soaring out of the ocean, some as high as 400m. But the Unesco World Heritage Site is also an adventure playground, with fantastic opportunities for sea kayaking, scuba diving, hiking and rock climbing. \"Hạ Long Bay is a crazily beautiful place,\" says Carter. \"When you cruise around the area, you're transfixed by what you're seeing. It's one of those places where you feel you've really travelled somewhere unique and adventurous.\"\nCát Bà, the largest island in the bay, is the main hub for climbers, with the rugged mountains of Cát Bà National Park and the popular cliff Butterfly Wall. But to really experience the best of the Bay, you need to explore by boat. \"Although many of the karsts are too sharp, low-angled and vegetated to be of interest to most modern rock climbers, there are specks of gold for adventurous explorers,\" says Carter. \"You could get lost in this area, exploring for days by boat.\"\nThe Bay's climbs are not ideal for novices. \"You can't get a lot done as a beginner there – it's for adventurous, experienced climbers,\" Carter says. He picks out The Face and Turtle Cave as two favourite climbs within easy reach of Cát Bà. \"The Face is a huge wall of limestone, which looks like candlewax has dripped down the rock face. To climb it is an unusual experience. There are also plenty of climbs in the area where, once you've finished, you can abseil back down to a beach. But the greatest benefit of the area comes with the 'deep-water soloing' challenges, where you can just step off the boat and climb without a rope – just you, the rock and the ocean as your 'crash pad'.\" Turtle Cave is a perfect example of that, where climbers aim to climb to the lip of a cave 10m above the ocean – without using a rope.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}
{"doc_id": 43, "question": "What is the name of the new 8,500-person arena being built in Athens, Georgia?", "answer": ["Akins Ford Arena"], "doc": "Renowned for its party scene and the birthplace of some hugely influential bands, this small city is quietly showing its bigger counterparts how a place can grow up while keeping its edge.\nSome Americans may know the lore of Athens, Georgia, and its claims to fame. Located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains 70 miles north-east of Atlanta, the small city is home to the University of Georgia (UGA), the US's first state-chartered college established in 1785. UGA's football team, the Georgia Bulldogs, is a perennial, national championship-calibre powerhouse. What's more, Athens's homegrown heroes, the B-52s and REM, were as influential as any rock 'n' roll bands to meld post-punk, new wave and indie sounds during the last quarter of the 20th Century. That notoriety spawned a musical legacy that continues to attract aspiring artists today.\nBut many visitors are now discovering a new side of Athens, and this music-obsessed college town is quietly showing bigger US cities how a place can grow up while keeping its edge.\nI'm discovering it too: a year ago, I moved back to The Classic City where I went to college in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Back then the place brimmed with cramped and sweaty music halls, raucous house parties, gritty dive bars and cheap, late-night eats. Much of that edge remains, but the polished city I've returned to now also shimmers with a nuanced culinary scene, boutique hotels, cocktail lounges and the soon-to-open 8,500-person Akins Ford Arena, which will be christened with a concert by the B-52s this December. The arena will also host the local hockey team, the Rock Lobsters (named after the B-52s' first single) and is expected to draw some of the nation's biggest bands.\nWhat I quickly learned is that, like me, Athens has matured. A point underscored by a string of recent, very adult-sounding anniversaries. Last year was the 40th for REM's first album, Murmur. The B-52s' first album turned 45. The famed Georgia Theatre, where BB King, The Police and Wynton Marsalis have played, also turned 45 as a concert venue. And the countdown is on for the 50th anniversary of Wuxtry Records, ground zero for musicians since 1976 and where devotees find racks of vinyl dedicated to local legends like Pylon, Drive-by Truckers, Widespread Panic and of Montreal.\nAs such, Athens has also started catering to a more mature crowd. Travellers are increasingly attracted to its blend of homey-meets-urban, where people walk to the post office and wave to their neighbours, but still demand great restaurants and the chance to squeeze into those sweaty music halls nightly. Recent tourism numbers bear out this attraction. Travel here is surging, with visitor-spending up more than 30% since the city's pre-pandemic crest in 2019.\n\"I'm not sure why there's been an uptick in folks 'discovering' Athens recently, but I have a few educated guesses,\" says Janet Geddis, the owner of the zealously indie Avid Bookshop. \"Athens feels like a small town, yet is marked by creativity and social activism that are more often associated with large cities. It's a rare combination that provides folks with comfort that comes from being known as well as the expansiveness that comes with exposure to a creative vibe.\"\nAnd though some locals worry this new rendition of Athens comes at the cost of being \"discovered\" and the need to \"keep Athens weird\" (to paraphrase the counter-commodification battle cry of Austin, Texas, over the last 25 years), for other long-time residents, such evolution is both welcomed and no surprise.\n\"The fact that we were off the beaten path really allowed for unbridled creativity,\" Mike Mills, a founding member of REM, told me when asked about Athens's importance to the band's early days. Mills has been here since 1979, when he enrolled at UGA. \"But the cat's pretty much out of the bag as far as the things Athens has to offer … a lot of great things happen here. There are a lot more dining choices than there used to be [and] there is still a lot of music going on. The Georgia Theatre is a beautiful venue. The 40 Watt [which has hosted the likes of Patti Smith, Nirvana and Sonic Youth] is still its wonderful, iconic self.\"\nA big reason for Athens's emergence from UGA's shadow in recent years is because this 130,000-person Southern college town (which includes 40,000 students) has blossomed into a true gourmet destination.\nFive & Ten was among the first to change the culinary landscape here when it opened almost 25 years ago, in the Five Points neighbourhood. \"Modern Southern\" dishes like Frogmore stew (shrimp, andouille sausage and grilled pork tenderloin served with a grit cake and Georgia peach butter) have become Athens standards. \"Over the years, people left, came back and opened places that added new flavours,\" says Peter Dale, the restaurant's owner and chef and an Athens native. \"Somewhere along the way, Athens grew up.\"\nFive & Ten has since inspired a growing and eclectic smattering of new and nationally touted restaurants. Puma Yu's, which opened in 2022, serves Asian-inspired plates in a one-time denim factory in the repurposed Mill District. Seabear Oyster Bar, in the old Coca-Cola bottling plant on Prince Avenue, is where to go for just-shucked oysters, shrimp, crab and Tiki-inspired cocktails like the Snowbird: dark rum, amaretto, coconut, lime, pineapple and turbinado sugar. A few blocks away, Birdies sandwich shop and market (which opened in 2023) offers delectable high-end cheeses, olive oils and jams. And just this month, Top Chef contestant Kenny Nguyen opened Pretty Boy, where he serves the Vietnamese flavours of his childhood.\n\"Athens has a history of attracting really talented people,\" says Erin Wilson, an owner at The National restaurant, a downtown cornerstone featuring seasonal dishes like cucumber gazpacho, pan-roasted swordfish and Portuguese-style custard tarts. \"And people here support local businesses.\"\nThough Athens has topped college-party-town lists for decades with around 80 spots to imbibe stuffed into the compact downtown area, the question was always: where does one carouse after college? Not to be outdone by the city's culinary success, the lounge-and-bar circuit has now found its adult stride.\nThere are still downtown favourites like Manhattan Cafe and The World Famous serving honest mixed drinks in the historically Black business district known as Hot Corner – which is anchored by the Morton Theatre, where Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington once played. Around the corner, Creature Comforts Brewery, opened in a former tyre store, attracts a growing number of craft connoisseurs.\nIn the last few years, the scene has also gone uptown, literally and figuratively. The Hidden Gem, which opened in December 2023 near the Boulevard neighbourhood, became an immediate favourite among townies. It did so with a vibe that screams today's Athens: excellent cocktails meet mismatched, estate-sale décor. And wine lovers inevitably find the Lark, a retail shop and bar established during the pandemic, where Athenians can now learn about, try and buy hundreds of curated, international labels.\n\"The National and Five & Ten were proof to us that we could open this place,\" says the Lark's owner Krista Slater. \"There's a concentration of culture here … and the community – not just the university – is ardently supportive of perpetuating that.\"\nIt's midsummer in Athens and school's out. The Deep South is slow and sticky. A train chugging along the tracks north of downtown blows its horn; the sound suspended in the heavy night air. This is a peaceful time when year-round Athenians take back their town before students return for football games and changing leaves.\nOn this Friday night, however, The National has set up a DJ stand and opened its doors for a makeshift party. A packed house spills between the dining room-turned-dance floor and the sidewalk patio along Hancock Avenue. These aren't just the townie bartenders, artists, waiters and musicians from the Athens summers of my youth. Among the sweaty dancers is a new breed of year-rounders: middle-aged lawyers, moms and dads, local business owners, doctors and professors.\n\"For people like me, the town and school have reached a nice equilibrium,\" says Jessica Parrillo, another returnee, who opened a psychology practice here after spending years in Philadelphia and Washington DC. We're standing in front of Ciné, a community-based movie theatre next to The National. \"The town's patron is and has been UGA. But more people are coming to eat, see music, visit museums, cycle the city's Greenway and Firefly Trails and simply hang out.\"\nMore like this: • How water shaped New York City • An iconic dish of the American South • The sinking islands of the Southern US\nAt the Athens Farmers' Market in Bishop Park the next morning, I recognise a few groggy faces from The National's dance party. Instead of cutting the rug, they're now pulling children in red wagons and toting produce, flowers and bread from local vendors.

{"doc_id": 44, "question": "What is Mario Lopez's favorite type of Mexican food?", "answer": ["Seafood (mariscos)"], "doc": "The actor and born-and-bred Chicano loves hole-in-the wall Mexican food. Here are his top eats in LA from birria tacos at Birrieria Gonzalez to cócteles de camarón at Mariscos el Bigoton.\nIn recent years, Mario Lopez – forever beloved for playing the self-sure AC Slater on the early 1990s teen sitcom, Saved by the Bell – has become almost as known for his love for Mexican food as he is for his epic dancing talent and easygoing, affable TV and podcast persona.\n \n\"I'm really a fat kid at heart, and I love food,\" jokes the famously dimpled and fit Lopez, who identifies as a \"first-generation, Mexican kid\" with a foot in both worlds. \"I grew up on Mexican food. I'm fortunate that in Southern California it's the best. It's authentic, it's delicious. Outside of LA, Mexican food is a step down. I'm sorry,\" he shrugs. \"But it is.\"\nLopez moved to Los Angeles as a young actor and calls it home. \"I love Los Angeles,\" he says. \"All my kids were born here. And my dad, when he immigrated to this country [from Culiacán, Mexico], first came to LA.\"\nIn 1781, the first Mexican settlers established the pueblo of Los Angeles, then part of Mexico; 40 years before Mexico would declare independence from Spain. Today, Mexican Americans comprise 31.9% of the city's population, and there are many historically Mexican enclaves, including East Los Angeles, Pacoima, the Boyle Heights neighbourhood – home to Mariachi Plaza – and colourful Olvera Street, a tree-shaded block lined with Mexican restaurants, museums and kitschy souvenir shops.\n\"[Mexican culture is] everywhere you go,\" says Lopez. \"Mexicans are all around us, really. That's what's beautiful. You don't have to look far…. Even if you're not Mexican you're a little bit Mexican because the culture is so strong, and it permeates with food and the music and just the people. It's the fabric of the society here.\"\nLopez's pride in his Mexican heritage is never more on display than when he talks about his culture's food or devours it in his charming Instagram food vids. \"I love mariscos (seafood) specifically. That's my favourite,\" he says. \"But I don't discriminate when it comes to Mexican food.\"\nHere are Lopez's favourite places to get Mexican food in Los Angeles.\n\"I don't really go to a lot of high-end Mexican restaurants,\" says Lopez. \"I can't even tell you the last one, because when I want to eat Mexican, I just usually go to hole-in-the-wall places. I like to support these businesses; mom and pop, family owned. I'd like to raise their profile, if I can.\"\nLike Birrieria Gonzalez: a fleet of Mexican lunch trucks with locations throughout the Greater Los Angeles area (Lopez hits the Pacoima branch). The eye-catching red carts serve a delicious array of tacos and quesadillas, but Lopez especially loves their Tijuana-style beef birria tacos. \"Those are delicious, and the consommé is just so fresh and tasty,\" he says. \nBirria, a type of marinated beef barbacoa served au jus, native to western Mexico, is a highly popular filling for tacos; served on griddled corn tortillas and dunked in consommé before each crispy, juicy bite. Never tried one? \"You're missing out,\" says Lopez. \"You got to try it. It's amazing. You can't beat it. You can have it with cheese. You can have it without cheese. You can have it dorado (golden-fried). You can have it soft. I like it soft, but you got to dip it in the consommé. That's good stuff, and it makes it very, very flavourful.\"\nWebsite: https://birrieriagonzalezofficial.com/Address: 10736 Laurel Canyon Blvd, Pacoima, CA 91331Phone: (213) 588-3914Instagram: @birrieria_gonzalez\nThe market (mercado) – plays a pivotal role in Mexican culture; a place to meet, a place to eat. In Los Angeles, Mexican mercados range from the traditional labyrinthine El Mercadito in East Los Angeles to chic Mexican food courts like La Paloma in South LA's Figueroa Corridor to everyday Mexican shopping experiences, like Lopez's pick: Vallarta Supermarkets. \"They got a bunch of them all over here in LA,\" he says. \"I really like those guys.\"\nThe Vallarta Supermarket chain began as a family-run carnicería (butcher shop) in Van Nuys in 1985, later expanding to full-blown supermarkets and becoming a South California institution. Browse Mexican butchery, dry ingredients, snacks and produce as well as the prepared foods in the market's La Cocina section. The Tortilleria produces handmade tortillas, hot from the grill, as well as sweet and savoury tamales.\nWebsite: https://vallartasupermarkets.com/en/Instagram: @vallarta.supermarkets\nFresh seafood is an essential element of Mexican cuisine; flavoured with bright squeezes of lime and zesty cilantro.

{"doc_id": 45, "question": "What significant event in 1998 helped transform tourism in Northern Ireland?", "answer": ["The Good Friday Agreement"], "doc": "Thirty years ago, tourism to Northern Ireland was almost non-existent. Now, the country's newfound sense of optimism is once again luring travellers to its shores.\nIt's a sunny Saturday evening in Derry, Northern Ireland, and Ebrington Square on the northern banks of the River Foyle is buzzing. Tourists enjoy a drink on the terrace of the newly opened Ebrington Hotel & Spa. A busker draws a crowd outside the Embankment Bar & Grill and drinkers at the Walled City Brewery overflow onto the pavement.  \nIt's a familiar enough scene, but what makes this unusual is the location. During the Troubles – the decades-long clash between Protestant loyalists to the UK and Catholic nationalists who wanted to be reunited with the Republic of Ireland – that affected Northern Ireland from the late 1960s until the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, Derry was on the frontline of conflict.\nLocated right on the border with the Republic of Ireland, the city suffered attacks and bombings carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and clashes with the British army, brought in to keep the peace. Ebrington Square itself was home to the British army barracks, an impenetrable fortress looming over a divided city. \nThe conflict cast a long shadow over the nation, and 30 years ago, tourism in Northern Ireland was almost non-existent. As the Troubles began to ease after the IRA declared a ceasefire in August 1994, a few intrepid travellers arrived to visit the \"sites\" they'd seen on the news. Belfast's now legendary Black Cab Tours give an indication of what these were: bomb sites, \"peace walls\" constructed to keep opposing sides apart and overtly political murals.\nNow, however, peace has truly taken centre stage, and Ebrington Square is a visible symbol of the results. Reached by the S-shaped Peace Bridge that snakes its way across the river from the foot of the old walled city (the path to peace is never straight), the former no-go area is now the place to go.\nAccording to Aeidin McCarter, Derry Council's Investment and Enterprise Development officer, tourist numbers to Derry have doubled in the past 10 years, with visitors drawn by the city's stunning location, fascinating history and burgeoning hospitality industry.\n\"Derry's been transformed over the past 25 years, and last year was our biggest ever year for visitors,\" says McCarter. \"People are still interested in the history of The Troubles, but they come here because it's a tourist destination like any other European city. Peace has brought about that transformation. There's a thriving food and drink scene, bombed buildings have been restored and opened to the public and you can now walk the length of the once heavily guarded city walls.\"\nFrom the top of those 17th-Century walls, there are fine views in all directions: along the river to the sea, across the city to the surrounding mountains of Donegal and down to the area known as \"the Bogside\". Built on land formed after the river silted up, this predominantly Catholic estate was at the epicentre of the Troubles. It was here on Bloody Sunday (30 January 1972) that British troops opened fire on civil rights protesters, killing 13 and injuring 14 others, one of whom later died.\nBetween 1969 and 1972, part of the Bogside was a self-declared autonomous Irish Nationalist area known as \"Free Derry\". The Museum of Free Derry, which opened in 2007 in Bogside, tells the uneasy history of this period. And in July 2024, the much-anticipated Peacemakers Museum opened nearby, telling the next chapter in the Derry story: how the conflict escalated to virtual civil war before the gradual onset of peace.\n\"It's divided into sections, which relate to key periods that form the backdrop to the Good Friday Agreement,\" said project manager Michael Cooper. \"As you walk around the museum, you move from Bloody Sunday to the present day and learn about the roles of local residents and politicians Martin McGuinness, Mitchel McLaughlin and John Hume in the peace process.\"\nJohn Hume, an Irish nationalist politician who worked tirelessly for a peaceful way forward, was awarded Nobel, Gandhi and Martin Luther King peace prizes for his efforts, the only person to receive all three awards, and visitors can see them displayed at the Guildhall Museum in the city centre.   \nMore like this:• The incredible reinvention of Ireland's 'awful' tourist town• The Irish city you should visit in 2024• Ireland's whipped cream and local berry treat \nBefore the Good Friday Agreement, Derry/Londonderry, depending on which side of the political divide you sit (nationalists favour using the name Derry, and unionists Londonderry), was peppered with military checkpoints. Now, you can come and go freely but their legacy remains. Northern Ireland's dramatic, littoral itinerary, the Causeway Coastal Route, begins just north of Belfast and stops in Derry; there's then a gap of 30 miles before the Republic's Wild Atlantic Way begins at Malin Head in County Donegal on the island's northernmost tip.\nIn 2020, the Irish Government launched a \"Shared Island Initiative\" to enhance cooperation between the two countries. One if its current projects is to link these two major coastal routes to create a continuous island driving route along the west coast, taking you through wild and rugged countryside dotted with enchanting villages and historic monuments. \nAnother initiative is the Narrow Water Bridge, a project that was officially launched in June 2024. Crossing sparkling Carlingford Lough at Warrenpoint, the site of one of the worst IRA bomb attacks in 1979, the bridge will join the two nations at the spot where President Joe Biden's ancestors set sail across the Atlantic. Scheduled to open in 2027, the bridge will allow visitors easy access between the Republic and Northern Ireland on the east coast and bring them, in just an hour's drive from Dublin or Belfast, to an area of spectacular natural beauty, taking in the Mourne and Cooley Mountains, the Ring of Gullion, thriving coastal resorts like Newcastle, and the Castlewellan Peace Maze. The latter's 6,000 yew trees, planted in 1998 to mark the Good Friday agreement, are now fully grown.\n\"These projects are physical manifestations of the optimism that has grown since Good Friday,\" said Tourism Ireland's Helen McGorman. \"[It's] a shift in emphasis away from the Troubles to the amazing scenery, the incredible cities and the island's much wider history.\"  \nThe biggest of those projects was the launch of Titanic Belfast, a museum dedicated to the world's most famous cruise liner, housed in a behemoth of a building on the exact same spot in Belfast's docks where the Titanic was built. Since its 2012 opening, it has attracted eight million visitors and brings £70-80m into the economy each year.\n\"Titanic Belfast was a project that came off the back of the Good Friday agreement,\" said Judith Owens, the museum's CEO. \"Titanic was well-known and our job was to take that brand, bring it back to Northern Ireland and use that to catapult us into the global tourist industry.\" \nShe added: \"We get visitors from 142 different countries and once they are here they explore further afield, discovering our heritage and culture and a country with a very different identity to the one it had 30 years ago.\"\nThirty years ago, visitors to Northern Ireland were mainly journalists and anyone taking photographs did so with the aim of making the front page. But Martin McCrossan, a forward-thinking Derry local in a mixed Catholic/Protestant marriage with a keen interest in local history was one of the first to make a bid for tourists. \n\"In 1994, my father decided he was going to set up a tour guiding business,\" his daughter, Charlene, told me. Since her father passed away, she runs the company he founded, along with her mother and is one of its main guides, regularly taking visitors to the city walls, Derry's two cathedrals and sites made famous by the hugely popular TV series, Derry Girls.\n\"At the time, everyone thought he was completely mad, but he wanted to show people there was more to the city than the Troubles. I remember him telling me that one day there would be peace and, in its wake, tourists.\"\nFor evidence of that, you need look no further than the queue forming outside the newly opened Stich and Weave restaurant in Ebrington Square. Housed in the former army canteen, its name is a nod to the city's shirt-making history (at the turn of the last century, 80% of shirts worn in the British Empire were made in Derry). Behind the restaurant, on the edge of the square beside the water, work is underway on the new DNA (Derry North Atlantic) maritime museum, which will chart the city's history, illustrating how its position as the UK's westernmost port is woven into its DNA.

{"doc_id": 45, "question": "What major project was launched in 2020 to enhance cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?", "answer": ["The Shared Island Initiative"], "doc": "Thirty years ago, tourism to Northern Ireland was almost non-existent. Now, the country's newfound sense of optimism is once again luring travellers to its shores.\nIt's a sunny Saturday evening in Derry, Northern Ireland, and Ebrington Square on the northern banks of the River Foyle is buzzing. Tourists enjoy a drink on the terrace of the newly opened Ebrington Hotel & Spa. A busker draws a crowd outside the Embankment Bar & Grill and drinkers at the Walled City Brewery overflow onto the pavement.  \nIt's a familiar enough scene, but what makes this unusual is the location. During the Troubles – the decades-long clash between Protestant loyalists to the UK and Catholic nationalists who wanted to be reunited with the Republic of Ireland – that affected Northern Ireland from the late 1960s until the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, Derry was on the frontline of conflict.\nLocated right on the border with the Republic of Ireland, the city suffered attacks and bombings carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and clashes with the British army, brought in to keep the peace. Ebrington Square itself was home to the British army barracks, an impenetrable fortress looming over a divided city. \nThe conflict cast a long shadow over the nation, and 30 years ago, tourism in Northern Ireland was almost non-existent. As the Troubles began to ease after the IRA declared a ceasefire in August 1994, a few intrepid travellers arrived to visit the \"sites\" they'd seen on the news. Belfast's now legendary Black Cab Tours give an indication of what these were: bomb sites, \"peace walls\" constructed to keep opposing sides apart and overtly political murals.\nNow, however, peace has truly taken centre stage, and Ebrington Square is a visible symbol of the results. Reached by the S-shaped Peace Bridge that snakes its way across the river from the foot of the old walled city (the path to peace is never straight), the former no-go area is now the place to go.\nAccording to Aeidin McCarter, Derry Council's Investment and Enterprise Development officer, tourist numbers to Derry have doubled in the past 10 years, with visitors drawn by the city's stunning location, fascinating history and burgeoning hospitality industry.\n\"Derry's been transformed over the past 25 years, and last year was our biggest ever year for visitors,\" says McCarter. \"People are still interested in the history of The Troubles, but they come here because it's a tourist destination like any other European city. Peace has brought about that transformation. There's a thriving food and drink scene, bombed buildings have been restored and opened to the public and you can now walk the length of the once heavily guarded city walls.\"\nFrom the top of those 17th-Century walls, there are fine views in all directions: along the river to the sea, across the city to the surrounding mountains of Donegal and down to the area known as \"the Bogside\". Built on land formed after the river silted up, this predominantly Catholic estate was at the epicentre of the Troubles. It was here on Bloody Sunday (30 January 1972) that British troops opened fire on civil rights protesters, killing 13 and injuring 14 others, one of whom later died.\nBetween 1969 and 1972, part of the Bogside was a self-declared autonomous Irish Nationalist area known as \"Free Derry\". The Museum of Free Derry, which opened in 2007 in Bogside, tells the uneasy history of this period. And in July 2024, the much-anticipated Peacemakers Museum opened nearby, telling the next chapter in the Derry story: how the conflict escalated to virtual civil war before the gradual onset of peace.\n\"It's divided into sections, which relate to key periods that form the backdrop to the Good Friday Agreement,\" said project manager Michael Cooper. \"As you walk around the museum, you move from Bloody Sunday to the present day and learn about the roles of local residents and politicians Martin McGuinness, Mitchel McLaughlin and John Hume in the peace process.\"\nJohn Hume, an Irish nationalist politician who worked tirelessly for a peaceful way forward, was awarded Nobel, Gandhi and Martin Luther King peace prizes for his efforts, the only person to receive all three awards, and visitors can see them displayed at the Guildhall Museum in the city centre.   \nMore like this:• The incredible reinvention of Ireland's 'awful' tourist town• The Irish city you should visit in 2024• Ireland's whipped cream and local berry treat \nBefore the Good Friday Agreement, Derry/Londonderry, depending on which side of the political divide you sit (nationalists favour using the name Derry, and unionists Londonderry), was peppered with military checkpoints. Now, you can come and go freely but their legacy remains. Northern Ireland's dramatic, littoral itinerary, the Causeway Coastal Route, begins just north of Belfast and stops in Derry; there's then a gap of 30 miles before the Republic's Wild Atlantic Way begins at Malin Head in County Donegal on the island's northernmost tip.\nIn 2020, the Irish Government launched a \"Shared Island Initiative\" to enhance cooperation between the two countries. One if its current projects is to link these two major coastal routes to create a continuous island driving route along the west coast, taking you through wild and rugged countryside dotted with enchanting villages and historic monuments. \nAnother initiative is the Narrow Water Bridge, a project that was officially launched in June 2024. Crossing sparkling Carlingford Lough at Warrenpoint, the site of one of the worst IRA bomb attacks in 1979, the bridge will join the two nations at the spot where President Joe Biden's ancestors set sail across the Atlantic. Scheduled to open in 2027, the bridge will allow visitors easy access between the Republic and Northern Ireland on the east coast and bring them, in just an hour's drive from Dublin or Belfast, to an area of spectacular natural beauty, taking in the Mourne and Cooley Mountains, the Ring of Gullion, thriving coastal resorts like Newcastle, and the Castlewellan Peace Maze. The latter's 6,000 yew trees, planted in 1998 to mark the Good Friday agreement, are now fully grown.\n\"These projects are physical manifestations of the optimism that has grown since Good Friday,\" said Tourism Ireland's Helen McGorman. \"[It's] a shift in emphasis away from the Troubles to the amazing scenery, the incredible cities and the island's much wider history.\"  \nThe biggest of those projects was the launch of Titanic Belfast, a museum dedicated to the world's most famous cruise liner, housed in a behemoth of a building on the exact same spot in Belfast's docks where the Titanic was built. Since its 2012 opening, it has attracted eight million visitors and brings £70-80m into the economy each year.\n\"Titanic Belfast was a project that came off the back of the Good Friday agreement,\" said Judith Owens, the museum's CEO. \"Titanic was well-known and our job was to take that brand, bring it back to Northern Ireland and use that to catapult us into the global tourist industry.\" \nShe added: \"We get visitors from 142 different countries and once they are here they explore further afield, discovering our heritage and culture and a country with a very different identity to the one it had 30 years ago.\"\nThirty years ago, visitors to Northern Ireland were mainly journalists and anyone taking photographs did so with the aim of making the front page. But Martin McCrossan, a forward-thinking Derry local in a mixed Catholic/Protestant marriage with a keen interest in local history was one of the first to make a bid for tourists. \n\"In 1994, my father decided he was going to set up a tour guiding business,\" his daughter, Charlene, told me. Since her father passed away, she runs the company he founded, along with her mother and is one of its main guides, regularly taking visitors to the city walls, Derry's two cathedrals and sites made famous by the hugely popular TV series, Derry Girls.\n\"At the time, everyone thought he was completely mad, but he wanted to show people there was more to the city than the Troubles. I remember him telling me that one day there would be peace and, in its wake, tourists.\"\nFor evidence of that, you need look no further than the queue forming outside the newly opened Stich and Weave restaurant in Ebrington Square. Housed in the former army canteen, its name is a nod to the city's shirt-making history (at the turn of the last century, 80% of shirts worn in the British Empire were made in Derry). Behind the restaurant, on the edge of the square beside the water, work is underway on the new DNA (Derry North Atlantic) maritime museum, which will chart the city's history, illustrating how its position as the UK's westernmost port is woven into its DNA. Due to open in 2026, it will be the latest in a series of new visitor attractions that have sprung up since the Good Friday Agreement, and another symbol of the country's optimism. \nOne of Northern Ireland's greatest storytellers was Belfast-born CS Lewis, who drew inspiration for Narnia from the snow-covered Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland's south-eastern corner.

But Mineral Wells, a small town that straddles Palo Pinto and Parker Counties in north Texas, has a very different claim to fame: in the 19th Century, it was renowned as one of the US’s \"greatest health resorts\"– and it's now once again on the rise as a wellness destination.\nThe small town – designated the official Wellness Capital of Texas  by state legislators in 2023 – has nine underground wells with impressive mineral content. The water, packed full of micronutrients like calcium, potassium, magnesium and lithium, is the only mineral water in Texas suitable for bathing as well as drinking. Visitors have long flocked here to sip and soak in the healing water that has some of the highest mineral content in the world and is renowned for its curative properties.\nBut when Mineral Wells was settled in the late 1800s, early residents had no idea of the bounty beneath their feet. Judge James Alvis Lynch, wife Armanda and their 10 children travelled from Dennison, Texas, to the Millsap Valley in the Palo Pinto Mountains in search of a drier climate to help the couple's rheumatism.\nHowever, they soon tired of walking four miles to retrieve water from a nearby river, and \"the first well in what would become Mineral Wells was dug on their 100-acre homestead in 1880\", said Rose Jordan, director of tourism at Visit Mineral Wells. The family thought the water tasted \"funny\" but started consuming it when it did no harm to their livestock.\nSoon, she said, the Lynches found relief from rheumatism, and the entire family reported better health. The water quickly became renowned for its health benefits, such as allegedly improving digestion and alleviating arthritis, with thousands of people travelling to Mineral Wells to find relief. Lynch started selling the water for $0.05 a cup (about $1.70 in today's time) – and soon had more customers than he could handle.\n\"Since our founding days, Mineral Wells has been built upon the most fundamental of elements – water,\" said Jordan. \"The mineral-rich water from our wells is healthful, healing and pure; it's liquid gold.\"\nThe thousands that came here to drink the water included Ed Dismuke, who had a life-threatening stomach disease. \"His health improved considerably, and in 1904 Dismuke went on to launch the Famous Mineral Water Company, bottling the water that had helped save his life,\" Jordan said.\nAs word spread, more and more people headed to Mineral Wells, and new wells were drilled to facilitate new bathhouses, drinking pavilions and spas. The arrival of trains in 1891 made the city even more popular and spread the water beyond north Texas; in 1900, more than 150,000 visitors flooded in from across the US to bathe and drink in the mineral pools and spas. Mineral Wells became so popular that over the years, what quickly became Texas's premier spa resort town welcomed luminaries like US President Dwight Eisenhower; Lyndon B Johnson (before he was president); and actors Clark Gable, Judy Garland, Roy Rogers, Marlene Dietrich and the Three Stooges.\n\"By 1909, Mineral Wells had seven wells and pavilions, four bathing houses, 46 hotels and boarding houses, and two sanitoriums. It was home to 21 mineral water companies by 1913,\" explained Carol Elder, who now owns Famous Mineral Water Company, which bottles Crazy Water, the only water company still in business in Mineral Wells.\nHowever, the Great Depression and the economic crisis that followed led to a slide in the popularity of mineral springs and wellness resorts. Focus, and travellers, shifted from Mineral Wells and most the town's water companies closed down by the end of the 1940s. The town's economy shifted to a reliance on the nearby military base, Fort Wolters.\nBut now, with increased interest in wellness, spas, fitness centres and retreats catering to a new generation of health-conscious individuals, Mineral Wells is aiming to be what it once was: the place \"where America drinks its way to health\" and a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a wellness getaway.\nMore like this:• Mindfulness retreats: The quiet travel solution to a noisy world• The surprising wellness trend based on beer• An ancient activity that could help ease anxiety \n\"The minerals in our water are naturally occurring; not added or created in some factory.

It has a water bar that serves all the varieties of Crazy Water, as well as Crazy popsicles and a Crazy Fizz Sorbetto Float, made with sorbetto and carbonated Crazy Water.

{"doc_id": 47, "question": "Where did the fifth World Nomad Games take place?", "answer": ["Astana, Kazakhstan"], "doc": "The fifth World Nomad Games kicked off this week in Kazakhstan's capital of Astana. Dubbed the \"Great Gathering on the Steppe\", the Olympics of the nomadic world is a spectacular celebration of traditional sports, identity and culture from across inner Asia.\nPart Highland Games, part Mongolian Naadam festival, and featuring sports like horseback wrestling and Central Asian strongman competitions, the World Nomad Games give a flavour of what the Olympics might have looked like if Genghis Khan had been in charge.\nIndeed, many of the sports have their roots in the skills required to survive on the steppe and in the unrivalled equestrian abilities that fuelled a millennium-long wave of successive steppe empires, from the Huns to the Mongols. There are traditional events such as archery and long-distance horse races, but the Games also promote Kazakh food, traditional dress and even the art of epic storytelling. The goal is to preserve and protect nomadic and steppe culture, which is under increasing threat from globalisation, modernisation and even climate change.\nThe World Nomad Games take place every two years and shifts locations as frequently as the nomads it celebrates. The next event in 2026 will likely head back to Kyrgyzstan, where the inaugural event began in 2014. This year's competition concludes on Friday 13 September.\nThe opening ceremony on 8 September was a spectacular affair, with 3,000 athletes from 89 countries filing into the arena, as hundreds of musicians, dancers and singers performed in front of Central Asia's political elite. The show traced the history of the Kazakh steppe from ancient Scythian warriors and Silk Road merchants to the rise of the Golden Horde and the Kazakh khanate in the 15th Century. Performers depicted scenes of the steppe convening under the symbolic embroidered panels of a yurt (pictured above), a reference to the gatherings of nomadic confederations that occurred periodically to enthrone a new khagan (ruler).\nThis Games favourite – known variously across the region as kokpar, kok buru, ulak tartysh and buzkashi – is best described in English as rugby on horseback with a dead goat as a ball.\nTwo teams of seven horsemen compete to grab hold of the headless carcass (made of rubber for these games), hoist it under their leg, sprint for the opposition's line and then dump it in a ring of rope or a large plastic doughnut. Rough and tumble is putting it mildly; broken fingers and ripped ears are par for the course. \"The most important attribute for a kokpar player is to be strong, to be brave and to not be afraid,\" said the Kazakh team captain, Kermenbek Turganbek.\nOn Thursday, thousands of fans watched home team Kazakhstan beat arch rivals (and ethnic brothers) Kyrgyzstan in the final in extra time.\nHunting with eagles is one of the more unusual of the 21 official sports featured in the Games. It takes many years for an experienced eagle hunter (known as a berkutchi) to tame and train a wild golden eagle (berkut), and the expense and time required makes it the most endangered of the Games' traditional sports.\nThe event has three categories at the competition: hunting with eagles, hawks or falcons. All have their roots in Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and western Mongolia, where the hunting of foxes, rabbits and wolves traditionally takes place in winter when the animals' fur is thickest.\nWrestling on horseback (audaryspak) takes place in a 15m-diameter sandy arena and bouts are divided into six weight categories. The aim is to pull one's opponent onto the ground, but wrestlers can also get points for lifting their opponent from the saddle or pushing them out of the circle. Horses get penalised for biting.\nOther forms of non-horseback wrestling (known as kureshi, kurash or koresh in Turkic languages) include specific Kazakh, Turkish, Tatar and Kyrgyz styles, most of which also include female competitions, unlike many of the Games' sports.\nArchery (both ground and on horseback) is the sport that is perhaps most evocative of inner Asia's warrior past. For centuries waves of mounted archers overwhelmed cities across the Middle East and Eastern Europe, who were left helpless by the steppe people's unrivalled mastery of iron stirrups and composite bows.\n\"Chinggis [Genghis] Khan's blood is in my blood,\" said Mongolian archer Tsetsegsuren Dorjsuren. \"I feel my ancestors when I pick up my bow.\"\nMas-wrestling, sometimes known as stick tug of war, has its roots in Yakutiya (today's Sakha Republic, one of several Turkic republics in the Russian Federation, who attended the 2024 Games.\nAthletes sit facing each other with their feet on a board, both holding a wooden stick, or mas. The aim is to grab the stick from your opponent or pull your opponent over to your side (think: over-sized toddlers fighting over a toy). There are separate men's and women's competitions.\nThe World Nomad Games is about much more than simply sport. At the heart of the half-dozen sporting venues is the Ethno-aul (aul means village in Kazakh), a collection of yurts, craft shops and local restaurants where reenactors dress as medieval warriors and musicians and perform ancient folk songs.\nPicture above, these women in traditional Kazakh dress stand in front of an apple tree in reference to the city’s claim to be the ancestral home of the wild apple; Almaty's Soviet-era name Alma-Ata means \"Grandfather of Apples\".\nOne of the great joys of attending the World Nomad Games is the traditional music that pours out of the concert venues and yurts of the Ethno-aul complex. The most compelling Kazakh performers are its akim, bards or storytellers who recite and improvise epic poems and histories, while playing the dombra, a Kazakh-style lute.\nMore like this: - Qurt: A Kazakh \"cheese of resilience\" - A road trip through Kazakhstan's immense landscapes- The five best things to do in Turkistan\nThe musicians in the above photo are playing the dombra and accordion, the latter the legacy of the long Russian influence in the region.\nAlongside sport and music, the World Nomad Fames aim to preserve artistic and textile traditions through its hosting of master craftspeople, many of whom offer displays and classes in traditional Kazakh handcrafts.\nBulbul Kapkyzy, pictured here with her Soviet-era Lenin carpet, is a master weaver, yurt maker and ethnographer who has been perfecting and teaching for more than 45 years. An ethnic Kazakh born in western Mongolia, she moved to Kazakhstan 20 years ago after independence, during a time of huge ethnic and economic upheaval in post-Soviet Central Asia. \nAstana's ultra-modern architecture seems an unlikely location for a celebration of ancient nomadic culture.\nNomads have traditionally left little architectural legacy, and Kazakhstan's futuristic capital of Astana is quickly making up for lost time. Its well-funded, cutting-edge modern architectural projects by big names such as Norman Foster give it the feel of a Central Asian Dubai, even though its location on the great steppe means that it is the world's second coldest capital city (after Mongolia's Ulaanbaatar).\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

Here, dining isn't just about the food; it's an experience where sparkling waters meet the creativity of some of Australia's top chefs.\nDespite an often-glamorous clientele, you'll find an approach of relaxed sophistication in even the most upmarket of spots. Service is never stiff or overformal, with conviviality and conversation always central to the dining experience. Chefs use indigenous, borrowed and blended flavours, with enormous respect for homegrown ingredients, resulting in a refined cuisine that has a lightness of touch appropriate to the sun-drenched climate.\nFrom tranquil breakfasts through to romantic suppers, locals grab any opportunity to be in proximity to their beloved beaches and bays. And for travellers, these five restaurants offer not just a meal, but an opportunity to savour Sydney at its finest.\nReferring to Quay as \"world class\" barely describes the sum of its glorious parts. With unobstructed views over Sydney's Opera House and Harbour Bridge, this stunningly located restaurant is the perfect home for exquisite dishes that honour organic ingredients. \nExecutive chef Peter Gilmore's obsession with the life cycle of plants, from seed to stamen, is the first clue the diner is in for an exceptional experience. His artful, ethereal cuisine presents like tiny gardens of native vegetables, flowers and fronds, while luxurious rockpools of aquatic fascinations are exquisite in technique and execution. Quay's four-, six- or eight-course menus are served on hand-crafted vessels, and textures dance both on the plate and palate.\nIncredibly, there's no hint of the pomp or pretentiousness usually associated with such temples of culinary art; nary a white cloth on a sleek timber tabletop lest it masks the natural grain.

{"doc_id": 50, "question": "What is the name of the new international airport opening in Greenland’s capital?", "answer": ["Nuuk"], "doc": "Following this summer's heated protests against overtourism, there's some good news. For every overcrowded tourist spot in Europe, there are plenty of places around the world that need more visitors.\nSt Mark's Square in Venice might host more tourists than pigeons, Barcelona has seen aggression against tourists reach a fever pitch and the clifftop paths can in Italy's Cinque Terre can feel like a supermarket queue. However, beyond these (and other) hotspots lie places that are equally rich in culture but without the crowds. Around the world, there are cities crying out for tourists and walking trails where you won't see a soul all day.\nWhile we often hear about the destructive forces of tourism in major cultural destinations, for lesser-developed countries, the money tourism brings in helps to build much-needed infrastructure and community spaces. It offers jobs and training and gives locals a chance to proudly share their country's culture and traditions. Managed well, tourism can be an enriching economic stream, bringing people together around shared values and experiences. It doesn't have to replicate the issues we've seen this summer.\nThese four destinations are just a handful of the countries who are using tourism as a tool to build stronger economies, and welcoming travellers with open arms. \nWith a new international airport opening in the capital, Nuuk, later this year, plus another international landing strip coming in the northern tourist capital of Ilulissat in 2026, Greenland is getting ready to welcome an increasing number of visitors. It marks a turning point in Greenlandic tourism: to date, its international runways have not been long enough to handle large flights, instead routing travellers through Kangerlussuaq, a former US military base, and shuttling them on a smaller plane to onward destinations.\nThe new infrastructure will mean that not only can more tourists fly directly into the capital, but, perhaps more importantly in a country where much is imported, more goods can come in and larger quantities of its export products, including seafood, can go out, hopefully leading to an economic boost for the whole country. Tourism is one way to pay for the airport development as well as provide jobs and stability for the future.\nGreenland is focused on two main forms of tourism, the first being adventure tourism, which includes everything from rock climbing in Eastern Greenland to whale watching and camping on the Greenland Ice Sheet. The other is year-round tourism, which includes an emphasis on dark sky tourism – star gazing and northern lights-watching in particular.\nGetting tourists to experience Greenland in summer has been far easier than doing so in winter; but to enable local people to have year-round jobs, tourists need to come in the off season too. Attracting people to places where the sun barely shines in the peak of winter – and where temperatures can dip to -50C – might seem like a challenge, but the country has made a virtue of it, opening up sky view cabins and igloos for awe-filled aurora-focused experiences.\nTanny Por, head of international relations at Visit Greenland, is keen to emphasise that it's not a question of quantity over quality, noting that the country's goal is that 80% of the population sees tourism as something that offers a positive contribution to society. \"Airports cost a lot, so we do have to encourage a lot of tourists to come,\" she said, \"but we will be doing this in a balanced way, so as not to overrun local people.\"\nPor has just returned from a trip looking at travel opportunities in North Greenland, which will be accessible via direct international flights from 2026 when the new runway in Ilulissat opens.\n\"I went to a tiny town of 1,000 inhabitants, Qasigiannguit, and it was fantastic,\" she said. \"There are musk ox in the backcountry, historical reenactments at the local museum and so many whales! I heard them before I saw them from my bedroom, and they were everywhere we went.\"\nMorocco is another nation keen to welcome more international visitors as it continues to develop its tourism infrastructure and build new hotels ahead of the 2030 World Cup, which it will co-host with Spain and Portugal. The North African country sees the tournament as a golden opportunity to boost tourism and is aiming to double tourist arrivals by 2030, to a whopping 26 million annual visitors.\nIt's estimated that the country will need 100,000 extra beds as a minimum to accommodate the visiting football fans and teams, and it's been busy making up the shortfall with many international hotel chains stepping in to help. A slew of new accommodations will be opening across the country as a result, from the Waldorf Astoria in Tangier to 25 new Radisson Hotels due to open before 2030, along with many re-opening after last year's devastating earthquake. \nBarbara Podbial is a Morocco specialist adviser at travel agency Flee Winter and has been visiting the country for more than 20 years. She's seen the difference tourism has made to the country first hand.\n\"Tourism has had a positive impact in Marrakesh,\" she said. \"You can see it in the cleanliness of the streets, it's very safe, and people are not pushing you to buy things now the way they were before. But, with so many budget flights bringing in tourists, it can feel very busy.\" \nIncreasing flights into Marrakesh is certainly part of the plan when it comes to developing Morocco's tourism industry, so it's unlikely that the city will be quieter any time soon. When it comes to the World Cup, however, the spotlight will fall on the country's lesser visited cities – Casablanca, Agadir, Fez, Rabat and Tangier – where stadiums are being renovated, tourism is being further developed and hotels are being built.\nOf these locations, Barbara recommends Fez, Morocco's cultural capital, which has the largest medina in the world and is not over touristed. She also recommends day tripping from Agadir, a popular package holiday destination, to Taroudant, nicknamed \"little Marrakesh\". \"It's a short drive from Agadir and is an authentic, non-touristy city,\" she said. Also close to Agadir, the coast near the fishing village of Taghazout offers surf lessons on sandy beaches, while those planning a trip to Marrakesh can also include an excursion to the High Atlas mountains, a couple of hours drive away. \nWith the emphasis being thrown on further developing major cities in Morocco, the secret to an authentic holiday there may well be to use them as a base to discover lesser-visited spots nearby.\nSerbia doesn't have to look far to see a travel success story: in neighbouring Croatia, tourism has been a runaway hit. But while the city of Dubrovnik has had troubles with overtourism, Serbia is focusing firmly on sustainable development, working with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council to develop projects that don't encourage mass tourism, but look for a more sensitive, culture-oriented path forward. \nThis is partly because the country's tourism strategy has shifted. In the past, the focus was largely on city experiences, for example in Belgrade. However, with the realisation that tourism can help diversify rural livelihoods and improve local economies, mountain tourism, rural tourism and spa and wellness offerings have become an important part of the mix.\n\"In Serbia, people see the word 'tourist' as a positive thing,\" said George Colvin-Slee, a Serbia specialist adviser at Cox & Kings. \"It's an undiscovered place for a lot of people – we send more people to Albania and Bosnia – but it's got some really impressive spots.\"\nThe country's mountains draw skiers in winter and hikers in summer; ecotourism is developing in the hills along with birdwatching; and natural springs in the foothills feed resorts and wellness hotels. And while tourists are enjoying these nature-packed experiences, local businesses are getting a boost and jobs are getting more secure. It seems to be working: international tourism grew by 20% in 2023.\nMore like this:• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024• Five standout cities making the world a better place• Five countries with the best work-life balance\nColvin-Slee recommends visiting Novi Sad, the country's second city. \"There's Hapsburg heritage in this region, so you'll find chocolate-box buildings like in Prague and Budapest but barely anyone there in terms of tourists. The food is also Austrian-influenced – strudel and goulash – and there are some great sights, including the Petrovaradin Fortress, nicknamed the 'Gibraltar of the Danube'.\"  \nGeorgia, which borders Turkey, Russia and Azerbaijan by the Black Sea, has big plans to encourage everyone from disabled visitors and independent travellers to cruise tourists, with a vast port in Batumi, the country's second city. Its new 10-year development plan takes in everything from developing international signage so tourists can navigate the country solo, to improving accessibility, public transport and cruise ship ports as it opens up.\n\"Tourism is relatively new in Georgia,\" said Natalie Fordham, a Georgia specialist at Wild Frontiers, a tour operator specialising in offbeat and adventurous destinations. \"It offers a relatively new career path and we see really fantastic guides as a result. They're super excited to be part of it, they speak great English and learn how to adapt to different people, and many of our travellers make friends with them and want to go back.\"\nAs a developing tourism nation, some of the things you might take for granted in Western Europe –such as an extensive paved road network – are not there yet. However, there's hope that revenue from tourism will help to drive these kinds of infrastructural initiatives.\n\"Tbilisi is my favourite capital city in the world,\" said Fordham, \"with charming cobbled streets, a real aesthetic, old fortress walls, museums and more. Then you've got cave towns, Soviet architecture and history – Stalin was born here – and the northern and southern mountains, Unesco churches and monasteries, and a thriving wine and food scene. There's so much to see, you need a week-long trip at least.\" \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

Around the world, there are cities crying out for tourists and walking trails where you won't see a soul all day.\nWhile we often hear about the destructive forces of tourism in major cultural destinations, for lesser-developed countries, the money tourism brings in helps to build much-needed infrastructure and community spaces. It offers jobs and training and gives locals a chance to proudly share their country's culture and traditions. Managed well, tourism can be an enriching economic stream, bringing people together around shared values and experiences. It doesn't have to replicate the issues we've seen this summer.\nThese four destinations are just a handful of the countries who are using tourism as a tool to build stronger economies, and welcoming travellers with open arms. \nWith a new international airport opening in the capital, Nuuk, later this year, plus another international landing strip coming in the northern tourist capital of Ilulissat in 2026, Greenland is getting ready to welcome an increasing number of visitors. It marks a turning point in Greenlandic tourism: to date, its international runways have not been long enough to handle large flights, instead routing travellers through Kangerlussuaq, a former US military base, and shuttling them on a smaller plane to onward destinations.\nThe new infrastructure will mean that not only can more tourists fly directly into the capital, but, perhaps more importantly in a country where much is imported, more goods can come in and larger quantities of its export products, including seafood, can go out, hopefully leading to an economic boost for the whole country. Tourism is one way to pay for the airport development as well as provide jobs and stability for the future.\nGreenland is focused on two main forms of tourism, the first being adventure tourism, which includes everything from rock climbing in Eastern Greenland to whale watching and camping on the Greenland Ice Sheet. The other is year-round tourism, which includes an emphasis on dark sky tourism – star gazing and northern lights-watching in particular.\nGetting tourists to experience Greenland in summer has been far easier than doing so in winter; but to enable local people to have year-round jobs, tourists need to come in the off season too. Attracting people to places where the sun barely shines in the peak of winter – and where temperatures can dip to -50C – might seem like a challenge, but the country has made a virtue of it, opening up sky view cabins and igloos for awe-filled aurora-focused experiences.\nTanny Por, head of international relations at Visit Greenland, is keen to emphasise that it's not a question of quantity over quality, noting that the country's goal is that 80% of the population sees tourism as something that offers a positive contribution to society. \"Airports cost a lot, so we do have to encourage a lot of tourists to come,\" she said, \"but we will be doing this in a balanced way, so as not to overrun local people.\"\nPor has just returned from a trip looking at travel opportunities in North Greenland, which will be accessible via direct international flights from 2026 when the new runway in Ilulissat opens.\n\"I went to a tiny town of 1,000 inhabitants, Qasigiannguit, and it was fantastic,\" she said. \"There are musk ox in the backcountry, historical reenactments at the local museum and so many whales! I heard them before I saw them from my bedroom, and they were everywhere we went.\"\nMorocco is another nation keen to welcome more international visitors as it continues to develop its tourism infrastructure and build new hotels ahead of the 2030 World Cup, which it will co-host with Spain and Portugal. The North African country sees the tournament as a golden opportunity to boost tourism and is aiming to double tourist arrivals by 2030, to a whopping 26 million annual visitors.\nIt's estimated that the country will need 100,000 extra beds as a minimum to accommodate the visiting football fans and teams, and it's been busy making up the shortfall with many international hotel chains stepping in to help. A slew of new accommodations will be opening across the country as a result, from the Waldorf Astoria in Tangier to 25 new Radisson Hotels due to open before 2030, along with many re-opening after last year's devastating earthquake. \nBarbara Podbial is a Morocco specialist adviser at travel agency Flee Winter and has been visiting the country for more than 20 years. She's seen the difference tourism has made to the country first hand.\n\"Tourism has had a positive impact in Marrakesh,\" she said. \"You can see it in the cleanliness of the streets, it's very safe, and people are not pushing you to buy things now the way they were before. But, with so many budget flights bringing in tourists, it can feel very busy.\" \nIncreasing flights into Marrakesh is certainly part of the plan when it comes to developing Morocco's tourism industry, so it's unlikely that the city will be quieter any time soon. When it comes to the World Cup, however, the spotlight will fall on the country's lesser visited cities – Casablanca, Agadir, Fez, Rabat and Tangier – where stadiums are being renovated, tourism is being further developed and hotels are being built.\nOf these locations, Barbara recommends Fez, Morocco's cultural capital, which has the largest medina in the world and is not over touristed. She also recommends day tripping from Agadir, a popular package holiday destination, to Taroudant, nicknamed \"little Marrakesh\". \"It's a short drive from Agadir and is an authentic, non-touristy city,\" she said. Also close to Agadir, the coast near the fishing village of Taghazout offers surf lessons on sandy beaches, while those planning a trip to Marrakesh can also include an excursion to the High Atlas mountains, a couple of hours drive away. \nWith the emphasis being thrown on further developing major cities in Morocco, the secret to an authentic holiday there may well be to use them as a base to discover lesser-visited spots nearby.\nSerbia doesn't have to look far to see a travel success story: in neighbouring Croatia, tourism has been a runaway hit. But while the city of Dubrovnik has had troubles with overtourism, Serbia is focusing firmly on sustainable development, working with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council to develop projects that don't encourage mass tourism, but look for a more sensitive, culture-oriented path forward. \nThis is partly because the country's tourism strategy has shifted. In the past, the focus was largely on city experiences, for example in Belgrade. However, with the realisation that tourism can help diversify rural livelihoods and improve local economies, mountain tourism, rural tourism and spa and wellness offerings have become an important part of the mix.\n\"In Serbia, people see the word 'tourist' as a positive thing,\" said George Colvin-Slee, a Serbia specialist adviser at Cox & Kings. \"It's an undiscovered place for a lot of people – we send more people to Albania and Bosnia – but it's got some really impressive spots.\"\nThe country's mountains draw skiers in winter and hikers in summer; ecotourism is developing in the hills along with birdwatching; and natural springs in the foothills feed resorts and wellness hotels. And while tourists are enjoying these nature-packed experiences, local businesses are getting a boost and jobs are getting more secure. It seems to be working: international tourism grew by 20% in 2023.\nMore like this:• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024• Five standout cities making the world a better place• Five countries with the best work-life balance\nColvin-Slee recommends visiting Novi Sad, the country's second city. \"There's Hapsburg heritage in this region, so you'll find chocolate-box buildings like in Prague and Budapest but barely anyone there in terms of tourists. The food is also Austrian-influenced – strudel and goulash – and there are some great sights, including the Petrovaradin Fortress, nicknamed the 'Gibraltar of the Danube'.\"  \nGeorgia, which borders Turkey, Russia and Azerbaijan by the Black Sea, has big plans to encourage everyone from disabled visitors and independent travellers to cruise tourists, with a vast port in Batumi, the country's second city. Its new 10-year development plan takes in everything from developing international signage so tourists can navigate the country solo, to improving accessibility, public transport and cruise ship ports as it opens up.\n\"Tourism is relatively new in Georgia,\" said Natalie Fordham, a Georgia specialist at Wild Frontiers, a tour operator specialising in offbeat and adventurous destinations. \"It offers a relatively new career path and we see really fantastic guides as a result. They're super excited to be part of it, they speak great English and learn how to adapt to different people, and many of our travellers make friends with them and want to go back.\"\nAs a developing tourism nation, some of the things you might take for granted in Western Europe –such as an extensive paved road network – are not there yet. However, there's hope that revenue from tourism will help to drive these kinds of infrastructural initiatives.\n\"Tbilisi is my favourite capital city in the world,\" said Fordham, \"with charming cobbled streets, a real aesthetic, old fortress walls, museums and more. Then you've got cave towns, Soviet architecture and history – Stalin was born here – and the northern and southern mountains, Unesco churches and monasteries, and a thriving wine and food scene. There's so much to see, you need a week-long trip at least.\" \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

{"doc_id": 52, "question": "What is the name of the gin made from apples of Sir Isaac Newton’s apple tree?", "answer": ["Curator's Gin"], "doc": "After more than 300 years, Newton’s law of gravitation is still palpable at a revolutionary Cambridge distillery.\nOn a warm January afternoon, I pedalled down cobblestone streets in Cambridge, England, to a path along the River Cam towards the village of Grantchester. Passing wooden punts in the river, through the weeping willow-fringed Grantchester Meadows, a setting that's inspired many an artist, including Pink Floyd, I set out in search of a spirit with a certain pull.\nBut what I found instead was a gin with gravitas.\nInside a white-brick building, I entered the lofty Cambridge Distillery, which offers tastings as well as a peek into the inner workings of what's been called \"the world's most innovative distillery\". With beakers, round-bottom flasks and white tables, the distillery looks more like a chemistry lab than a traditional distillery outfitted with copper alembic stills.\n \nNamed after its namesake English hometown, Cambridge Distillery was founded by William and Lucy Lowe in 2012. The company has since grown from the UK's smallest distillery to one of the largest dedicated vacuum gin distilleries in the world.\nUnlike the average distiller, William is a Master of Wine, a distinguished title held by just 416 people around the world. (He's also an Ironman triathlete, a Kung Fu black belt and now a Master Distiller and PhD student at Cambridge.) Inspired by oenology and driven by a desire to bottle the seasonal scents and flavours of the surrounding Grantchester Meadows, William has revolutionised gin-making by vacuum distilling each ingredient individually at the optimal temperature. He does this by using a 17th-Century method from British chemist Robert Boyle to blend and customise each gin to perfection, much like a perfumer or master wine maker – hence his moniker \"the world's first gin tailor\".\nHe also developed a unique distillation matrix that considers nine variables (including temperature, timing and pressure) to customise the treatment for each bottle, which is why the distillery looks like a lab. \"It's an incredibly high technological level of intervention in order to preserve that natural and unique combination of flavours, which naturally exist in a meadow,\" said William.\nAs such, the distillery is renowned for producing some of the world's most unique gins, including one derived from red wood ants foraged from Kent (cleverly named Anty Gin) in collaboration with Nordic Food Lab, as well as a citrus-led gin that contains no citrus, and a custom gin for a client who wanted a \"wet dog smell\".\nThey're also the only distillery in the world that crafts gin flavoured by Sir Isaac Newton's apple tree.\nDeveloped in exclusive collaboration with Cambridge University Botanic Garden (CUBG), the spirit, known as Curator's Gin, features rare botanicals like lemon lavender, ginger rosemary and crisp apples from Newton's legendary tree. The citrus, spicy and herbaceous notes fuse into floral fragrance, according to William.  \n\"Being let loose in their garden was quite a treat,\" said Lucy. \"It felt ever so naughty to be picking things.\"\nThe tree is actually a descendent (a clone, technically) of Newton's tree in Woolsthorpe Manor in Lincolnshire, England, Newton's birthplace and family home where allegedly he made his original observation of gravity, among other major discoveries. The apple-falling brainstorm happened in 1665 or 1666 while the University of Cambridge, where he was a mathematics student (and later a professor), was closed due to the bubonic plague. (His theory of gravity, sans apples, was published in his Principia in 1687, and is at the Cambridge University Library.)\n\"In the last two years, Newton's story has resonated with a lot more people,\" said Emma Michalak, operations manager at Woolsthorpe Manor, who maintains one of the holiest pilgrimage sites for scientists and physicists.\nWhile the original tree miraculously still stands and bears fruit after more than 400 years – a true sign of resilience, even if it appears a bit warped and weighed down – its younger scion in Cambridge was razed by Storm Eunice in 2022. Luckily, the Lowes have bottled up enough of the apple essence to sustain production until the new sapling reaches maturity.\nThe seeds of Newton's famous apple tree eventually spread to six continents. \"Newton's tree can be found across the globe, from America to Japan,\" said Michalak. Many of those outside of the UK and Europe, however, are scions of scions.\nThe tree at Woolthorpe flowers in mid- to late-May, and apples are ripe from October. While visitors aren't allowed to pick them, they can take the windfalls. On occasion, the gift shop sells them for 50p each. But don't get too excited. \"A lot of people buy them to try and grow their own Newton's apple tree from the seed,\" said Michalak. But \"the way cross pollination works, that apple seed could be any type of apple that grows. It wouldn't necessarily be a Flower of Kent.\"\nInstead, Michalak recommends baking a pie with the apples that inspired Newton.\nCambridge Distillery's collaboration with CUBG continues to be fruitful and inventive. \"Not to one-up our Curator's Gin, but we also have gin that's inspired by [Charles] Darwin,\" said William.\n\"What most people don't know is that there is a secret level under the Botanic Garden,\" said William, \"concealing some incredibly valuable and important storage.\" This includes the Cambridge University Herbarium, which contains roughly 1,000 200-year-old specimens from Darwin's around-the-world Beagle voyage between 1831-36.\n\"When Darwin was on this voyage, collecting, indexing and recording [plant] samples he was finding along the way, those samples were being sent back to [his mentor John Stevens Henslow at] Cambridge, and they're still there, all of them,\" said William. The Lowes were offered the extraordinary chance to explore the Herbarium through the \"medium of flavour\" and create a gin that brought Darwin's 19th-Century world voyage – the trip that inspired his view of evolution – to life.\nMore like this: • The Arctic circle: A new frontier for sustainable wine • How do restaurants actually get a Michelin star? • The cheeseburger that fuelled the Manhattan Project\nThe first gin released from the three-part Darwin series was the Americas Herbarium in November 2023, which will be followed by Australasia (December 2024) and Africa (2025). The Lowes, together with CUBG professor of evolution Sam Brockington, selected cinnamon leaf, barberry (a zesty citrus alternative), wild strawberry and baccharis magellanica (an Andean shrub from southern Argentina and Chile with intensely aromatic flowers dubbed the \"Christmas Bush\"), to represent the first leg of Darwin's epic journey. As William explained, it coalesces in a full bouquet of flavour: floral, sweet, crisp and fruity with a comforting hint of spice.\nAfter an hour savouring Cambridge Distillery's many creations, I cycled back to my hotel with a bottle of gin dangling from the handlebar in a brown paper bag. The clouds began to break, releasing a drizzle that quickly became a downpour. I rode as fast as possible, trying to cover the paper bag with my jacket. When I finally got to my hotel, the bag, which was inevitably soaked, tore apart. I snatched the bottle before it fell like an apple to the earth, saving it from Newton's Law.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

It was very magical.\"\nTiedemann is hardly alone; the Hamptons – a cluster of luxurious seaside resort towns on the eastern end of New York's Long Island – have long fascinated visitors, who flock to the area for a summertime escape to a world of white linen, cocktail parties and impossibly lavish estates.\nBut Tiedemann appreciates the Hamptons for more than its prestige: \"There's something interesting about the Hamptons, and I'm not sure scientifically what it is,\" she says. \"But the sun sets there and mirrors off both sides of the water, because it's a very long, narrow island.

Last summer, I stayed through the autumn, and it was really cool to go to all those places without having to see five million people. There's little wine bars and vineyards that are really scenic and pretty. And they need business during that time. I almost don't even want to tell the secret of how much nicer it is.\"\nThe food scene in the Hamptons is tied to the bounty of the Atlantic coast – lobster and clams reign supreme – as well as the island's thriving farm culture. Farm-to-table experiences abound, as do glamorous restaurants with dishes (and patrons) ripped straight from the pages of a celebrity magazine. But there are down to earth delights as well – chef-approved.\nHere are Tiedemann's top culinary experiences in the Hamptons – in summertime and beyond.\nThe Hamptons are notorious for being wildly posh. For a spendy yet still \"really cool\" experience, Tiedemann likes The Crow's Nest on Montauk Lake. \"This place is sick,\" declares Tiedemann. \"The first time I went there, me and my friend were, like, we just entered a dreamscape.\"\nThe Crow's Nest restaurant, an opulent wood-on-wood coastal oasis in the Crow's Nest Hotel serves upscale New American and Mediterranean-inspired seafood dishes. \"It almost has a tiki vibe, but that's not what it is. The food is really good; really fresh seafood,\" says Tiedemann. \"There's a little beach with a little beach bar on it, and it's overlooking the water. It's just so perfect and pretty. And because of the Hamptons light thing, you feel like you're sitting in the most beautiful place you've ever seen, having a perfect cocktail surrounded by people in flowy white outfits… amazing!\"\nTiedemann's Crow's Nest pick is the tuna tartare with black caramel, cucumber, radish, smoked mango and avocado. \"It was crazy good,\" she says. \"They wouldn't tell me what they did, but it was so good. I would go back anytime.\"\nWebsite: https://www.crowsnestmtk.com/Address: 4 Old West Lake Dr, Montauk, NY 11954Phone: +16316682077Instagram: @crowsnestmtkWalk-ins only\nWhile in the Hamptons, day trippers, summer residents and celebs alike devour fresh New England seafood. Like lobster rolls – hunks of succulent lobster meat stuffed in a griddled split-top hot dog bun, dressed in mayonnaise (Maine style) or melted butter (New England style). Personal chefs love the coastal delicacy, too: \"This summer, I went on a quest to find the best lobster roll ever,\" says Tiedemann. The winners? Shinnecock Lobster Factory and Bostwick's on the Harbor.\nShinnecock Lobster Factory, a burgundy-painted wooden shack on the Shinnecock Indian reservation in Southampton, serves all manner of seafood delights, from fish burgers to lobster mac and cheese. But for Tiedemann, its lobster roll is king. \"I love a lobster roll,\" she says. \"I don't really like mayo. I hate it when places only offer mayo. People are afraid to be creative with the lobster roll because it's so culturally tied. I don't [care]. I just want it to be good.\"\nLobster roll lovers will not only find classic lobster rolls with and without mayonnaise, but a slew of inventive rolls, like the Diablo with spicy tomatoes, in a variety of sizes. \"So you're not committing,\" says Tiedemann. \"That was a smart move on their behalf, and it's really good.\"\nAlternatively, Bostwick's on the Harbor in East Hampton serves the quintessential lobster roll: \"The straight up classic. It's butter, it's lobster meat, it's a good bun. It's a greasy experience, and it's supposed to be.\"\nWebsite: https://shinnecocklobsterfactory.com/Address: 42 Montauk Hwy, Southampton, NY 11968Phone: +16312593334Instagram: @shinnecocklobster\nWebsite: https://www.bostwicksontheharbor.com/Address: 39 Gann Rd, East Hampton, NY 11937Phone: +16313241150Instagram: @bostwicks_on_the_harbor\nLittle about the Hamptons can be deemed casual, but Tiedemann has a spot for when you just need to hang loose. \"I love the Clam Bar,\" she says. \"You're gonna sit out there with your friends and you're gonna drink beer out of a can and eat fried clams.\"\nThe Clam Bar, a fish shack on Montauk Highway heading east out of Amagansett, has been feeding stomachs and souls for more than 40 years with fresh New England seafood dishes; both traditional (clam chowder, oysters on the half shell) and not (sushi dogs, tuna poke nachos).\n\"The Clam Bar is really fun,\" says Tiedemann. \"It's very iconic when you see that place; it looks like somewhere you'd want to stop on a drive. It's all outside seating, but there's always a lot of people there. You just drive up, very casual. Sit outside.\"\nTiedemann's order? \"The clam strips… it's just a good vibe and it's solid food.\"\nWebsite: https://clambarhamptons.com/Address: 2025 Montauk Hwy, Amagansett, NY 11930Phone: +16312676348Instagram: @theclambar\nTiedemann's recommendation for a quick yet gourmet meal is Round Swamp Farm country market; a collective of farm stands that also sells prepared foods. \"Out [in the Hamptons], it can be really difficult to find a quick bite,\" says Tiedemann. \"As a chef, I stop there to pick up ingredients and [it's] where I get lunch, too.\"\nAmong the market's vast variety of offerings are savoury dishes like seared salmon, mushroom lasagna and shrimp po' boys, while sweet tooths can find cookies, pies and muffins; perfect for a nosh between extravagant summer parties or an impromptu picnic on the seashore.\n\"They're cooking them constantly and refreshing them, because it has a cult following,\" says Tiedemann. \"You might have to elbow somebody to get your tacos. And they have such a range; you can get a fried chicken sandwich, you can get sesame noodles, you can get a salad. You could get a pizza sometimes, and it's really good.

Luckily, this means making basking in the island's explosion of produce.\n\"There's so many farms out in the Hamptons. It's a very seasonal place; that's why we have immaculate farm stands,\" says Tiedemann. \"There's one that I found last summer that no one had ever spoken to me about. It's called Serene Green. It's kind of a Hampton's secret.\"\nVisitors to the Hamptons typically spend much time in houses, whether in palatial celebrity mansions or group-funded Airbnbs. And whether there's a private chef or you're doing the cooking yourself, stocking up on heirloom tomatoes, berries and apples is as much a part of the Hamptons experience as wearing summer whites.\n\"Lots of the farm stands will have something you're looking for, but not everything,\" says Tiedemann. \"Serene Green, you can go in there and get literally everything to make dinner. They even have seafood from the fishermen, all the vegetables, and they have a little shop inside with dairy, different cheeses, pastas, grains, olive oil. And it's an adorable place. They have coffee and lemonade and cookies. You can just sit and have a snack. It's great.\" Located in the sleepy hamlet of Noyack, Serene Green is run by local farmer John Smith, whose family has lived in the area since the 1640s.\n\"I just love food,\" says Tiedemann. \"I love trying new things.

{"doc_id": 54, "question": "Where does the World Stone Skimming Championships take place?", "answer": ["Easdale Island near Oban in Argyll"], "doc": "Not all rock stars play guitars: every September, the Hebridean island of Easdale plays host to the world's most fanatical stone skimmers.\nIt was pouring, hard and heavy. The rain was falling like marbles, the wind was whirling and the air was thick with the reek of whisky. At the heart of this scene was Lynsay McGeachy, competitive amateur golfer, mountain biker and head gin distiller at Beinn an Tuirc in Kintyre, and she was the image of cool as she prepared to take centre stage.\nThe mood was electric, like a rock concert, with the gathered crowd heckling support. But McGeachy was not listening, nor preparing to tee-off, mountain bike or take part in any other everyday sport. She was about to skim a stone, feeling its cold hard edges on her fingertips, clinging to it with competitive seriousness. \nSeconds later, following a waist-high baseball-style pitch, the flat-bottomed slate pebble spun 42m across the waterlogged quarry in front of her, hovering and zinging through the air as if a drunken dragonfly. It twirled into the air 15 times. In her own words, it was an \"absolute belter\".\n\"I'm struggling to find stones to train with this year because I've thrown so many away,\" said McGeachy, who estimates she skims some 160 rocks each week during her practice sessions on Torrisdale Beach in Kintyre, a peninsula on Scotland's south-west coast.

{"doc_id": 55, "question": "What is the predominant grape used in Ribeira Sacra for winemaking?", "answer": ["Mencía"], "doc": "In the Ribeira Sacra's dizzyingly high landscapes, near-vertical vineyards are perched above rivers. The stunning scenery – and the resulting wines – are an oenophile's dream.\nA mosaic of stone and trees, the mountains stretched out toward the horizon while below me the river sliced through this unyielding mass of granite as if it were made of sponge. Peering down the pitched slopes of the Sil Canyon from the Cabezoás overlook – more than 700m high – I gained new respect for the incredible power of water (while thanking the sturdy beams that were holding me up).\nVertiginous views are a hallmark of the Ribeira Sacra, a collection of small towns that mostly hug the Sil and Miño rivers in Galicia, Spain's north-westernmost region. Galicia is often referred to as \"green Spain\" for its verdant landscapes, the product of frequent rainfall compared to elsewhere in Spain, but it's these two rivers that have shaped the Ribeira Sacra, the region’s most inland corner. The name means \"sacred riverbank\" in the Galician language, a nod to both the topography and the area's long monasterial history, dating to Roman times.\nIt's not the easiest terrain to cross, filled with narrow winding roads that wrap around hills and cut through stands of chestnuts and oaks. As I left Cabezoás, I headed west to the region's main monastery, Santo Estevo de Ribas de Sil, about 7km away as the crow flies, but nearly double the distance by car. Nested high above the Sil River, Santo Estevo has been beautifully restored and is now part of Spain's national network of paradores (state-run hotels often housed in historic structures). Although it is first mentioned in documents from the 10th Century, the monastery is believed to be several centuries older than that. It includes three cloisters, a church and the monks' quarters, and I couldn't help but wonder how they built such a massive compound back then on the rim of a mountain\nThose monks definitely had an eye for prime real estate, but the miradoiros (scenic overlooks) I passed along the way provided a different kind of religious experience. Like Cabezoás, they jut out over the edges of cliffs, mocking gravity and offering vistas that will fill your heart or stop it cold, depending on how you feel about heights. Water has forged its own green cathedrals here, more monumental than even the most spectacular structures built by humans.\nIn fact, the Ribeira Sacra was declared a biosphere reserve in 2022, and it is Spain's only nomination for Unesco World Heritage status in 2024. The application revolves around the central place of water in this landscape. Beyond the production of hydroelectric power, the rivers have propelled a long history of milling – corn and other grains – but it's the nearly vertical vineyards along their banks that play a starring role.\nWinemaking took off after the arrival of the Romans and the monastic orders that followed them. The region's predominant grape is Mencía, traditionally used to make fresh, young reds, though winemakers are increasingly adding a little Brancellao, Sousón, and Caíño, and even aging some of these earthy, aromatic blends, as well as producing beautifully floral whites starring the Godello grape. For a long time, wine quality suffered here, hindered by rural poverty and tangled land-inheritance laws, but the Ribeira Sacra's star has risen sharply over the past decade, with connoisseurs now seeking out its boutique bottlings.\nIt is also a naturally sustainable wine region, as no other approach would work over the long term. Because of the terrain, grape growers must harvest by hand, carrying heavy crates on their shoulders, as they advance carefully down row after acrophobia-inducing row of vines. To help with this gruelling work, a few vineyards use rails, along which grapes can be moved in small motorised containers – either up toward narrow clearings where they can be loaded onto a truck, or down to the river for boat transport – but this is not an option for most.\nEstablished as an official wine region in 1996, the Ribeira Sacra holds \"heroic viticulture\" designation, awarded by an Italian nonprofit that promotes and protects mountainous wine regions around the world. To qualify for the title, your terraced vineyards must have a minimum altitude of 500m and a gradient above 30%. When I met winemaker Puri Díaz Ferreiro, she casually referred to local vineyards as paredes (walls), which makes sense when you consider that a 70% slope is not unusual. She rightly marvelled at what must have gone into creating these terraces. \"It was an immense job to build these walls and ensure they don't collapse. They've lasted for centuries.\"\nMost wineries here are small operations, like Díaz Ferreiro’s Val do Frade, based in the town of A Pobra do Brollón. Working alone, she grows grapes on two half-hectare plots, one of them perched on a luxuriantly green ridge high above the Sil River. During harvest, she hires extra hands to move her grapes to the Adegas de Vilachá complex 2km away, where she produces just 3,000 bottles per year of a young red made with Mencía. Now an ethnographic centre, these rustic cellars date to medieval times and were traditionally used by families to make and store wine for their own consumption. Every midday, folks would head there on foot, via a narrow path, and bring home enough wine for the day's meals. While the complex has 42 separate cellars, just 12 are currently in use, and Díaz Ferreiro's is the sole commercial operation. \nHer vineyards can only be accessed on foot, from above. While I found the lush highland scenery to be breathtaking, I wanted to get closer to the water, so I headed west to the village of Belesar to meet Martín Martínez. Established in 2020, his Ecosacra winery is what's known locally as an adega de garda (storage winery), where wine that's been made elsewhere is kept in cool, north-facing cellars. More than three centuries old, his adega had been abandoned for 14 years when he bought and restored it, even reusing old wine barrels to make shelving and tables. It's a beautifully rustic space overlooking the Miño River, with an outdoor patio where you can try his wines – a white made with the Godello grape and a red Mencía-dominated blend – while dining on local cheese, charcuterie and empanadas (Galician large-format baked meat or fish pies), accompanied by tomatoes, figs and cherries from his own garden.\nTo reach Ecosacra, I booked a tour that included a magical journey on Martínez's small boat. As we glided past forested riverbanks so densely green they could pass for Tolkien's Shire, I was humbled by the view of those mindboggling vineyards; it was beyond me how those first grape-growers ever conceived of farming this terrain. But even more remarkable was the canyon itself, a testament to the sheer force of water across geological time.\nEcosacra's name reflects Martínez's commitment to protecting his natural resources. Like Díaz Ferreiro, he takes a low-intervention approach in his vineyards, conserving the soil's health and using no herbicides or insecticides, and his small catamaran is the first hybrid passenger boat in the area. As we chatted, he proudly told me about the otters that were spotted near his private pier. \"I spend most days on the river, but I never get bored of this place. It’s paradise to me.\"\nThe team behind local event company I-Radia Crea felt the same way when they created 17 Grados, a music festival that highlights the landscape. Named for the vineyards' minimum slope in degrees, the lineup features concerts at a hilltop winery, but the most coveted events take place on a catamaran with a maximum capacity of 100. Listening to music while cruising between the steep walls of the Sil Canyon is a transcendent experience, transporting you physically and metaphorically. \nMore like this:• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024• How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism• A new record at the world's biggest snail-eating festival\nTo protect the very qualities that make the area so unique, government officials are beginning to take a more mindful approach, learning hard lessons from other parts of Spain where overtourism has sparked the rage of local residents. In its promotional materials, the tourism board encourages visitors to arrive by RENFE, the national train system, which stops in the region’s largest municipality, Monforte de Lemos (population: 18,000). There are also free hop-on hop-off minibus shuttles to reduce car traffic during the summer and Holy Week peak seasons; and the most popular attractions – such as the ancient Santa Cristina de Ribas de Sil monastery and the wineries themselves – require advance reservations to manage visitor volume.\nIt's not easy to balance environmental protection with the real economic needs of the Ribeira Sacra's small towns, which might otherwise be abandoned, like so many in rural Spain. But in a region where survival has long depended on nature, there is still a deep connection to the environment, and many locals are focused on conserving what they've inherited. When Díaz Ferreiro first started growing grapes, some of her neighbours would describe the ways they pruned each plant in their vineyards.\nAt the time, she couldn't imagine anyone having such an intimate understanding of individual vines, but now she has become one of those people. \"I don’t know how to explain it, but it is something that you just have to feel,\" she said. \"We are in contact with the earth, the plants and everything else around us. I’m part of this landscape.\"\n--- \nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

As I left Cabezoás, I headed west to the region's main monastery, Santo Estevo de Ribas de Sil, about 7km away as the crow flies, but nearly double the distance by car. Nested high above the Sil River, Santo Estevo has been beautifully restored and is now part of Spain's national network of paradores (state-run hotels often housed in historic structures). Although it is first mentioned in documents from the 10th Century, the monastery is believed to be several centuries older than that. It includes three cloisters, a church and the monks' quarters, and I couldn't help but wonder how they built such a massive compound back then on the rim of a mountain\nThose monks definitely had an eye for prime real estate, but the miradoiros (scenic overlooks) I passed along the way provided a different kind of religious experience. Like Cabezoás, they jut out over the edges of cliffs, mocking gravity and offering vistas that will fill your heart or stop it cold, depending on how you feel about heights. Water has forged its own green cathedrals here, more monumental than even the most spectacular structures built by humans.\nIn fact, the Ribeira Sacra was declared a biosphere reserve in 2022, and it is Spain's only nomination for Unesco World Heritage status in 2024. The application revolves around the central place of water in this landscape. Beyond the production of hydroelectric power, the rivers have propelled a long history of milling – corn and other grains – but it's the nearly vertical vineyards along their banks that play a starring role.\nWinemaking took off after the arrival of the Romans and the monastic orders that followed them. The region's predominant grape is Mencía, traditionally used to make fresh, young reds, though winemakers are increasingly adding a little Brancellao, Sousón, and Caíño, and even aging some of these earthy, aromatic blends, as well as producing beautifully floral whites starring the Godello grape. For a long time, wine quality suffered here, hindered by rural poverty and tangled land-inheritance laws, but the Ribeira Sacra's star has risen sharply over the past decade, with connoisseurs now seeking out its boutique bottlings.\nIt is also a naturally sustainable wine region, as no other approach would work over the long term. Because of the terrain, grape growers must harvest by hand, carrying heavy crates on their shoulders, as they advance carefully down row after acrophobia-inducing row of vines. To help with this gruelling work, a few vineyards use rails, along which grapes can be moved in small motorised containers – either up toward narrow clearings where they can be loaded onto a truck, or down to the river for boat transport – but this is not an option for most.\nEstablished as an official wine region in 1996, the Ribeira Sacra holds \"heroic viticulture\" designation, awarded by an Italian nonprofit that promotes and protects mountainous wine regions around the world. To qualify for the title, your terraced vineyards must have a minimum altitude of 500m and a gradient above 30%. When I met winemaker Puri Díaz Ferreiro, she casually referred to local vineyards as paredes (walls), which makes sense when you consider that a 70% slope is not unusual. She rightly marvelled at what must have gone into creating these terraces. \"It was an immense job to build these walls and ensure they don't collapse. They've lasted for centuries.\"\nMost wineries here are small operations, like Díaz Ferreiro’s Val do Frade, based in the town of A Pobra do Brollón. Working alone, she grows grapes on two half-hectare plots, one of them perched on a luxuriantly green ridge high above the Sil River. During harvest, she hires extra hands to move her grapes to the Adegas de Vilachá complex 2km away, where she produces just 3,000 bottles per year of a young red made with Mencía. Now an ethnographic centre, these rustic cellars date to medieval times and were traditionally used by families to make and store wine for their own consumption. Every midday, folks would head there on foot, via a narrow path, and bring home enough wine for the day's meals. While the complex has 42 separate cellars, just 12 are currently in use, and Díaz Ferreiro's is the sole commercial operation. \nHer vineyards can only be accessed on foot, from above. While I found the lush highland scenery to be breathtaking, I wanted to get closer to the water, so I headed west to the village of Belesar to meet Martín Martínez. Established in 2020, his Ecosacra winery is what's known locally as an adega de garda (storage winery), where wine that's been made elsewhere is kept in cool, north-facing cellars. More than three centuries old, his adega had been abandoned for 14 years when he bought and restored it, even reusing old wine barrels to make shelving and tables. It's a beautifully rustic space overlooking the Miño River, with an outdoor patio where you can try his wines – a white made with the Godello grape and a red Mencía-dominated blend – while dining on local cheese, charcuterie and empanadas (Galician large-format baked meat or fish pies), accompanied by tomatoes, figs and cherries from his own garden.\nTo reach Ecosacra, I booked a tour that included a magical journey on Martínez's small boat. As we glided past forested riverbanks so densely green they could pass for Tolkien's Shire, I was humbled by the view of those mindboggling vineyards; it was beyond me how those first grape-growers ever conceived of farming this terrain. But even more remarkable was the canyon itself, a testament to the sheer force of water across geological time.\nEcosacra's name reflects Martínez's commitment to protecting his natural resources. Like Díaz Ferreiro, he takes a low-intervention approach in his vineyards, conserving the soil's health and using no herbicides or insecticides, and his small catamaran is the first hybrid passenger boat in the area. As we chatted, he proudly told me about the otters that were spotted near his private pier. \"I spend most days on the river, but I never get bored of this place. It’s paradise to me.\"\nThe team behind local event company I-Radia Crea felt the same way when they created 17 Grados, a music festival that highlights the landscape. Named for the vineyards' minimum slope in degrees, the lineup features concerts at a hilltop winery, but the most coveted events take place on a catamaran with a maximum capacity of 100. Listening to music while cruising between the steep walls of the Sil Canyon is a transcendent experience, transporting you physically and metaphorically. \nMore like this:• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024• How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism• A new record at the world's biggest snail-eating festival\nTo protect the very qualities that make the area so unique, government officials are beginning to take a more mindful approach, learning hard lessons from other parts of Spain where overtourism has sparked the rage of local residents.

Solid family homes, robustly restored city walls and weather-beaten cliffs give a tight-knit, fortress vibe. But where this ancient settlement faces west, towards the small island of St Kirik, Sozopol throws welcoming arms around its natural harbour, offering sailors a safe port of call along this choppy stretch of the Black Sea coast.\nSozopol is now one of Bulgaria's most popular resorts, with medieval churches and wide sandy beaches. But it is that embracing harbour that first brought travelling ancient Greeks to Sozopol more than 2,500 years ago. The town's modern name derives from the Greek for \"City of Salvation\", but in the first millennium BC it was called Apollonia Pontica (Apollo of the Black Sea) after the great Greek Sun god Apollo. Apollonia Pontica grew into a bustling port city, complete with a substantial temple to Apollo, and a 13m-tall bronze image of the god. As far as ancient Greek statues go, this was second in size only to the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Famous throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, Apollonia Pontica's giant statue featured on the city's coins and was eventually stolen by the Romans.\nOn a sunny, early spring day, it can be hard to imagine the dangers of sailing the Black Sea. But for both ancient and modern seafarers, this area can be treacherous, says Nayden Prahov, director of the Sozopol-based Centre for Underwater Archaeology. \"It's a risky sailing route, because of the southern winds on the Black Sea,\" Prahov tells me when I meet him on his dive boat Hristina, anchored among the blue and white fishing boats that line the harbour. \"This is the first safe harbour between the Bosphorus and the Balkan Mountains.\"\nPrahov explains that back in Antiquity, the entrance into the port was through a narrow opening at the northern end, now closed off by a breakwater. This would not have been easy to navigate; but once inside, the ships were safe, sheltered between the peninsula and St Kirik Island. \"This is the reason that the symbol of Apollonia Pontica is the anchor,\" Prahov adds with a smile.\nThe result is a thick layer of what was once rubbish – mostly thousands of pieces of broken pottery, from utilitarian jars to finely-painted drinking cups – but is now an invaluable source of information and evidence about one of the greatest ports on the ancient Black Sea.\nApollonia Pontica was founded by Greeks from Miletus, now in western Turkey, in 610BC. They were pioneers in a vast movement of people and ideas, a process described by some as \"Greek colonisation\" that lasted from the 8th to the 6th Century BC and saw dozens if not hundreds of settlements established around the Mediterranean and the Black Sea – as far west as southern Spain and as far east as Georgia.\nApollonia Pontica was one of the first such colonies on the Black Sea. The safety of its port played a central part in transforming the sea once known to the Greeks as the Pontos Axeinos, or the \"Inhospitable Sea\", into the Pontos Euxeinos, or \"Hospitable\" one. But the Greeks did not arrive in a deserted land. This part of the world was home to the Thracians, a powerful, confident civilisation. And the trade between the local population and the Greek settlers was at the heart of the city's growth and prosperity: in exchange for grain, salt, timber and copper ore from the local mines, the Greeks brought sought-after produce from the Mediterranean, in particular olive oil and wine. During the excavations, local archaeologists have even found a glass perfume bottle from the Roman period with oily perfume still intact inside.\nYou don't have to look far to find that Mediterranean influence still alive and well among the cobbled streets and seafront tavernas of Sozopol today. Locals and visitors alike compete for the best harbour-side tables, laden with a fusion of Balkan and Greek cuisine: grilled fish, taramasalata, mussels and saganaki, and of course, the ever-reliable \"Greek\" salad.\nMore like this:• Unearthing Plovdiv, the modern heart of ancient Thrace• Bulgaria's unlikely new digital nomad hub• Europe’s city of dawdlers and loafers\nSozopol's Mediterranean character is not a fossilised relic of the long-lost ancient world that Prahov and his team are so busy uncovering. Remarkably, along with other Black Sea fishing villages that trace their origin back to Greek colonies, Sozopol remained majority Greek-speaking well into the early 20th Century, until population exchanges across the Balkans saw most of the town's ethnic Greeks abandon their homes and move to Greece itself.\nSome, however, remained, as Aspasia Porozhanova confirms when I sit down with her outside the Fishermen's Association clubhouse. As the Sun sets over the harbour, Porozhanova is at pains to point out that all Sozopolitans are proud Bulgarians, but that a small number of families are also determinedly hanging on to their Greek heritage. \"It's difficult to answer, 'Who are we?' or 'How long have we been here?' But we are all proud of our lineage. It's what unites us, that we are from ancient Apollonia.\"\nDelightfully, Porozhanova shares her first name with the infamous concubine of Perikles, the great ancient Athenian leader. \"I'm named after my grandmother,\" she explains, \"as she was named after hers, and my granddaughter is named after me. So we pass our names down within the family.\" To my fascination, she and her friends share a few words in Sozopolitan Greek, a unique dialect that most Greeks would struggle to understand. \nMy time with Porozhanova ends on a sweet note.

{"doc_id": 57, "question": "What is the name of the mythical wolf said to dwell along the South Nahanni River?", "answer": ["Waheela"], "doc": "He's survived adventures all over the globe – sometimes, barely. Here are his top outdoor escapes in his homeland of Canada, from dogsledding in Inuvik to hot tent camping in Temagami.\nFrom the sweeping prairies and lush forests of the Rocky Mountains to the crystalline glacial lakes and turquoise splendour of the Northwest Pacific Ocean, Canada has become a world-renowned symbol of nature, unspoilt beauty and brutality. Its frigid winters, harsh terrains, often aggressive wildlife and vast expanses of untouched land can make embarking into the Canadian wild feel like taking a leap of faith into the great, moody unknown.\nFew have understood and experienced this duality better than Ontario native Les Stroud, who has built a 30-year career teaching people how to both survive and enjoy Canada's wilderness. \"We have done our damage,\" he admits. \"But we are blessed with areas that are still pristine. We offer the kind of wilderness experience that has been dreamed about since the days of Charles Dickens.\"\nStroud, in many ways, is \"the\" expert survivor. His TV series, Survivorman, which aired from 2001 to 2016, ushered in a generation of similarly themed reality shows, documentaries and, most recently, TikTok influencers, by finessing the art of both experiencing survival and espousing it to a broader public.\nBut \"survivor\" is a term with which Stroud has an uneasy relationship.\n\"I'm an outdoor adventurer,\" he affirms. \"Survival sucks – you don't ever want to have to do survival. It's like knowing first aid. Ultimately, I'm all about connecting to nature.\"\nHere are Stroud's top five Canadian outdoor adventures.\nStraddling the border between the Yukon and Northwest Territories, the 560km South Nahanni River is an open-air gallery of glorious Canadian landscapes, from the giant Virginia Falls to its Grand Canyons; the Rabbitkettle Hotsprings to 350,000-year-old caves. With its abundance of geological treasures, the River's National Park Reserve was one of the first four Natural Heritage Sites listed by Unesco almost 40 years ago.\n\"It's the most epic canoe trip anyone can do,\" Stroud says. \"Every corner of the river is breathtaking. You keep thinking you're not going to see anything better than what you just saw, and you just do.\" \nPlanning a trip to the South Nahanni isn't \"the cheapest outdoor adventure,\" Stroud warns. \"But it's a big box to check off… a basic skill set will get you down the river, and you can paddle on your own.

{"doc_id": 58, "question": "What is the name of the new long-distance hiking route in Wadi Rum?", "answer": ["The Wadi Rum Trail"], "doc": "It traces the stunning, extraterrestrial landscape featured in films like Star Wars and Dune, while helping to preserve traditional Bedouin culture.\nMy Bedouin guide Abdallah led the way up and into the crags of Jebel Umm Ishrin (1,753m), the sheer, eastern wall of Jordan's most spectacular valley: Wadi Rum. Though it's considered one of the world's most breathtaking desert landscapes today, few outsiders had ever heard of Wadi Rum in 1917 when British archaeologist and writer TE Lawrence travelled through, describing this eastern wall as \"one massive rampart of redness\".\nForty-five years later, his journey inspired the film Lawrence of Arabia, which effectively introduced Wadi Rum to the outside world.\nLong before Lawrence, local Bedouin scrambled to dizzying heights on these cliffs, blazing vertiginous paths to needle the mountains' narrowest gaps, reaching their innermost fissures and skirting their dome-capped summits on the hunt for ibex.\nAs Abdallah and I followed in their footsteps, clambering up the cleft of Umm Ejil (also known as Rakhabat Canyon), the passage narrowed and rock walls popped with weathered niches and delicate natural columns, as if marking the approach to an ancient shrine. Panting, I dropped to a black sandstone bench to rest beside Abdallah. We were deep in the heart of Jebel Umm Ishrin, engulfed in its silence, until a human-like whistle suddenly broke the quiet. I craned my neck to scan the surrounding cliffs. Such high, hidden reaches have long been considered the hideouts of magical jinn (genies).\nAbdallah smiled: a starling, he explained. Their two-part whistle is a familiar sound in the surrounding Hisma plateau.\nOf the area's hundreds of miles of red-sand desert, the bulk of which stretches beyond the Saudi border, it's Jordan's fortuitous sliver that is by far the best known. It's this stretch, centred on the Unesco-inscribed Wadi Rum Protected Area, that a bewitched Lawrence described as \"magically haunted\" and \"vast and echoing and God-like\". In recent decades, this extraterrestrial terrain has served as the backdrop of numerous blockbuster films, including Prometheus (2012), The Martian (2015), Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) and Dune (2021 and 2024).\nIt was also here, after years of careful scouting by a group of Bedouin and British friends, that a brand-new long-distance hiking route was unveiled in February 2023: The Wadi Rum Trail. This 10-day, clockwise circuit twists 120km from Jebel Umm Ishrin, encompassing the best of Wadi Rum's dreamlike landscapes, venturing far beyond the well-trodden 4x4 paths and into the heart of the Protected Area. As one of the trail's co-creators, Ben Hoffler, explained, it's a rich amalgam of Bedouin trails: \"Among the pathways it links are walking tracks, shepherding tracks, camel tracks, hunting routes, smuggling routes [and] part of the old darb al-hajj (pilgrimage route) to Mecca.\"\nHoffler has spent more than a decade blazing mountain paths in the region, including Egypt's Sinai and Red Sea Mountain trails and the Bedouin Trail – a transcontinental 1,200km route linking Jordan to Upper Egypt. Still, for Hoffler, there's a distinct and enduring allure to Wadi Rum. \"The mountains tower up and soar up in a way that has a grandeur that I haven't seen in other parts of the Hisma plateau. [Wadi Rum] also cradles a Bedouin culture that remains in many ways more traditional than what you'll find in the Saudi Arabian parts of the Hisma… It has a special feeling.\"\nLike the ingenious Nabatean civilisation that built Petra many centuries before them, the Zalabieh (the most prominent Bedouin community within the Protected Area today) were drawn to Wadi Rum by the perennial springs that trickle at the base of Jebel Rum – the majestic massif that towers over the valley just opposite Jebel Umm Ishrin. Sprouting with wild mint thickets, the rock walls around the springs are adorned with ancient Thamudic and Greek inscriptions along with several distinctly Nabatean shrines.\nYet, until only a few generations ago, the Bedouin village located at the base of Jebel Rum was little more than a huddle of goat-hair tents. Thanks to government efforts since the 1930s, the majority of the Bedouin here (as elsewhere in Jordan) have now permanently settled, with SUVs effectively replacing camels and 4x4 tourism driving the local economy. Most such tours head south, following the valley along a virtual highway of tracks.\nBy contrast, the Wadi Rum Trail climbs east into the twisting bowels of the mountains, losing the crowds from the start. Ten days later, it ends where it began, with increasingly hair-raising abseils down the face of Jebel Rum landing you back at the springs.\nClimber and adventurer Tony Howard was first drawn to Wadi Rum in the 1980s and has since played a pivotal role in putting Wadi Rum on the tourism map. In exploring and publishing the region's first climbing routes, he struck up lasting friendships with Zalabieh members and was deeply impressed by their hospitality and knowledge of the steep terrain.\nAfter Howard and Hoffler hiked the Sinai Trail together in Egypt, the two began collaborating with Howard's friends in Wadi Rum – among them Zalabieh elders – to create a similar long-distance trail in Jordan.\nLike Hoffler's other projects in Egypt, the Wadi Rum Trail was designed with both hikers and locals in mind. Though tackling the trail on your own is permitted, the creators are convinced that the most rewarding experience is to be had in the company of Bedouin guides.\n\"The Wadi Rum Trail first and foremost pays homage to the Bedouin of Wadi Rum,\" said Howard. \"They know the area, its flora and fauna intimately from ancestral knowledge – and they are always good company and good fun!\"\nMore like this: • The King's Highway: The road that reveals Jordan's history • 373 miles of secret treasures • Jordan's beautiful, cursed landscape\n\"There are many hearts in this path,\" said one such Zalabieh elder, Sabbah Eid. \"[It's a] beautiful experience with nature and the life of the Bedouin, far from communication and modern life… it gives a special spirit to the place – complete calm.\" As Eid explained, much of the impetus for the trail's creation was to support the Bedouin community, connecting \"a new generation of young people to work on this path – instead of working with tours on cars\".\nHoffler believes that Bedouin-led efforts like the Wadi Rum Trail can help preserve the Bedouin's natural environment and cultural heritage. \"If history have shown us anything it's that the Bedouin known how to live sustainably in the wilderness,\" Hoffler said.\nWhile hiking the complete trail takes 10 days, those short on time can tackle it in bite-sized chunks, as I opted to do, beginning with the first of the route's six sections: the traverse of Umm Ejil. This leads to the spectacular dunes of Wadi Umm Ishrin, where the surrounding cliffs hide a trove of petroglyphs and Nabatean and Thamudic inscriptions. Scrambling over another craggy rise, the sandy expanse of the Khor al-Ajram basin spread to the south. After threading the gorgeous Abu Khashaba Canyon, we scaled Jebel Birda (1,574m) and stood atop its enormous rock arch. The views from Birda's ridge encompass the greatest of Wadi Rum's sandstone massifs to the north, west and south.\nFrom here the trail leads east, leaving behind the camps and the sands of Wadi Rum's classic landscape to enter the desolate Tablelands, among the route's loneliest sections. It then arches south along an ancient camel trail, passing old burial grounds, further time-worn inscriptions and a valley dotted with traces of long-forgotten caravans.\nJordan's highest peak is the route's next landmark, located just 1km from the Saudi border: Umm ad-Dami (1,854m). The clouds burst with colour as I scrambled the final stretch to its stony summit. Salman, my young Bedouin guide for this stretch, explained that the peak's name is linked to an old Bedouin code of justice and honour. Blood feuds, known as damm (\"blood\") have long been resolved by way of this unwritten law. In Bedouin strongholds like Wadi Rum, this code still applies to this day, with tribal sheikhs still tasked as traditional jurists alongside – or in lieu of – civil authorities.\nLooking west from the summit to the burnt-orange bluffs, I wondered if the name could perhaps have come from their rusty tinge at this hour. A welcome breeze picked up as I admired the succession of ridges, towering over enormous waves of immaculate sand. Just then, I felt my phone buzz: a message in Arabic welcomed me to Saudi Arabia.\nThe trail doesn't actually enter Saudi Arabia, but curves north-west into the Hejaz Hills before approaching the final summit of the trail: Jebel Rum (1,734m).

{"doc_id": 58, "question": "Who are the most prominent Bedouin community within the Wadi Rum Protected Area?", "answer": ["The Zalabieh"], "doc": "It traces the stunning, extraterrestrial landscape featured in films like Star Wars and Dune, while helping to preserve traditional Bedouin culture.\nMy Bedouin guide Abdallah led the way up and into the crags of Jebel Umm Ishrin (1,753m), the sheer, eastern wall of Jordan's most spectacular valley: Wadi Rum. Though it's considered one of the world's most breathtaking desert landscapes today, few outsiders had ever heard of Wadi Rum in 1917 when British archaeologist and writer TE Lawrence travelled through, describing this eastern wall as \"one massive rampart of redness\".\nForty-five years later, his journey inspired the film Lawrence of Arabia, which effectively introduced Wadi Rum to the outside world.\nLong before Lawrence, local Bedouin scrambled to dizzying heights on these cliffs, blazing vertiginous paths to needle the mountains' narrowest gaps, reaching their innermost fissures and skirting their dome-capped summits on the hunt for ibex.\nAs Abdallah and I followed in their footsteps, clambering up the cleft of Umm Ejil (also known as Rakhabat Canyon), the passage narrowed and rock walls popped with weathered niches and delicate natural columns, as if marking the approach to an ancient shrine. Panting, I dropped to a black sandstone bench to rest beside Abdallah. We were deep in the heart of Jebel Umm Ishrin, engulfed in its silence, until a human-like whistle suddenly broke the quiet. I craned my neck to scan the surrounding cliffs. Such high, hidden reaches have long been considered the hideouts of magical jinn (genies).\nAbdallah smiled: a starling, he explained. Their two-part whistle is a familiar sound in the surrounding Hisma plateau.\nOf the area's hundreds of miles of red-sand desert, the bulk of which stretches beyond the Saudi border, it's Jordan's fortuitous sliver that is by far the best known. It's this stretch, centred on the Unesco-inscribed Wadi Rum Protected Area, that a bewitched Lawrence described as \"magically haunted\" and \"vast and echoing and God-like\". In recent decades, this extraterrestrial terrain has served as the backdrop of numerous blockbuster films, including Prometheus (2012), The Martian (2015), Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) and Dune (2021 and 2024).\nIt was also here, after years of careful scouting by a group of Bedouin and British friends, that a brand-new long-distance hiking route was unveiled in February 2023: The Wadi Rum Trail. This 10-day, clockwise circuit twists 120km from Jebel Umm Ishrin, encompassing the best of Wadi Rum's dreamlike landscapes, venturing far beyond the well-trodden 4x4 paths and into the heart of the Protected Area. As one of the trail's co-creators, Ben Hoffler, explained, it's a rich amalgam of Bedouin trails: \"Among the pathways it links are walking tracks, shepherding tracks, camel tracks, hunting routes, smuggling routes [and] part of the old darb al-hajj (pilgrimage route) to Mecca.\"\nHoffler has spent more than a decade blazing mountain paths in the region, including Egypt's Sinai and Red Sea Mountain trails and the Bedouin Trail – a transcontinental 1,200km route linking Jordan to Upper Egypt. Still, for Hoffler, there's a distinct and enduring allure to Wadi Rum. \"The mountains tower up and soar up in a way that has a grandeur that I haven't seen in other parts of the Hisma plateau. [Wadi Rum] also cradles a Bedouin culture that remains in many ways more traditional than what you'll find in the Saudi Arabian parts of the Hisma… It has a special feeling.\"\nLike the ingenious Nabatean civilisation that built Petra many centuries before them, the Zalabieh (the most prominent Bedouin community within the Protected Area today) were drawn to Wadi Rum by the perennial springs that trickle at the base of Jebel Rum – the majestic massif that towers over the valley just opposite Jebel Umm Ishrin. Sprouting with wild mint thickets, the rock walls around the springs are adorned with ancient Thamudic and Greek inscriptions along with several distinctly Nabatean shrines.\nYet, until only a few generations ago, the Bedouin village located at the base of Jebel Rum was little more than a huddle of goat-hair tents. Thanks to government efforts since the 1930s, the majority of the Bedouin here (as elsewhere in Jordan) have now permanently settled, with SUVs effectively replacing camels and 4x4 tourism driving the local economy. Most such tours head south, following the valley along a virtual highway of tracks.\nBy contrast, the Wadi Rum Trail climbs east into the twisting bowels of the mountains, losing the crowds from the start. Ten days later, it ends where it began, with increasingly hair-raising abseils down the face of Jebel Rum landing you back at the springs.\nClimber and adventurer Tony Howard was first drawn to Wadi Rum in the 1980s and has since played a pivotal role in putting Wadi Rum on the tourism map. In exploring and publishing the region's first climbing routes, he struck up lasting friendships with Zalabieh members and was deeply impressed by their hospitality and knowledge of the steep terrain.\nAfter Howard and Hoffler hiked the Sinai Trail together in Egypt, the two began collaborating with Howard's friends in Wadi Rum – among them Zalabieh elders – to create a similar long-distance trail in Jordan.\nLike Hoffler's other projects in Egypt, the Wadi Rum Trail was designed with both hikers and locals in mind. Though tackling the trail on your own is permitted, the creators are convinced that the most rewarding experience is to be had in the company of Bedouin guides.\n\"The Wadi Rum Trail first and foremost pays homage to the Bedouin of Wadi Rum,\" said Howard. \"They know the area, its flora and fauna intimately from ancestral knowledge – and they are always good company and good fun!\"\nMore like this: • The King's Highway: The road that reveals Jordan's history • 373 miles of secret treasures • Jordan's beautiful, cursed landscape\n\"There are many hearts in this path,\" said one such Zalabieh elder, Sabbah Eid. \"[It's a] beautiful experience with nature and the life of the Bedouin, far from communication and modern life… it gives a special spirit to the place – complete calm.\" As Eid explained, much of the impetus for the trail's creation was to support the Bedouin community, connecting \"a new generation of young people to work on this path – instead of working with tours on cars\".\nHoffler believes that Bedouin-led efforts like the Wadi Rum Trail can help preserve the Bedouin's natural environment and cultural heritage. \"If history have shown us anything it's that the Bedouin known how to live sustainably in the wilderness,\" Hoffler said.\nWhile hiking the complete trail takes 10 days, those short on time can tackle it in bite-sized chunks, as I opted to do, beginning with the first of the route's six sections: the traverse of Umm Ejil. This leads to the spectacular dunes of Wadi Umm Ishrin, where the surrounding cliffs hide a trove of petroglyphs and Nabatean and Thamudic inscriptions. Scrambling over another craggy rise, the sandy expanse of the Khor al-Ajram basin spread to the south. After threading the gorgeous Abu Khashaba Canyon, we scaled Jebel Birda (1,574m) and stood atop its enormous rock arch. The views from Birda's ridge encompass the greatest of Wadi Rum's sandstone massifs to the north, west and south.\nFrom here the trail leads east, leaving behind the camps and the sands of Wadi Rum's classic landscape to enter the desolate Tablelands, among the route's loneliest sections. It then arches south along an ancient camel trail, passing old burial grounds, further time-worn inscriptions and a valley dotted with traces of long-forgotten caravans.\nJordan's highest peak is the route's next landmark, located just 1km from the Saudi border: Umm ad-Dami (1,854m). The clouds burst with colour as I scrambled the final stretch to its stony summit. Salman, my young Bedouin guide for this stretch, explained that the peak's name is linked to an old Bedouin code of justice and honour. Blood feuds, known as damm (\"blood\") have long been resolved by way of this unwritten law. In Bedouin strongholds like Wadi Rum, this code still applies to this day, with tribal sheikhs still tasked as traditional jurists alongside – or in lieu of – civil authorities.\nLooking west from the summit to the burnt-orange bluffs, I wondered if the name could perhaps have come from their rusty tinge at this hour. A welcome breeze picked up as I admired the succession of ridges, towering over enormous waves of immaculate sand. Just then, I felt my phone buzz: a message in Arabic welcomed me to Saudi Arabia.\nThe trail doesn't actually enter Saudi Arabia, but curves north-west into the Hejaz Hills before approaching the final summit of the trail: Jebel Rum (1,734m). For at least a century, the Bedouin have scaled Jebel Rum's summits, where rabbits and goats still flit through its wooded gullies. For hikers completing the entire trail, it's a jaw-dropping finish, involving ropes, harnesses and multipitch rappelling down the mountain's western face.  \nUpon leaving the village, I mentioned to a handful of guides my desire to return and complete the full circuit.

{"doc_id": 59, "question": "How many different types of bread does Sardinia have according to Bazzu?", "answer": ["More than 1,200 different types of bread"], "doc": "Simonetta Bazzu teaches tourists to make traditional Sardinian pasta, but her biggest dream is to help young Sardinians love their island and its traditions.\nThere I was, sitting on a plush white sofa in a centuries-old stone house in the abandoned, 400-year-old Sardinian village of Battista. The house was a traditional stazzu (a granite dwelling common to farmers and shepherds in this north-eastern part of the island), and despite having stood empty for more than 40 years, a careful restoration made it feel as though time had stood still. There was a large stone fireplace, the original wood-burning cooking hearth, original stone flooring and a sleeping platform. Only the flat-screen TV served as a jarring reminder that you can sit in the past while staring at the present.\nTo get here, I'd followed narrow, tortuous roads perched above cavernous green valleys; a dramatic juxtaposition from the quaint cafes and colourful buildings of downtown Olbia 20km north, or the turquoise beaches and yachts in Porto Cervo further along that same curvaceous route. I saw no people along the drive but had been forced to stop abruptly at one point as dozens of sheep flooded the road, bells clanging wildly.\n\"That's normal here,\" said my glamorous hostess Simonetta Bazzu, looking every inch a young, blonde Sophia Loren as she welcomed me into her home. Reassuring, but so far little about my experience with her felt normal. Especially not the fact that she owns 11 rough-hewn, uninhabited stazzus that make up the oldest part of Battista, where many of her ancestors – and her father – were born. \nThe village became abandoned more than four decades ago when the last of its inhabitants – her 100-year-old grandfather, Salvatore and 95-year-old grandmother, Angelina – lived out the last 10 years of their life in Olbia to be close to modern conveniences not available anywhere near Battista, such as doctors and markets.\nIn a stunning feat of imagination and ingenuity, Bazzu has turned this tiny ghost town into a Sardinian culinary educational centre and pasta school through her brand, Vittoria Arimani, which she launched in 2019. Thanks to the careful restoration work of Bazzu’s father, who owns a construction company, three of Battista's abandoned stazzus have been converted into modern showpieces befitting Architectural Digest – an old goat barn turned into a wine cellar, a one-room stazzu into a pasta and bread museum, and the two-room stazzu, where Bazzu's great-great-grandparents once lived, into a pasta-making kitchen complete with an outdoor wood-burning oven and patio that could double as an upscale restaurant garden. \nBazzu's noble goal: to teach Sardinia's younger generation how to make the bread and pasta their ancestors made – for free – so the traditions can live on.\nLucky tourists like me are secondary beneficiaries of that vision, as Bazzu finances her work through the paid experiences she offers every day, year-round, inviting guests from all over the world to roll pasta on her gorgeous handmade kitchen table. Between the more tourist-driven months of May and October, she offers two classes a day – a lavish lunch or dinner with fruit and vegetables from her garden, baked goods, homemade cheese and wine and more history than one would expect to find in a traditional cooking school. \nSitting on the patio for lunch that day, I could hear birds singing and a lone dog barking in the distance. There are just five neighbours in the area, making the sounds of the past feel much louder than anything in the present.\nThat most certainly included the food, which Bazzu presented to me as a sort of historical dinner theatre, offering the foundational ingredients from her island in each course. Rose petals were strewn across a tree trunk used as a serving platter, and wedges of crusty bread were spread with homemade lemon marmalade and dusted with a powder she made from dried orange peel.\nInto tiny golden porcelain cups, she poured coffee made from acorns she boiled, roasted and ground. It was burnt and nutty in the most delicious way, and she told me her grandmothers drank this, along with coffee made from chickpeas and barley. \n\"In times of famine, we used what the land could give,\" she said. \"And before there were airplanes, it wasn’t easy to bring sugar, coffee, tobacco or chocolate to Sardinia. My ancestors used honey, almonds, lemon, orange, semolina, barley and acorns.\"\nThe island's bounty is staggering. Bazzu told me that in Oliena alone – a village of just 7,000 people in Sardinia’s central-eastern Nuoro province – 37 different almond varieties have been discovered.\n\"In Sardinia, we have more than 1,200 different types of bread,\" she added, \"and more than 200 different types of pasta – including filindeu, a sacred pasta that not everyone can make.\"\nBazzu learned to make filindeu and other ancient foods from living in small villages on different parts of the island over the last decade, studying bread and pasta making with the older matriarchs. I poured myself more coffee as I watched her crush walnuts from her home garden with a brick she found in the dirt. Soon, the nuts were whirring in a blender, along with water and Pecorino cheese, to finally be poured onto a bowl of Maccarones de ferrittu – a pasta from the Barbagia region in the centre of Sardinia named for the iron knitting needles from which they were traditionally shaped. They looked like doughy cigarettes after we rolled them by hand on the table her father made from an old tree.\nAs I brought a glass of her homemade wine to my lips, I asked why she built all this, and she began to cry.\n\"I love my island, but life in Sardinia is very difficult,\" she said. \"We are a beautiful island, but we are in the middle of the sea. In the winter, we have just two flights a day, and the boat is very expensive, so if we have wind, we have no boat and no flights. We have many problems. When I cry it's because it’s hard.\"\n\"Too many young people go to other cities for work,\" she added. \"I wanted to change the situation in Sardinia and show our history to the whole world.\"\nHer mission to inspire young Sardinians to connect with their heritage while educating outsiders about the value of supporting its gastronomic economy was initially met with a lack of understanding. \nMore like this:• The battle over Italy's eclectic, handbuilt village• Italy's classic pasta e patate (pasta and potatoes) dish• The snubbed Italian town that's now winning awards\nAfter earning a law degree in Milan and managing her father's construction company for 14 years, she says it was difficult for her father to understand why she would choose to make pasta instead of continuing to work with him. \"For my father, to make pasta and cheese was to live, not for a hobby or occupation,\" she said.\nBecause of this, Bazzu started with no money or support, catering to tourists who spoke English, which she did not know how to speak at the time.\n\"It was very, very difficult,” she said. \"My parents didn't help me when I started. People asked, 'why do you choose this work? Why do you make pasta?' Slowly, people started to understand my work and my mission with younger people in Sardinia. \nTo get the word out about her mission, she often chats to strangers on the street. As we strolled through the alleys of downtown Olbia one afternoon, she stopped a man wearing a chef's jacket as he was entering his apartment. He was stunned when he learned he could train with Bazzu for free. It's her hope that this kind of enthusiasm creates a ripple effect that will imbue younger Sardinians with pride in their heritage. She also hopes they can build on it by putting their own stamp on things, as Bazzu does.\n\"I am younger and love Chanel and disco, but I love to make pasta and cheese,\" she said. \"I love my tradition, but I am modern. God chose me to show the world that Sardinians are also part of the younger tradition.\"\nAfter many years, she's finally been recognised for the impact her work has had on her fellow islanders. In 2022 she was asked to appear on Stanley Tucci’s show, Searching for Italy – where she pulled a bubbling tray of zuppa cuato – a traditional Galluran dish of thin, crisp Sardinian flatbread layered with lamb broth, local cheese and wild mintfrom her wood-fired oven – while donning stilettos and a low-cut green floral dress with a thigh high slit that might make the island's numerous centenarians (and her ancestors) blush.\nWhen Tucci remarked that it resembled lasagna, she referred to it as \"Sardinian lasagna\" that doubles as a \"hidden soup\" because the broth is absorbed, giving the dish a remarkably rich flavour. \nNow a de facto spokesperson for Sardinia's culinary riches on international television, she has also been featured regularly in Sardinian newspapers L’Unione Sarda and La Nuova Sardegna. And while inspiring future generations and catering to the many tourists who have come through her kitchen over the last five years, you'd think the success would have gone to her head. But that's not Bazzu's style. She's only got her grandmothers to impress, and knows that wherever they are, they'd be proud to see her carrying on their legacy. Especially in stilettos. \n\"This isn’t an easy job, but it’s my happiness,\" she said. \"I live today, like my grandmothers yesterday. I have gratitude for my land, and just want people to know the real Sardinia.\"\n-- \nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}
{"doc_id": 60, "question": "What is the name of the farm in Pomfret that became one of the most photographed places in the state?", "answer": ["Sleepy Hollow Farm"], "doc": "As hordes of photographers began descending on a small, rural community to capture its vibrant autumnal colours, local residents have been fighting back – and winning.\nTo enter the town of Pomfret, located in the US state of Vermont, is to be instantly struck by its bucolic beauty. From the north, Howe Hill Road winds downhill in a series of gentle curves, each sweep revealing verdant farm fields dotted with sheep, or swaths of forest in which the red and orange autumn leaves cling to boughs. At one home, a tree heavy with apples bends over a meticulously maintained stone wall, its slate top filled with decaying fruit. \nBut come early autumn, more than half of the cars driving through this 900-person town will sport out-of-state license plates, coming to abrupt stops on a road with a 45-mile-per-hour speed limit, blocking one of two lanes. The reason? To take a picture of a farm's silo against a backdrop of autumn leaves.\nWith a mere handful of businesses – a general mercantile store, an art centre with a gallery and a theatre and a few pick-your-own apple or pumpkin farms – Pomfret is generally a quiet, unassuming place. But in autumn as \"leaf-peepers\" from around the world descend on the region's rolling hills and fetching small towns to witness its kaleidoscopic foliage, that all changes.\nUntil recently, the number of leaf-peepers visiting Pomfret was more trickle than torrent. But ever since images of Sleepy Hollow Farm, a 115-acre private property set on a rustic road, began going viral on social media a few years ago, locals say things have gotten out of hand. A quick look on Instagram reveals thousands of images of the farm's winding earthen road lined by stately maple trees lit up in autumnal reds and jack-o-lantern oranges leading toward an elegant 1700s Cape Farmhouse on Cloudland Road. It's no wonder then, that this unlikely farm has become known as one of \"the most photographed places in the state\". \n\"It's a beautiful spot. It's too bad it's been ruined for everybody,\" said Deborah Goodwin, the exhibits coordinator at Pomfret's Artistree Community Arts Center. \"[For] the past couple years it's been out of control. Tour buses were just dumping... people out there.\"\nGoodwin says social media influencers would regularly climb over a gate plastered with \"No Trespassing\" signs, set up changing booths to accommodate their many costume swaps, get their \"city cars\" stuck on the narrow dirt road, and leave bodily waste by the roadside. \"It was bad,\" she recalled. \"The residents went to the [local government] and said, 'We can't have this anymore.'\" \nDuring the 2022 leaf-peeping season, law enforcement temporarily turned the road past Sleepy Hollow into a one-way thoroughfare. It wasn't enough to deter tourists from behaving badly. In 2023, local residents tried a different approach: crowdsourced funding.\nIn a plea on GoFundMe, a team of organisers wrote: \"[We have] experienced an unprecedented surge in Instagram and TikTok-fuelled tourist 'influencers'... [who] have damaged roads, had accidents, required towing out of ditches, trampled gardens, defecated on private property… and verbally assaulted residents.\" To date, the request has garnered 125 donations, and raised more than $22,058. \nAs a result, town officials voted to close the roads leading to the farm during the peak fall foliage season (23 September to 15 October) to non-residents, spurring the ire of travellers who had driven to the area in hopes of capturing a perfectly curated autumn photo. \n\"It's a hotel and amusement park,\" scoffed one Instagrammer with 153,000 followers. \"Bring all your friends and RVs.\" \nMost Pomfret residents stressed that they're not anti-tourist; they simply want people to treat their hometown with respect. Even more concerning than issues of private property, several mentioned, are safety concerns for the residents of Cloudland Road, as well as the tourists themselves.\nAccording to Windsor County Sheriff Ryan Palmer, \"This is not a road that's designed to have multiple vehicles on it. [In 2021 and 2022] there were lines of traffic parked up and down the roadway, and you couldn't get fire apparatus or an ambulance through. It was just overwhelming the infrastructure in the area.\" \nThings were different in the buzzy neighbouring town of Woodstock, where Cloudland Road ends. There, throngs of visitors dipped in and out of cute boutiques, their storefronts decorated with pots of chrysanthemums and warty winter squash. Outside Au Comptoir cocktail bar, patrons waiting for tables draped themselves over stone walls. On the town's sidewalks, people paused mid-step to capture scenic photographs of stately buildings erected by the Rockefellers. The town's eateries were jam-packed, too. At the Woodstock Inn & Resort – whose executive chef, Matthew McClure, is a seven-time James Beard Award semi-finalist – there was only enough room in the property's restaurants for those who were staying at the inn.    \nUnlike Pomfret, Woodstock is a town that thrives on tourism and is equipped to handle it. Lori Crowningshield, retail manager at The Vermont Flannel Co's flagship store on Elm Street, reported that 2023's shockingly rainy summer was \"really hard on everyone. We really, really need the tourists here.\"\nBut what's good for Woodstock isn't necessarily good for Pomfret. At a time when cities like Venice are so inundated with travellers that officials have imposed a tourist tax to visitors, and when trendy restaurants are banning influencers and their phones from dining, Pomfret is just one of many places around the world trying to curb overtourism and fight back against the hashtaggers – but it's come with a cost.\nAccording to Palmer, Pomfret's road closures aren't just time consuming for law enforcement to maintain; they're expensive too. Palmer guesses that Cloudland Road residents footed a bill upwards of $10,000 so officials could post road closure signs and enforce patrols – all of which inadvertently raised the town's profile as word got out. \nPalmer hopes that the Pomfret drama is a \"one-and-done\" deal. Residents have floated the idea of creating a reservation or ticketing system for visits to Sleepy Hollow to help manage the tourist rush in a more responsible way, but as far as he knows, that option isn't under serious consideration. In fact: feedback on the traffic pattern changes implemented in 2023 has been largely positive, leading to the Pomfret Selectboard's decision to implement similar road closures for the imminent 2024 foliage season.\n \"We enjoy having tourists here, it's a big part of the Vermont economy, and we want people to enjoy the natural beauty, visit the vendors and the shops, and drive around,\" he said. \"The big thing is having respect for people's homes and their property… Please come visit, just be respectful.\"\nThis is an updated article first published on 12 October 2023\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}
{"doc_id": 61, "question": "What is the name of the fashion district in Milan that Pierre Gasly often visits?", "answer": ["Quadrilatero della moda"], "doc": "F1 racer Pierre Gasly loves living in fashion-forward Milan. Here are his top weekend picks, from shopping in Quadrilatero della moda to walking his puppy in Parco Sempione.\nFor Pierre Gasly, a pilot for the BWT Alpine F1 team, everyday life is as fast-paced as a lap on the circuit.\n\"I've been doing Formula One for eight years now,\" says Gasly. \"I started racing when I was six; travelling the world since I was nine years old. I only know this life of being on the run all the time; being in airports and on planes.\"\nSo a great home base is especially important. That's why, in 2019, Gasly settled in Milan, Italy's stylish financial capital. \"I literally moved three months before winning the Italian Grand Prix,\" says Gasly. \"I didn't need to go to any airports, fly to any place. I just drove back home and then woke up on Monday morning in my bed as an F1 race winner. After all the emotions it really made me have this special attachment to the city itself and even to my apartment. I love this place.\"\nBut it's more than the sweet memory of victory that ties Gasly to edgy, contemporary Milan, a sprawling metropolis with splendid Gothic and Renaissance architecture and ancient Celtic roots. \"I'm a city guy,\" he says. \"I need to feel the action. Milan is a big city but not overcrowded, like Paris or London or New York. You can cross town in 20-25 minutes. Fashion is massive; I love fashion. You have two football teams; one amazing stadium. Whenever I feel like going out for dinner with my girlfriend you have so many different options and the food is very good quality; very pure, very healthy. It's just a combination of all my life pleasures in one place. I find it amazing to live here.\"\nIt certainly helps that Milan is also a huge Formula One city, due to its proximity to the Autodromo Nazionale Monza circuit, site of the Italian Grand Prix; a nine-minute train ride from Milano Centro in the medieval city of Monza. \"It's running in the people's DNA,\" says Gasly. \"Almost like a religion. [On race day], the atmosphere is very unique in Monza. When you have all these fans showing up, the grandstands are absolutely buzzing.\"\nHere are Gasly's favourite ways to experience a weekend in his home base of Milan.\nMilan can be overwhelming for first-time visitors, with a whopping 182sq km of museums, luxury boutiques and dazzling layers of architectural history from Etruscan ruins to contemporary Italian skyscrapers scattered throughout its 88 vibrant neighbourhoods. But when Gasly wants to show visitors his adopted hometown, he knows exactly where to go.\n\"I take them straight to the Duomo,\" he says. \"Though I've probably seen it 100 times, every time I still stand in front, amazed.\"\nThe Duomo di Milano cathedral, built in stages between 1386 and 1906, is the largest Gothic structure in Italy; topped by a bronze 18th-Century statue of the Madonnina (Virgin Mary) and surrounded by a sweeping piazza – a playground for street performers and pigeons. Adjacent to the piazza is the 19th-Century covered shopping gallery Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II; its ceiling a kaleidoscope of wrought iron and stained glass. Just 140m away is the historic department store Rinascente.\n\"I love architecture. I think the Duomo is a is a great example,\" says Gasly. \"[It's so] beautiful and massive. The Galleria, Rinascente, this whole area will take a big part of your afternoon. Obviously tourists go there, but even living here now for years I love going there and hanging out. Do a bit of shopping, stop for an aperitivo and just walk around. I find it really beautiful.\"\nGasly also brings friends to Navigli; a hip nightlife quarter cut through by two picturesque canals, dubbed the \"Venice of Milan\". \"[Navigli attracts] students who follow sports so it's not that easy for me to go there because I'll have people stopping me,\" he admits. \"But with a cap and sunglasses I love going there.

Some pretty cool shops as well.\"\nWebsite: https://www.duomomilano.it/Address: P.za del Duomo, 20122 Milano Phone: +39 02 361 691Instagram: @duomodimilano\nGasly is a self-professed lover of fashion, so it's no surprise that he loves living in Italy's fashion mecca. \"[The Milanesi] love their suits,\" says Gasly. \"The first time I came here, I was with my family, and I told them, 'How come all these people look so beautiful?' Every single woman or man was so well-dressed. They put lot of effort in making sure that they look great. And I quite like it because it creates a standard; you've got to look after yourself if you want to fit in.\"\nMilan is teeming with designer shops and indie boutiques – Gasly often comes upon new designers \"just walking my dog down streets I usually don't go down\". But the speedster finds himself most often in the Quadrilatero della moda – Milan's fashion district – so-called because it forms the junction between four of Milan's most prestigious shopping streets. \"It's pedestrian streets so you can go walking through there and you have every single brand that you can think of,\" says Gasly. \"You have everything… like Via Montenapoleone with all the big brands, which are pretty nice.\"\nMilan offers multitudes of culinary experiences, from classic Milanese dishes like osso buco (braised veal shank) and risotto alla Milanese (risotto with saffron) to top-notch sushi, a recent local craze. Gasly loves Milan's culinary scene: \"I'm a foodie,\" he proclaims. \"Even though it doesn't really match with my work; I gotta be very strict with nutrition. I'm a pasta guy, though. One place I love bringing people is Osteria da Fortunata.\"\nOsteria da Fortunata serves southern Italian fare in the Brera neighbourhood. There's always a long queue, but Gasly is undeterred: \"It's the best pasta. You see them literally making it from the streets through the window. It doesn't look fancy; it's quite a small place, it's just wooden tables, but the food is incredible; definitely worth the 30- to 40-minute queue. I'm an F1 driver and I'm happily doing the queue to get my pasta.\" His hack? \"There's another location in Moscova with less queue.\"\nGasly's go-to cheat meal is gnocchi alla Sorrentina; Sorrento-style gnocchi smothered with tomato sauce, basil and melted mozzarella cheese. \"If I go for a cheat meal with my girlfriend, we'll take one carbonara, one gnocchi alla Sorrentina and then we are done for the day.\"\nGasly also likes Beefbar, a swanky steakhouse on Corsa Venezia in the lavish Portrait Milano Hotel. \"I was there last night,\" he says. \"It's a really cool location.

But you do have some great spots.\"\nGasly's first choice for unwinding is the Bar at Ralph Lauren on the elegant boutique-lined Via della Spiga in the Quadrilatero della moda district. The bar and restaurant, opened in 2021, serves upscale bar food, wine by the glass and ample aperitivi in a space handsomely decorated in mahogany and cream. \"It has a nice garden,\" says Gasly. \"So, if you go shopping and you just want to stop for a drink, or refresh middle of the afternoon that's the best spot.\"\nIn Milan's city centre, Gasly also cites La Bullona as a prime spot for Saturday night dinner and drinks. \"La Bullona has a great atmosphere,\" he says of the tony seafood restaurant and nightclub carved out of a 1929 Liberty-style train station. \"They've got a DJ, nice food and it's great to go there before if you feel like going out.\" He adds: \"Usually my night ends after La Bullona and then my friends go crazy, longer hours.\"\nHis ultra-insider, super exclusive nightclub pick? \"Justme Milano,\" he says. \"The nights after Formula One; that's where they do the after party.\"\nWebsite: https://www.bullona.com/Address: Via Piero della Francesca, 64, 20154 MilanoPhone: +39 0233607600Instagram: @la_bullona\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

I'm an F1 driver and I'm happily doing the queue to get my pasta.\" His hack? \"There's another location in Moscova with less queue.\"\nGasly's go-to cheat meal is gnocchi alla Sorrentina; Sorrento-style gnocchi smothered with tomato sauce, basil and melted mozzarella cheese. \"If I go for a cheat meal with my girlfriend, we'll take one carbonara, one gnocchi alla Sorrentina and then we are done for the day.\"\nGasly also likes Beefbar, a swanky steakhouse on Corsa Venezia in the lavish Portrait Milano Hotel. \"I was there last night,\" he says. \"It's a really cool location. You have an inside court in an old building which they refurnished as a boutique hotel. It's maybe not authentic Italian, but it's a great location, great food.\"\nWebsite: https://www.osteriadafortunata.it/Address:Via della Moscova, 52, 20121 MilanoPhone: +39 0250033307Instagram: @osteria_da_fortunata_italia\nFor a romantic night out, Gasly recommends La Gioia, a refined seafood restaurant so intimate that it enforces a strict no photo policy. \"I absolutely love La Gioia,\" says Gasly. \"[It has] a wide variety of pasta which is incredible.\"\nLike Osteria da Fortunata, La Gioia is located in idyllic, tree-lined Brera, one of interior design-obsessed Gasly’s favourite neighbourhoods that's home to Palazzo Brera, a stunning 14th-Century Baroque building and former Jesuit school that also houses the illustrious Pinoteca fine art museum and prestigious Milanese cultural institutions including the Brera Academy. \"I love walking around in Brera because you find all these interior design shops with lightnings and furniture and all type of home furniture,\" he says.\nUpping the romance factor, Brera's pedestrian-friendly cobblestone streets and lush greenery give it a slightly bohemian feel, while its many cafes, galleries and fashionable boutiques make it feel like its own little world. \nWebsite: https://www.lagioiasanmarco.com/Address: Via S. Marco, 38, 20121 MilanoPhone: +39 3888839951Instagram: @lagioia_sanmarco\nWith his stringent training schedule, Gasly admits that he's not a huge expert on nightlife. \"Milan isn't massive for nightlife. But you do have some great spots.\"\nGasly's first choice for unwinding is the Bar at Ralph Lauren on the elegant boutique-lined Via della Spiga in the Quadrilatero della moda district. The bar and restaurant, opened in 2021, serves upscale bar food, wine by the glass and ample aperitivi in a space handsomely decorated in mahogany and cream. \"It has a nice garden,\" says Gasly. \"So, if you go shopping and you just want to stop for a drink, or refresh middle of the afternoon that's the best spot.\"\nIn Milan's city centre, Gasly also cites La Bullona as a prime spot for Saturday night dinner and drinks. \"La Bullona has a great atmosphere,\" he says of the tony seafood restaurant and nightclub carved out of a 1929 Liberty-style train station. \"They've got a DJ, nice food and it's great to go there before if you feel like going out.\" He adds: \"Usually my night ends after La Bullona and then my friends go crazy, longer hours.\"\nHis ultra-insider, super exclusive nightclub pick? \"Justme Milano,\" he says. \"The nights after Formula One; that's where they do the after party.\"\nWebsite: https://www.bullona.com/Address: Via Piero della Francesca, 64, 20154 MilanoPhone: +39 0233607600Instagram: @la_bullona\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}
{"doc_id": 62, "question": "What was the name of the hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico in 2017?", "answer": ["Hurricane Maria"], "doc": "As floods, storms and wildfires intensify around the world, these are a few key questions to ask when considering travelling to a destination recovering from a natural disaster.\nFrom raging wildfires to record-breaking storms, a swathe of natural disasters have wreaked havoc on communities around the world this summer. Experts believe that as the climate crisis intensifies, the intensity and frequency of these extreme floods, fires, hurricanes and tornadoes will only continue to increase.\n Many cities are already looking for ways to mitigate the impact of climate change-induced threats, from adding more green spaces to combat urban heatwaves to investing in flood prevention technology. As these threats become more common, travellers will have to better understand not only when it's safe to visit after a disaster, but when it's sensible. Here are some important questions visitors should ask themselves before booking a trip to a recovering destination.\nAfter Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, officials started welcoming visitors back to the island just three months after the storm. Though travellers were happy to return, many residents, who were still without power and running water, quickly found themselves resentful of tourists at a time when locals still lacked basic services.\n\"I think it [left] a bad taste in locals' mouths,\" explained Mikey Cordero, an activist and co-founder of the Defend Puerto Rico Media Collective. \"You're enjoying my island, you're enjoying my community, you're enjoying what the local people built… but at the end of the day, it doesn't trickle back down to us.\"\nWhile Cordero acknowledges that the situation wasn't so much the fault of the visitors themselves, he feels strongly that both government and guests should do a better job to ensure that their money actually goes towards helping the local community, especially after a disaster. This is a particularly sticky issue in the Caribbean where all-inclusive resorts and cruise ships make up much of the tourism landscape. Making a point to stay at locally run hotels, shop with local vendors and eat at locally owned restaurants can help in hard times by ensuring that your tourist dollars are going directly to the affected community rather than to large companies based elsewhere.\nAfter Hurricane Katrina tore through New Orleans in 2005, leaving almost 1,400 residents dead and countless homes demolished, a cottage industry of Katrina tours popped up around the city in the following weeks to show that devastation to visitors – a move that many locals found problematic. \"There were still boats up in trees and houses sitting on top of barges,\" recalls Jason Bradberry, who lived in the city both pre- and post-Katrina. \"It was insane.\"\nIn response to public outcry, city eventually banned tours of the Lower Ninth Ward, one of the areas most devastated by the storm. \"No one wants to be cleaning out the remnants of the home that they've owned for decades or that's been in their family for generations, and have a tour bus drive by,\" said Kelly Schultz, senior vice president of communications for the city's tourism bureau, New Orleans & Company, whose family also lost everything in the storm.\nHowever, the intense focus on the city after the storm did bring another type of tourist whose positive impact was deeply felt.\n\"Many of our visitors initially were what we call 'voluntourists', who came here because they wanted to help rebuild a church or school,\" Schultz explained. \"We had college kids come help clean out my family's house for their spring break. Like you could be on a beach… but you chose to come gut somebody's home, which is a physically and emotionally gruelling process.\"\nFor Schultz, tourism was also an important way to help keep the city's culture alive. She points to one of the campaigns the city ran when welcoming tourists back after the storm: \"Soul is Waterproof\", a nod to the importance of preserving the unique music, food and practices that make the city so special, as something that also helped to bolster residents' pride after the devastation.\nIt's important to keep in mind the devasting impact these events have on locals and to be respectful of the people still struggling to recover. Organisations like the Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity and local churches and other community organisations often offer volunteer opportunities for both locals and visitors alike in the wake of disasters, as they did during the flooding in Kentucky in 2022, Hurricane Ida in 2021 and during the rash of tornados that tore through the Midwestern US in 2023.\nIn 2023, wildfires burned through the island of Maui in Hawaii, leaving the historic community of Lāhainā particularly devastated. In response, the state's governor called for an evacuation of tourists as well as a temporary halt on incoming visitors, \"so that resources and attention could be focused on the residents who needed it the most at that time\", explained Ilihia Gionson, public affairs officer at the Hawaii Tourism Authority.\nThe moratorium on travel to the island lasted about a week before tourism was slowly phased back in. The key to success, however, was that the locals played a major role in the reopening. \"Our Department of Health did a rapid needs assessment,\" Gionson said. \"Just asking disaster survivors 'what is your most critical need right now?' More than a third of respondents listed either financial stability or housing stability or some combination of that. Understanding that… there were about 60,000 jobs powered by visitor spending, it was clear that we needed to recover travel demand to the island of Maui.\"\nOfficials also made sure that when visitors were allowed back on the island, they were respectful of those still struggling to restart their lives, by making devastated neighbourhoods off limits to tourists. Instead, visitors were encouraged to support the community in other ways, and though visitor numbers are still in recovery, many people rose to the challenge.\nThe clear communication and locals-first approach put forth by the island's leadership was reflected back by visitors. \"In Maui's hour of need, the outpouring of aloha from around the world… whether it was monetary donations or offers of expertise or just prayers and good wishes. It was really heartwarming to see,\" said Gionson.\nWhile Gionson acknowledges that there's no easy answer of when places should start welcoming visitors after a disaster, he feels there are some clear guidelines that both travellers and destinations should follow. Top of mind is honest and transparent communication about the impact of the disaster from officials and respectful behaviour to affected residents from visitors. But perhaps more important than that, is that everyone does their part to make sure that the reopening of tourism supports the community at large.\n\"Tourism is an important piece of any community's recovery post-disaster, but you cannot let the economic activity lead everything,\" he said. \"You have real people who experienced the real trauma, who have different needs for their recovery. Restoring the economic activity for an area is one factor to consider, but it cannot be the only factor.

{"doc_id": 64, "question": "What is the name of the river that Roger Deakin frequently swam in and wrote about in his book Waterlog?", "answer": ["The Waveney"], "doc": "Steeped in history, it played a central role in Roger Deakin's groundbreaking book Waterlog that kick-started Britain's wild swimming movement.\n\"The Waveney for me, as my local river, has always been a kind of escape route,\" the late naturalist and wild swimming enthusiast Roger Deakin once said in a BBC radio piece. \"It's a way into another world.\"\nThe Waveney is my local river, too. And as this year marks 25 years since Deakin's ground-breaking book Waterlog: A Swimmer's Journey Through Britain, which arguably launched Britain's wild swimming movement by embracing the outdoors, encouraging the \"right to swim\" and arguing that \"natural water has always held the magical power to cure\", I wanted to journey the length of this waterway most Brits haven’t heard of with a dip, kayak and pedal about to unearth its allure.\nDeakin lived for 26 years in a 16th-Century farmhouse in the village of Mellis, four miles south of the Waveney, where he would swim in its moat. His regular wild dip sparked the idea of 36 swim adventures in places across Britain. Breaststroke inspired pen stroke and his cult classic emerged. In his three dozen plunges for Waterlog, he took in the Isles of Scilly with a snorkel and submersions in ice-cold tarns in Wales. But the Waveney was his favourite river and he would return to it time and again, devoting much of the chapter Extinctions to the waterway.\nThe Waveney was a \"secret river\" he wrote, \"by turns lazy and agile, dashing over shallow beds of golden gravel, then suddenly quiet, dignified and deep… With its secret pools and occasional sandy beaches, the Waveney is full of swimming holes, diving stages improvised from wooden pallets, dangling ropes and upturned canoes pulled up on the bank.\"\nDeakin often biked to many of his wild swimming destinations. \"The quality of cycling is akin to swimming,\" he described in Waterlog. \"I enjoy the gliding, swooping motion of the bike as I enjoy the grace of swimming.\"\nDeakin canoed the Waveney, too. He produced a radio documentary for the BBC on paddling the river from its source at Redgrave and Lopham Fen via Hoxne to the Geldeston Locks in a vessel named Cigarette.\nThe Waveney meanders along 59 miles of the Norfolk-Suffolk border in East Anglia before slipping into the River Yare and nosediving to the sea at Great Yarmouth. Along its willow tree-shaded watery kinks are an award-winning vineyard, an award-winning cheese dairy, craft breweries and indie cafes. Otters, kingfishers, endangered lapwings and water voles call the river home.\nDrainage mills, which once emptied the marshes of water for crops and cattle, remain upright, like sentinels. In winter, an elusive mantle hovers over the gloam with ghost-white mills looming large; reeds stiffen with frost. In spring, pussy willow seed fluff settles on the river like the softest of snow. And in summer, birds chatter and hedges swell with wild blooms.\nThe Waveney marks the southern extent of the Broads National Park, but it's all quite under-the-radar and deliciously underdeveloped, with barely a road alongside. My partner and I cycled as close to the river as possible to trace its route and uncover its secrets. From Diss, a Norfolk market town (handy with its railway station), we cycled 104 miles across four days over gently undulating river valley to the sea, staying at B&Bs along the way.\nFive miles west of Diss, Hoxne is a quaint village home to extraordinary stories. Edmund the Martyr, the 9th-Century king of East Anglia, and England's original patron saint, hid from enemy soldiers under Goldbrook Bridge. His golden spurs, reflected in the water, betrayed his position and he was given up by a passing wedding party. At the St Edmund's Cross memorial nearby, which commemorates the site of his capture and beheading at an oak tree, a gardener told us: \"Wedding folk don't use that bridge even now. They go around.\"\nEdmund's story is somewhat eclipsed by that of the Hoxne discovery of 15,000 coins, the largest hoard of Roman gold and silver ever found in the UK.\nAfter a swift pint mulling treasure at the timbered Swan Inn, we pedalled down a lane fragrant with wild garlic to what is arguably the most beautiful mill house on the Waveney. Deakin thought so, too, as he mentions it as a highlight in his radio piece.\nJust south of the town of Harleston sits Shotford Bridge. Beneath, there's a popular swimming spot that's looked after by The River Waveney Trust. \"The [wild swimming] movement highlights that people do want to swim in rivers and the water quality should be good enough for everybody to swim,\" said trust director Martha Meek.\nAfter a swim in the cool river shaded by willow branches drooping into the water and glancing red dragonflies and damselflies in sapphire blue darting about, we refreshed at The Cap, a craft brew pub in Harleston, for a pint of Ampersand's Bidon pale ale and a summery Basil Blush with raspberry.\nWe then cycled to the village of Mendham, crossing the bridge spanning the river and water meadows in the early evening sun as cows munched the grass. We stayed at the pocket-friendly Sir Alfred Munnings Hotel. The pretty mill at Mendham (now a holiday let) straddling the river is the birthplace of Sir Alfred Munnings (1878-1959), known as England's finest painter of horses – some of whose early scenes depict life in the Waveney Valley.\nWe glimpsed more valley life the following morning: Wortwell village's large striking-white weatherboard watermill is first mentioned in the Domesday Book, William the Conqueror's land survey of England. And at Homersfield village, we soaked up the sun-dappled river scene from a small bridge. Built in 1869, it's the oldest concrete bridge in Britain and arcs a sluggish spot in the river. We swam here, too, in the water, drinking in the wildness and romance. Water voles plopped into the river, their loud splashes breaking the peace. Deakin himself had spotted water vole holes \"the size of tennis balls in the banks\" as he paddled in Cigarette.\nThe Waveney at Bungay balloons in an oxbow curl. (Hire a canoe at Outney Meadow Caravan Park to paddle the waters here, and perhaps see an otter.) In Waterlog, Deakin swims around a bend in the Waveney and encounters an otter \"sunning itself on a floating log near the reed-bed\". Bungay is an enigmatic place with indie shops and cafes (great lunches at Earsham Street) and a 12th-Century castle. Known for its association with a demonic Black Shuck hound (honoured with an annual festival), lace curtains twitched in 2023 when it was called the Satanist capital of Britain.\nEscaping any potential clutches of the legendary dog, we cycled north to Flint Vineyard. A glass of mineral-y, elderflower-y Bacchus Fumé primed us before we climbed Annis Hill for a glimpse of private Mettingham Castle. We revived on the smell and taste of Ethiopian coffee at Silo Café where beans roast in a soaring 1950s grain silo on the river at Wainford.\nThe caffeine powered us on to one of the Waveney's most enchanting scenes: the white weather-boarded Ellingham Mill that overlooks a river pool with drifting swans. From here, the rural Geldeston Road lured us east to another of the river's highlights – the Locks Inn – right on the water and known for its live music. Deakin ordered a pint here as he docked Cigarette at the locks.\nGeldeston's bigger neighbour, Beccles, sits high on a cliff above the Waveney, with its huge church commanding the town. At Northgate street, the curved lane is riven with alleys that slope down to the river. In bygone centuries, wherries (sail boats designed to navigate shallow water) plied up and down the river's navigable arm to Beccles transporting goods such as malt, corn and coal.\nMore like this: • The 5,000-year-old pathway that's Britain's oldest road • The US's little-known 'Ellis Island of the West' • The Mediterranean island where hikers stay for free\nAfter a night in the beamed 16th-Century Swan House, we organised a guided kayak tour to see more of the river via Hippersons Boat Yard. As our paddles chopped the silky water, our guide recounted stories of reed cutting; herring history; Norfolk and Suffolk rivalry; and the eel, carp and perch swimming beneath us.\nThe Waveney disappears into the marshes after Beccles. We didn't glimpse it again until beautiful Carlton Marshes Nature Reserve, 7.5 miles away.

{"doc_id": 64, "question": "How long is the Waveney river?", "answer": ["59 miles"], "doc": "Steeped in history, it played a central role in Roger Deakin's groundbreaking book Waterlog that kick-started Britain's wild swimming movement.\n\"The Waveney for me, as my local river, has always been a kind of escape route,\" the late naturalist and wild swimming enthusiast Roger Deakin once said in a BBC radio piece. \"It's a way into another world.\"\nThe Waveney is my local river, too. And as this year marks 25 years since Deakin's ground-breaking book Waterlog: A Swimmer's Journey Through Britain, which arguably launched Britain's wild swimming movement by embracing the outdoors, encouraging the \"right to swim\" and arguing that \"natural water has always held the magical power to cure\", I wanted to journey the length of this waterway most Brits haven’t heard of with a dip, kayak and pedal about to unearth its allure.\nDeakin lived for 26 years in a 16th-Century farmhouse in the village of Mellis, four miles south of the Waveney, where he would swim in its moat. His regular wild dip sparked the idea of 36 swim adventures in places across Britain. Breaststroke inspired pen stroke and his cult classic emerged. In his three dozen plunges for Waterlog, he took in the Isles of Scilly with a snorkel and submersions in ice-cold tarns in Wales. But the Waveney was his favourite river and he would return to it time and again, devoting much of the chapter Extinctions to the waterway.\nThe Waveney was a \"secret river\" he wrote, \"by turns lazy and agile, dashing over shallow beds of golden gravel, then suddenly quiet, dignified and deep… With its secret pools and occasional sandy beaches, the Waveney is full of swimming holes, diving stages improvised from wooden pallets, dangling ropes and upturned canoes pulled up on the bank.\"\nDeakin often biked to many of his wild swimming destinations. \"The quality of cycling is akin to swimming,\" he described in Waterlog. \"I enjoy the gliding, swooping motion of the bike as I enjoy the grace of swimming.\"\nDeakin canoed the Waveney, too. He produced a radio documentary for the BBC on paddling the river from its source at Redgrave and Lopham Fen via Hoxne to the Geldeston Locks in a vessel named Cigarette.\nThe Waveney meanders along 59 miles of the Norfolk-Suffolk border in East Anglia before slipping into the River Yare and nosediving to the sea at Great Yarmouth. Along its willow tree-shaded watery kinks are an award-winning vineyard, an award-winning cheese dairy, craft breweries and indie cafes. Otters, kingfishers, endangered lapwings and water voles call the river home.\nDrainage mills, which once emptied the marshes of water for crops and cattle, remain upright, like sentinels. In winter, an elusive mantle hovers over the gloam with ghost-white mills looming large; reeds stiffen with frost. In spring, pussy willow seed fluff settles on the river like the softest of snow. And in summer, birds chatter and hedges swell with wild blooms.\nThe Waveney marks the southern extent of the Broads National Park, but it's all quite under-the-radar and deliciously underdeveloped, with barely a road alongside. My partner and I cycled as close to the river as possible to trace its route and uncover its secrets. From Diss, a Norfolk market town (handy with its railway station), we cycled 104 miles across four days over gently undulating river valley to the sea, staying at B&Bs along the way.\nFive miles west of Diss, Hoxne is a quaint village home to extraordinary stories. Edmund the Martyr, the 9th-Century king of East Anglia, and England's original patron saint, hid from enemy soldiers under Goldbrook Bridge. His golden spurs, reflected in the water, betrayed his position and he was given up by a passing wedding party. At the St Edmund's Cross memorial nearby, which commemorates the site of his capture and beheading at an oak tree, a gardener told us: \"Wedding folk don't use that bridge even now. They go around.\"\nEdmund's story is somewhat eclipsed by that of the Hoxne discovery of 15,000 coins, the largest hoard of Roman gold and silver ever found in the UK.\nAfter a swift pint mulling treasure at the timbered Swan Inn, we pedalled down a lane fragrant with wild garlic to what is arguably the most beautiful mill house on the Waveney. Deakin thought so, too, as he mentions it as a highlight in his radio piece.\nJust south of the town of Harleston sits Shotford Bridge. Beneath, there's a popular swimming spot that's looked after by The River Waveney Trust. \"The [wild swimming] movement highlights that people do want to swim in rivers and the water quality should be good enough for everybody to swim,\" said trust director Martha Meek.\nAfter a swim in the cool river shaded by willow branches drooping into the water and glancing red dragonflies and damselflies in sapphire blue darting about, we refreshed at The Cap, a craft brew pub in Harleston, for a pint of Ampersand's Bidon pale ale and a summery Basil Blush with raspberry.\nWe then cycled to the village of Mendham, crossing the bridge spanning the river and water meadows in the early evening sun as cows munched the grass. We stayed at the pocket-friendly Sir Alfred Munnings Hotel. The pretty mill at Mendham (now a holiday let) straddling the river is the birthplace of Sir Alfred Munnings (1878-1959), known as England's finest painter of horses – some of whose early scenes depict life in the Waveney Valley.\nWe glimpsed more valley life the following morning: Wortwell village's large striking-white weatherboard watermill is first mentioned in the Domesday Book, William the Conqueror's land survey of England. And at Homersfield village, we soaked up the sun-dappled river scene from a small bridge. Built in 1869, it's the oldest concrete bridge in Britain and arcs a sluggish spot in the river. We swam here, too, in the water, drinking in the wildness and romance. Water voles plopped into the river, their loud splashes breaking the peace. Deakin himself had spotted water vole holes \"the size of tennis balls in the banks\" as he paddled in Cigarette.\nThe Waveney at Bungay balloons in an oxbow curl. (Hire a canoe at Outney Meadow Caravan Park to paddle the waters here, and perhaps see an otter.) In Waterlog, Deakin swims around a bend in the Waveney and encounters an otter \"sunning itself on a floating log near the reed-bed\". Bungay is an enigmatic place with indie shops and cafes (great lunches at Earsham Street) and a 12th-Century castle. Known for its association with a demonic Black Shuck hound (honoured with an annual festival), lace curtains twitched in 2023 when it was called the Satanist capital of Britain.\nEscaping any potential clutches of the legendary dog, we cycled north to Flint Vineyard. A glass of mineral-y, elderflower-y Bacchus Fumé primed us before we climbed Annis Hill for a glimpse of private Mettingham Castle. We revived on the smell and taste of Ethiopian coffee at Silo Café where beans roast in a soaring 1950s grain silo on the river at Wainford.\nThe caffeine powered us on to one of the Waveney's most enchanting scenes: the white weather-boarded Ellingham Mill that overlooks a river pool with drifting swans. From here, the rural Geldeston Road lured us east to another of the river's highlights – the Locks Inn – right on the water and known for its live music. Deakin ordered a pint here as he docked Cigarette at the locks.\nGeldeston's bigger neighbour, Beccles, sits high on a cliff above the Waveney, with its huge church commanding the town. At Northgate street, the curved lane is riven with alleys that slope down to the river. In bygone centuries, wherries (sail boats designed to navigate shallow water) plied up and down the river's navigable arm to Beccles transporting goods such as malt, corn and coal.\nMore like this: • The 5,000-year-old pathway that's Britain's oldest road • The US's little-known 'Ellis Island of the West' • The Mediterranean island where hikers stay for free\nAfter a night in the beamed 16th-Century Swan House, we organised a guided kayak tour to see more of the river via Hippersons Boat Yard. As our paddles chopped the silky water, our guide recounted stories of reed cutting; herring history; Norfolk and Suffolk rivalry; and the eel, carp and perch swimming beneath us.\nThe Waveney disappears into the marshes after Beccles. We didn't glimpse it again until beautiful Carlton Marshes Nature Reserve, 7.5 miles away.

{"doc_id": 65, "question": "At what age did Sloan Rinaldi start pursuing barbecue as a career?", "answer": ["50"], "doc": "Sloan Rinaldi became a BBQ master at 50 and made it to the top three in Season 3 of Netflix's Barbecue Showdown. Here are her top BBQ joints in her hometown of Houston.\nFor Sloan Rinaldi, a fourth-generation Houstonian pitmaster, Texas barbecue is serious business.\n\"I have a passion for it, for sure,\" says Rinaldi, who first pursued barbecue as a career at the age of 50. \"Yeah; passion, or you're not doing it!\"\nRinaldi rose swiftly in the Texas barbecue circuit, smashing barriers as a female pitmaster in a male-dominated field. This year, at age 60, her profile skyrocketed when she made it to the Top three in the latest season of Netflix's Barbecue Showdown, winning challenge after challenge with her perfectly executed craft barbecue recipes, and most importantly, representing her state and beloved hometown. \"[I'm] very proud of Houston!\" she says. \"It's dynamic, diverse, booming. It offers something for everyone, really.\"\nAnd Houston barbecue? \"Overall, there are two kinds of Texas BBQ,\" explains Rinaldi. \"Old-school barbecue and craft barbecue, meaning that everything is elevated… You're sourcing the best protein, all of the ingredients that go into your sides, everything handcrafted from scratch.\" \nHouston barbecue, specifically, draws hugely from the city's multicultural makeup. \"We consider Louisiana to be more of East Texas,\" says Rinaldi. \"They have a Creole cuisine that definitely is in our roots and our culture as well. So in Houston, it's going to be a fusion. Our barbecue scene has become very diverse with Asian influences – Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Egyptian, Iranian – you name it. Truly, we have 30 incredible craft barbecue joints right now that you can go to any day of the week, and you would not be disappointed.\"\nHere are the winners of Rinaldi's Houston Barbecue Showdown.\n\"Brisket is the king of all barbecue and Texas is best at brisket,\" proclaims Rinaldi.\nOf the nine \"primal cuts\" of meat used in barbecue, brisket – beef breast meat smoked until fall-apart-tender – is undeniably elite. And Rinaldi's favourite comes from Truth Barbecue, an upscale joint in Houston's historic Heights Boulevard.\n\"It's run by Leo [Botello IV],\" she says. \"He's a young pitmaster; one of the most consistently good pitmasters I've ever come across.\"\nTruth Barbecue began its life as what Rinaldi calls a \"complete hole in the wall, dive on the side of the road\" in the town of Brenham, roughly halfway between Houston and Austin. \"[Now he's] opened up a joint on Heights Boulevard, which is a major location. It's been there since 2021 and every day there's a line around the building.\" \nAnd how's that brisket? \"It's very beefy; very rich and succulent,\" she says. \"Fat content is essential in rendering a melt-in-your-mouth bite of brisket. The salt and pepper rub is spot on. It's not too much of anything.\nRinaldi's respect for Truth Barbecue doesn't end at brisket; she calls it Houston's \"best all-around joint\", and home to its best desserts. \n\"Turkey, ribs, house-made sausage,\" she says. \"They do boudin at times; a Cajun sausage. They do limited sides, but they are all stellar. And Leo's mom makes a three-layer cake. You can take it home and eat it for three days. My favourite is the carrot cake. The best cakes in Texas barbecue.\"\nWebsite: https://truthbbq.com/Address: 110 S Heights Blvd, Houston, TX 77007Phone: +1 832 835 0001Instagram: @truth_bbq\nMeat is the star at any barbecue; but Rinaldi points out, \"It's one thing to have incredible meat. It takes it to another level when you have really amazing sides.\" \nSide dishes – from fried okra to baked beans to blackened, blistered greens – are the quiet heroes of any Texan barbecue showdown, rounding out the flamboyantly rich meat flavours with forkfuls of pure comfort.\n\"That's where the finesse and technique and skill come into play,\" says Rinaldi. \"Obviously, being a woman, they don't expect you to be able to do barbecue, number one. I can smoke meat but then obviously I can do killer sides. And I love that. It gives me a little bit of an advantage.\"\nRinaldi loves the sides at Feges, a craft barbecue joint with locations in the underground level of the Greenway Plaza high rise – \"All the office workers go there\" – and the thriving Houston suburb of Spring Branch: \"Upscale, so very nice aesthetic inside. You have a great visual on the pits.\" \nFeges is helmed by Erin and Patrick Feges, a culinary academy-trained husband-and-wife duo. \"They're doing amazing things, and their side selection is deep,\" says Rinaldi. \"Usually, a barbecue joint will have four, maybe five side selections. They, at times, will have 20 plus, and they're all stellar, a lot of finesse. They're doing spiced Moroccan carrots. They also do brussels sprouts. They're doing sweet potatoes. They do a hog fat cornbread. They're very creative, and they're killing it on sides.\" \nWebsite: https://fegesbbq.comAddress: 8217 Long Point Rd, Houston, TX 77055Phone: +1 346 319 5339Instagram: @fegesbbq\n\"For ribs, I'm going to go with Grant Pinkerton,\" says Rinaldi. \"He has a lot of other good proteins and sides as well, but I think his ribs are really stellar.\"\n \nPinkerton's Texas Pit Barbecue in Greater Heights serves upscale craft barbecue – the meat is prepared gluten-free – and is famous for its excellent whole hog, which has landed the joint on the Travel Channel and Food Network.\n\"He has ribs he does two ways,\" says Rinaldi. \"This is the only place in Texas that'll give you an option if you want sauce on them or not, because everything is sauce on the side in Texas. So you can get a dry rib rub, or you can get it wet. And my preference is dry, but both of them are stellar so you can't go wrong, even if you were to get it wet with sauce on them. It's incredible. It's a great smoke, great flavour. The rub is simple and great technique, so killer. Consistently good ribs.\" \nWebsite: http://www.pinkertonsbarbecue.com/Address: 1504 Airline Dr, Houston, TX 77009Phone: +1 713 802 2000Instagram: @pinkertonsbbq\nHouston's barbecue scene is constantly evolving, and Rinaldi has her eyes on the best new kids on the block. \"I'm gonna shout these guys out big time; Bar-A BBQ,\" she says. \nBar-A-BBQ – the A stands for Abercrombie – is run by brothers Caleb and Cooper Abercrombie in the rural northerly Houston suburb of Montgomery. \"They're two brothers in their 20s that basically gave everything up and went all in on their barbecue joint and they're just killing it,\" says Rinaldi. \"I think they'll be on the top 10 list very soon in Texas.\"\nBar-A-BBQ serves a vast array of proteins, from turkey to mammoth-sized dino ribs as well as fully loaded platters, but Rinaldi is partial to their breakfasts. \"We cruised in, we had their breakfast, which was an incredible scratch-made brisket biscuit with brisket gravy,\" she says. \"Oh my god, it was amazing. We drove around the little town, just a quaint old small Texas town, and came back and decided to pick up lunch and dinner to go.\"\n\"They have so much passion,\" she says. \"I love it.\"\nWebsite: https://barabbq.com/Address: 21149 Eva St, Montgomery, TX 77356Phone: +1 936 548 5658Instagram: @bar_a_bbq\nAs exciting as the craft barbecue scene is, there would be no craft barbecue without old school Texas recipes and techniques. \"Old school barbecue is critical,\" says Rinaldi. \"That's what people have eaten for 100 years prior to craft barbecue becoming such a thing.\"\nRinaldi's own recipes – like her challenge-winning Texas Q Rodeo burger – owe much to the old guard, and when she wants something super traditional, she heads to Demeris Bar-B-Q. \"Their style is very old school. There's not a lot of finesse, but it's just quality, and it's solid, it's tender, it's juicy. They know their technique, and I really enjoy their barbecue,\" she says. \nWhat does Rinaldi get at Demeris? \"A brisket sandwich, oddly enough,\" she says. \"I rarely eat a brisket sandwich anywhere, right? But their brisket sandwich, I had it in the early '90s and it's the same today… There's very few places that have that now, where you went 20 years ago, and you go back now, and the food is the same.\"\nDemeris's brisket sandwich, like the rest of their dishes, is no frills. \"The technique on their brisket, it's not over the top,\" says Rinaldi. \"The flavour, the smoke, the tenderness, is just all perfect, and it tastes great on a sandwich. The bun is just a very traditional white bun. They griddle it just slightly, not too much, not too little. It's perfect. For me, the most important element of the bun is that it soaks up just the right amount of fat and grease, right? And then it all comes together.\" \nWebsite: https://demeris.com/Address: 1702 W Loop N Fwy Ste A, Houston, TX 77008Phone: +1 713 681 7204Instagram: @demerisbbq\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

{"doc_id": 67, "question": "What is the name of the dish that is unique to New Mexico and features green chiles?", "answer": ["Green Chile Cheeseburger (GCCB)"], "doc": "If New Mexico could have one state food, it would be the green chile cheeseburger, with each restaurant, diner and roadhouse cafe claiming to have the ultimate version.\nIt was a scorching early August day in New Mexico and I was heading south on the I-25, up and over rolling desert hills skirting the mighty Rio Grande River under a sky of endless blue. My destination was Hatch: a tiny village in the river’s valley, 70 miles north of the Mexican border, where a distinct aroma of sizzling fresh green chiles laces the air come harvest time, which had just begun.\nWhen I arrived and got out of the car, I was hit by a smoky scent that I soon traced to the nearby Grajeda Hatch Chile Market, one of many brightly painted chile purveyors dotting Franklin Street, the village’s main road. Here, I stood and watched for a while, transfixed, at the prized local ingredient tumbling in rotisserie-style roasters over roaring gas flames. A deafeningly loud and hot spectacle, necessary to scorch and loosen the chile skin to bring out the flavour before they're peeled, chopped and then roasted or turned into sauces. \nDubbed the chile capital of the world, Hatch was my final stop on a road trip to discover a fascinating dish unique to New Mexico that features this cherished fruit-and-spice in one: the green chile cheeseburger – or GCCB as it’s known locally. Not your regular burger, it comes served big and juicy, with cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle and, of course, a generous helping of green chiles, which I enjoyed roasted inside a \"world famous\" Hatch GCCB at Sparky’s Burgers and BBQ, Hatch’s roadside haven of Americana and kitsch where I escaped the searing heat after a mosey around town.\nHatch green chiles are renowned for their distinct flavour and heat, thanks to the unique terroir of the fertile Rio Grande River valley where they grow. Although this type of chile is grown throughout New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, California and Mexico, only those grown in Hatch can use the name. It’s a special ingredient celebrated every August at the Hatch Chile Festival, which has been running for more than 50 years and attracts more than 30,000 people.\nNew Mexico green chiles are defined by their long, thin shape, measure anywhere between five and 12 inches, and vary in spice level from mild to extremely hot. Fresh chiles are green, while dried chiles and dried chile powder are red. Chiles were first grown by Pueblo and Hispanic communities throughout Santa Fe de Nuevo México 400 years ago. So woven into the local psyche, they’re even used to illustrate car licence plates, and whether you prefer green or red is the state question.\nAnd here's where their story gets interesting. The GCCB is widely thought to have originated in another haven of Americana, The Owl Bar & Café, located 100 miles north of Hatch in the tiny New Mexico town of San Antonio. Its location is key to its existence: The Owl Bar & Café is just a 30-minute drive from the Trinity Testing Site at the White Sands Missile Range. This is where the world’s first atomic bomb was detonated on 16 July 1945 as part of the Manhattan Project led by Robert Oppenheimer, the lead scientist behind Christopher Nolan’s 2023 multi-Oscar-winning film.\n\"When they arrived in town from their secret laboratory at Los Alamos two hours north of here, they were masquerading as prospectors,\" explained Janice Argabright, fourth-generation owner of The Owl Bar & Café, as she told me about the Manhattan Project scientists. We were huddled in a leather-clad booth next to a polished mahogany bar that originally came from Conrad Hilton's father's saloon and rooming house, which was also located in San Antonio. \"[The Hilton hotel-chain founder] grew up here and our families were friends,\" she added.\nThe Owl Bar started with her great-grandfather in the late 1930s. \"He had a mercantile store with little cabins that he would rent out,\" she said. He also had the only payphone in town, so these \"prospectors\" would come and do their work and make calls. \"They rented their rooms and when they asked for something to drink and eat, we started serving food.\"\nThis was when Argabright's grandfather returned from the Navy. He needed money, so he opened a little bar in the mercantile store. \"He was the one who started cooking,\" she said, \"beginning with hamburgers, adding cheese and serving them with green chile on a separate plate.\"\nThe day the dishwasher didn't turn up for work changed the course of New Mexico's culinary history. \"With no clean plates left, my grandfather put the green chiles in the burger. So that's how we came up with the green chile cheeseburger dish we know today – and The Owl Bar & Café was born.\"\nThe improvised creation quickly became a favourite dish among the prospectors, who would come by regularly for cold beers and a green chile cheeseburger fix. \"They loved our burgers,\" said Argabright. \nRegarding the name, several untrue stories exist, but Argabright tells me it was chosen simply as a matter of cost. \"A travelling signwriter passing through town, who charged by the letter, offered to paint a name on our shop window. It was my father's friend and grandfather who chose 'owl' because it was short!\" I noticed the entire bar area festooned with owls of all shapes and sizes, amid other paraphernalia including first responder badges galore. There were also hundreds of dollar bills pinned to the walls with little messages. \"All gifts and mementos from appreciative customers,\" said Argabright. \"Every year we count up the dollars and donate them to charity.\" \nAt that moment my Owl Burger arrived on a small round blue plate. It looked classic, simple and unpretentious in a flour bun filled with an exceptionally juicy handmade beef patty, slathered in the family's famed (and secret) roasted green chile sauce. It was topped with American cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and finished with mayonnaise and a raw onion ring. It was so succulent I quickly devoured it.\n\"We've not changed the recipe at all since we started in 1945. We grind the meat so it's fresh and use a mix of chiles from Hatch, which somedays they're mild and others hot, so it's always a surprise,\" said Argabright, adding, \"and I think what sets us apart is the consistency of the burger.\" \nNowadays, across New Mexico, many restaurants, diners and roadhouse cafes claim to make the best GCCB, some of which feature on the New Mexico Green Chile Cheeseburger Trail. Launched in 2009 by culinary expert Cheryl Alters Jamison, the route takes in 66 stand-out restaurants, drive-ins, diners, dives, joints, cafes, roadside stands and even bowling alleys – including the Owl Bar & Café.\nI visited several more on my road trip along the trail, including the Buckhorn Tavern up the road from The Owl Bar, dating to 1944. Here, it's all about the Buckhorn Burger, a towering, photogenic GCCB that was a 2009 winner in American celebrity chef Bobby Flay's Throwdown, which used to air on Food Network. It consists of a handmade burger topped with American cheese and a healthy dollop of chopped, roasted chiles balanced carefully on top of pickle slices, a generous helping of shredded lettuce and a big slice of tomato – a savvy construction for extra height. It was delicious, succulent and subtly spicy, too.\nAnother unique stop was the sprawling Mineshaft Tavern in Madrid – pronounced “Mad-rid” – a creative community of about 80 homes on the picturesque Turquoise Trail National Scenic Byway. Its MadChile Burger, winner of the 2013 Green Chile Cheeseburger Smackdown in Santa Fe, was an elevated, gourmet affair. There was a choice of meat, including wagyu from nearby Lone Mountain Ranch, served in a shiny brioche bun with aged Cheddar, chipotle Dijon mayonnaise, two types of Hatch chiles (one tempura battered and deep fried, others roasted) served with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and a whole deep fried Hatch chile on the side.\nMore like this:• The 'Depression Burger' of Route 66• Roujiamo: China's 2,200-year-old 'burger'• The ‘Indian burger’ McDonald’s can’t master \nOwner Lori Lindsey is now – along with her MadChile Burger – somewhat of a local celebrity, having been featured on Tastemade's Worth the Hype TV show, and by British celebrity chef Paul Hollywood in his Paul Goes to Hollywood series. \"What you have here is the best GCCB in New Mexico,\" said Lindsey, smiling. \"It’s worthy of its own restaurant we sell so many. It's the most popular thing on the menu. It's hard for the chile suppliers to keep up with our demand.\"\nI also discovered the GCCB voted the best in New Mexico for five straight years at the New Mexico State Fair at Oso Grill in Capitan, a friendly one-street town that's famous as the resting place of Smokey the Bear, the face of the US Forest Service in the Wildfire Prevention Campaign. The inviting restaurant, set in an old bank building, was packed when I visited on a Tuesday night. \"It’s even busier at lunchtime,\" said owner Brian Cleckler, \"when the queue snakes around the corner.\"\nThis came as no surprise; their winning burger was unique for many reasons, not least because it arrived in a shiny brioche bun branded artistically with the ancient sun symbol that features on the New Mexico state flag.\n\"We also treat the burger like a steak,\" Cleckler said. \"We season it 24 hours in advance, then we cook it on a flat grill so that way it stays juicy. Then I use two types of green chiles; a hot one from Hatch for the sauce, and an Anaheim variety when those from Hatch are out of season, which we cut into strips, batter and deep fry. Then we have our homemade chipotle ranch dressing. I'm not a salad person so there's no lettuce or tomato. It's all about the green chile, it's the star of our burger.” \nNeedless to say, it's Cleckler's award-winning GCCB that tops the bill on the menu here, one of my favourite spots on the Green Chile Cheeseburger Trail. Tucking in, I wondered if the Manhattan Project scientists were salad people, and how they liked their green chiles. Tempura battered and deep fried or roasted, mild or spicy, perhaps? Who knows, but whatever their preferences, there's no doubt that the south-western food trend they loved that was created in the bar that opened to serve them is a testament to New Mexico's spicy food obsession – and now mine. \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

The GCCB is widely thought to have originated in another haven of Americana, The Owl Bar & Café, located 100 miles north of Hatch in the tiny New Mexico town of San Antonio. Its location is key to its existence: The Owl Bar & Café is just a 30-minute drive from the Trinity Testing Site at the White Sands Missile Range. This is where the world’s first atomic bomb was detonated on 16 July 1945 as part of the Manhattan Project led by Robert Oppenheimer, the lead scientist behind Christopher Nolan’s 2023 multi-Oscar-winning film.\n\"When they arrived in town from their secret laboratory at Los Alamos two hours north of here, they were masquerading as prospectors,\" explained Janice Argabright, fourth-generation owner of The Owl Bar & Café, as she told me about the Manhattan Project scientists. We were huddled in a leather-clad booth next to a polished mahogany bar that originally came from Conrad Hilton's father's saloon and rooming house, which was also located in San Antonio. \"[The Hilton hotel-chain founder] grew up here and our families were friends,\" she added.\nThe Owl Bar started with her great-grandfather in the late 1930s. \"He had a mercantile store with little cabins that he would rent out,\" she said. He also had the only payphone in town, so these \"prospectors\" would come and do their work and make calls. \"They rented their rooms and when they asked for something to drink and eat, we started serving food.\"\nThis was when Argabright's grandfather returned from the Navy. He needed money, so he opened a little bar in the mercantile store. \"He was the one who started cooking,\" she said, \"beginning with hamburgers, adding cheese and serving them with green chile on a separate plate.\"\nThe day the dishwasher didn't turn up for work changed the course of New Mexico's culinary history. \"With no clean plates left, my grandfather put the green chiles in the burger. So that's how we came up with the green chile cheeseburger dish we know today – and The Owl Bar & Café was born.\"\nThe improvised creation quickly became a favourite dish among the prospectors, who would come by regularly for cold beers and a green chile cheeseburger fix. \"They loved our burgers,\" said Argabright. \nRegarding the name, several untrue stories exist, but Argabright tells me it was chosen simply as a matter of cost. \"A travelling signwriter passing through town, who charged by the letter, offered to paint a name on our shop window. It was my father's friend and grandfather who chose 'owl' because it was short!\" I noticed the entire bar area festooned with owls of all shapes and sizes, amid other paraphernalia including first responder badges galore. There were also hundreds of dollar bills pinned to the walls with little messages. \"All gifts and mementos from appreciative customers,\" said Argabright. \"Every year we count up the dollars and donate them to charity.\" \nAt that moment my Owl Burger arrived on a small round blue plate. It looked classic, simple and unpretentious in a flour bun filled with an exceptionally juicy handmade beef patty, slathered in the family's famed (and secret) roasted green chile sauce. It was topped with American cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and finished with mayonnaise and a raw onion ring. It was so succulent I quickly devoured it.\n\"We've not changed the recipe at all since we started in 1945. We grind the meat so it's fresh and use a mix of chiles from Hatch, which somedays they're mild and others hot, so it's always a surprise,\" said Argabright, adding, \"and I think what sets us apart is the consistency of the burger.\" \nNowadays, across New Mexico, many restaurants, diners and roadhouse cafes claim to make the best GCCB, some of which feature on the New Mexico Green Chile Cheeseburger Trail. Launched in 2009 by culinary expert Cheryl Alters Jamison, the route takes in 66 stand-out restaurants, drive-ins, diners, dives, joints, cafes, roadside stands and even bowling alleys – including the Owl Bar & Café.\nI visited several more on my road trip along the trail, including the Buckhorn Tavern up the road from The Owl Bar, dating to 1944. Here, it's all about the Buckhorn Burger, a towering, photogenic GCCB that was a 2009 winner in American celebrity chef Bobby Flay's Throwdown, which used to air on Food Network. It consists of a handmade burger topped with American cheese and a healthy dollop of chopped, roasted chiles balanced carefully on top of pickle slices, a generous helping of shredded lettuce and a big slice of tomato – a savvy construction for extra height. It was delicious, succulent and subtly spicy, too.\nAnother unique stop was the sprawling Mineshaft Tavern in Madrid – pronounced “Mad-rid” – a creative community of about 80 homes on the picturesque Turquoise Trail National Scenic Byway. Its MadChile Burger, winner of the 2013 Green Chile Cheeseburger Smackdown in Santa Fe, was an elevated, gourmet affair. There was a choice of meat, including wagyu from nearby Lone Mountain Ranch, served in a shiny brioche bun with aged Cheddar, chipotle Dijon mayonnaise, two types of Hatch chiles (one tempura battered and deep fried, others roasted) served with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and a whole deep fried Hatch chile on the side.\nMore like this:• The 'Depression Burger' of Route 66• Roujiamo: China's 2,200-year-old 'burger'• The ‘Indian burger’ McDonald’s can’t master \nOwner Lori Lindsey is now – along with her MadChile Burger – somewhat of a local celebrity, having been featured on Tastemade's Worth the Hype TV show, and by British celebrity chef Paul Hollywood in his Paul Goes to Hollywood series. \"What you have here is the best GCCB in New Mexico,\" said Lindsey, smiling. \"It’s worthy of its own restaurant we sell so many. It's the most popular thing on the menu. It's hard for the chile suppliers to keep up with our demand.\"\nI also discovered the GCCB voted the best in New Mexico for five straight years at the New Mexico State Fair at Oso Grill in Capitan, a friendly one-street town that's famous as the resting place of Smokey the Bear, the face of the US Forest Service in the Wildfire Prevention Campaign. The inviting restaurant, set in an old bank building, was packed when I visited on a Tuesday night. \"It’s even busier at lunchtime,\" said owner Brian Cleckler, \"when the queue snakes around the corner.\"\nThis came as no surprise; their winning burger was unique for many reasons, not least because it arrived in a shiny brioche bun branded artistically with the ancient sun symbol that features on the New Mexico state flag.\n\"We also treat the burger like a steak,\" Cleckler said. \"We season it 24 hours in advance, then we cook it on a flat grill so that way it stays juicy. Then I use two types of green chiles; a hot one from Hatch for the sauce, and an Anaheim variety when those from Hatch are out of season, which we cut into strips, batter and deep fry. Then we have our homemade chipotle ranch dressing. I'm not a salad person so there's no lettuce or tomato. It's all about the green chile, it's the star of our burger.” \nNeedless to say, it's Cleckler's award-winning GCCB that tops the bill on the menu here, one of my favourite spots on the Green Chile Cheeseburger Trail. Tucking in, I wondered if the Manhattan Project scientists were salad people, and how they liked their green chiles. Tempura battered and deep fried or roasted, mild or spicy, perhaps? Who knows, but whatever their preferences, there's no doubt that the south-western food trend they loved that was created in the bar that opened to serve them is a testament to New Mexico's spicy food obsession – and now mine. \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

Last year, they lasted almost until January,\" said Morales. \"That's why we are working on implementing other energy sources, such as photovoltaics.\"\nThis innovative island wants to be the first Spanish destination to achieve net zero emissions. \"We're developing a climate action plan,\" Suárez told me. \"The aim is to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030, and achieve zero emissions by 2050.\"\nThese are big ambitions for such a small isle, but its achievements in sustainability are being recognised. Gorona del Viento has long been a role model for renewable energy projects around the globe, and in September this year, El Hierro will be presented with the Canary Islands Tourism award for Sustainable Tourism Destination, thanks in part to its long-standing environmental policies.\n\"We want to continue to be pioneers,\" said Suárez, \"not just in the Canary Islands but around the world.\"\nThat evening, I headed to Faro de Orchilla, a clifftop lighthouse ringed by rippling red-hued lava, and looked out onto the vast ocean. In the 2nd Century, Greek mathematician and astronomer Ptolemy put El Hierro on the map after declaring that the prime meridian was here at Orchilla, the westernmost point of the island that was – before Columbus set sail in 1492 – the limit of the known world. Longitude zero may have moved to Greenwich in 1884, but as I watched the setting sun streak the water pink and gold, I knew that El Hierro would never lose its wild, edge-of-the-world feel.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}
{"doc_id": 69, "question": "When did the three-star hierarchy of the Michelin Guide first appear?", "answer": ["1931"], "doc": "It's one of the highest culinary honours to be bestowed on a restaurant, but for decades, the process around how they're awarded has been shrouded in secrecy.\nWill-they-won't-they romance aside, the most interesting plot point of the new season of Emily in Paris may be chef Gabriel's dream of obtaining a coveted Michelin star at his restaurant, l'Esprit de Gigi.

The three-star hierarchy only surfaced in 1931, with one-starred establishments said to be worth a stop, two-starred a detour and three-starred a whole trip. The contemporary Guide is shrouded in mystery, with an undisclosed number of inspectors reviewing more than 40,000 restaurants in more than 30 countries. France alone counts 639 Michelin-starred restaurants, of which 75 have two stars, and just 30 have three.\nThe murky waters of what makes a restaurant worthy are clearer to Chef Maxime Bouttier after 15 years working in starred kitchens across France, as well as a stint Les 110 de Taillevant in London. \"I know how you can get a star,\" said the chef, who earned his first at Géosmine in March 2024. He cited \"codes\" like white tablecloths and soft piano music playing in the background, boxes some restaurateurs seek to tick. When Sedefdjian opened her Michelin-starred Baieta in Paris in 2018, she purposefully invested in beautiful tableware and stocked her wine cellar accordingly, even opening the restaurant in the space formerly occupied by Michelin-starred Itinéraires.\nSedefdjian's pursuit of stardom began far earlier, when she was just 14. She was attending culinary school and apprenticing at fine dining restaurant l'Aphrodite when it earned its first star. \"I saw what it was to have a chef who had been waiting for his star for years, to finally succeed,\" she recalled. \"It's something magical. I remember it as though it was yesterday, and it wasn't even mine.\"\nRestaurant insiders might have suspected Emily in Paris' season-four reveal of \"inspector\" Marianne as an imposter, seeing as when it comes to a Michelin review, chefs are always kept in the dark. \"We're never aware of the inspectors' visit,\" said Sedefdjian. \"If they introduce themselves, it's only after they've eaten. And often – very often – they never introduce themselves at all.\"\nThat said, a few clues are portrayed nearly to perfection in the 2015 film Burnt, when the manager conveys some odd behaviour to the chef: two customers, one ordering the tasting menu, the other à la carte, have ordered a half-bottle of wine and – crucially – placed a fork on the floor. “We used to say that they would put silverware on the ground to see if the waiter picked it up right away,” Sedefdjian said.\nFans of The Bear suspect the show of toying with the same trope in season three, when Richie notices a fork on the dining room floor. But there was no fork at Baieta; indeed, if the solo diner in his 40s hadn't introduced himself afterwards, Sedefdjian would have been none the wiser. \"You always think it's going to be an older person with a notebook.\"\nAfter the inspection, most learn about the status of their stars at a much-publicised ceremony. But for new restaurants, Sedefdjian said, \"Someone from the Guide calls you to let you know.\" As the ceremony loomed, however, \"I started saying to myself, 'This isn't possible. They're not going to call. They're never going to call.'\" And then, the day before the ceremony, an unlisted number popped up on her phone. \"My heart started racing,\" she said. \"It was someone from the Guide, calling to say, 'I wanted to let you know that your star is going to shine again.'\"\nBouttier, too, began his path to stardom at 14, when, upon sharing his desire to cook for a living, his mother pressed him to attend hotel school. \"It's a lot of theory, sitting on a chair,\" he said. \"If I wanted to be in the kitchen, it's because I was sick of being on a chair!\" They agreed on a compromise: that Bouttier seek an apprenticeship in a starred restaurant.\nFifteen years later, Bouttier opened Géosmine knowing he wanted a star – but on his own terms. \"We don't have tablecloths,\" he said. \"Our waiters are in Doc Martens. Our soundtrack is '80s rap. It's nothing like what we should have done to get a star.\" Nevertheless, Bouttier earned one less than a year after opening in April 2023.\nHis experience isn't an anomaly, according to trained chef, culinary instructor and gastronomy guide Allison Zinder. \"What I've noticed in the past 10 years or so is a much higher focus on the ingredients and techniques and what's on the plate than the plates themselves,\" she said. \"It's gotten much more simplified. It's less about the tablecloths.\"\nIn the trendy 11th arrondissement, Bouttier follows in the footsteps of neighbourhood pioneers like Bertrand Grébaut, whose Septime earned its first star in 2014 with waiters in sneakers and blue aprons, or Iñaki Aizpitarte, whose 2018 star at Le Chateaubriand came with nary a tablecloth to be found. Plates have evolved away from what Bouttier characterised as a \"demonstration of technicity\" where, often, \"you didn't even recognise the original ingredient\". Instead, contemporary Michelin-starred tables offer \"far more rustic plates with a lot of cuisine behind them\", he said. \"Lots of sauces, lots of preliminary preparations, but on the plate, the visual seems far simpler. Far more accessible.\"\nEarning a star can change things overnight for restaurateurs. L’Aphrodite closed temporarily to overhaul its galley-style kitchen into a grand cuisine, and Bouttier streamlined his offerings into a single prix-fixe menu. The most palpable changes, however, were beyond his control. \"We've got a starred clientele now, and that clientele is much more annoying,\" he said, citing guests horrified to learn they cannot bring \"dogs the size of cows\" to dinner. For Sedefdjian, the main change is in mindset: \"It brings a different sort of rigour.\"\nThe Bear and Burnt showcase the potential detriments of such an environment – on mental health and on lifestyle.\"You need to make a lot – a lot – of sacrifices,\" said Bouttier. He admitted his own meticulous nature has made him \"not easy to work with\".\n\"I'm only 32, but my management style is old-school,\" he said. \"If you start at 08:00, you're in the kitchen at 08:00. If you want to have a coffee and change, you get there at 20 to 08:00.”\nThe pressure is only magnified by Bouttier's next goal: a second star. To get there, he believes he'll need to hire more staff and renovate his kitchen. He'll reduce the number of covers from 30 to 22, which means a price hike. But it'll be worth it.\nMore like this: • The ingenious story behind Michelin stars • The future of food according to Massimo Bottura • Paris's most authentic and delicious bistros\n\"All of the places where I had fun as I was dining, in my life, were two-starred places,\" he said, noting that as a chef, two stars leaves you room to grow. \"If you have three stars,\" he said, \"you can lose them all.\"\nThe counterpoint to the joy of earning a Michelin star is the pain of losing one.

{"doc_id": 70, "question": "What year did Robert Doornbos make Amsterdam his home?", "answer": ["2018"], "doc": "Former Formula 1 and IndyCar driver Robert Doornbos has called Amsterdam home since 2018. This is the Dutch speedster's guide to enjoying the Dutch capital, during F1 and beyond.\nBoasting world-famous museums, nightlife to satisfy any urge and a unique cityscape crisscrossed by 165 canals, Amsterdam truly has something for everyone. That's why, after 10 years touring the world as a Formula Three, Formula 1, Sports Car, A1 and IndyCar Series racing driver, Rotterdam-born Robert Doornbos made the city his home in 2018.\nIn 2021, Doornbos was present at the first Dutch Grand Prix in 36 years. Held at the Zandvoort track, more than 40km west of Amsterdam, the circuit is next to the beach, which only helps to increase the party atmosphere.\n\"You won't believe your eyes when you get to the beach at Zandvoort on race weekend,\" says Doornbos. \"The Dutch are so passionate about Formula 1. The party is on! The promoters even won an award [in 2023] because of how they entertained the people.\"\nOf course, it helps that the reigning Formula 1 world champion, Max Verstappen, competes for the Netherlands, though he was born in Belgium. \"Formula 1 exploded [here] thanks to Max. Especially in 2021,\" says Doornbos, who was working as a live analyst at the 2021 Abu Dhabi race for Ziggo Sport when Verstappen beat Lewis Hamilton for his first title. \"We had six million viewers for the final race,\" he adds. \"I was awake for three days after celebrating. When I got home, I couldn't even walk down the street. It just exploded in popularity.\"\nOf course, there are plenty of other things to experience in Amsterdam besides the Grand Prix. \"It's such a great place to live,\" says Doornbos. \"There is so much history. There are great bars and restaurants that have new concepts. Plus, there are so many different ways to keep healthy.\"\nHere are Doornbos' recommendations for enjoying the Dutch capital.\nAt just 165sq km, Amsterdam is considered tiny compared to other European capitals. But that just makes getting around infinitely easier – especially since Amsterdam is one of the world's most bike-friendly cities, with nearly 402km worth of bike paths that take you straight to its main attractions.\n\"You just need to take a bike and go through the city,\" insists Doornbos. \"You can cycle along the canals, over the bridges, take in all of the architecture and beautiful houses.\" Doornbos especially recommends cycling through the historic De 9 Straatjes (Nine Streets) – a picturesque neighbourhood made up of nine intersecting lanes and four canals – and the trendy Jordaan district, both of which teem with bars, cafes, shops and galleries along their flower-lined streets.\nDoornbos loves to take visitors on boat rides down Amsterdam's canals, in particular the picturesque Prinsengracht, which loops around Amsterdam's city centre, and the beautiful Brouwersgracht at the northern border of the Jordaan, flowing past 16th and 17th-Century buildings and bridges. \"That way they can see everything,\" he says. \"Whether it's the Red Light District or people smoking in coffee shops, you get a real sense of the city, its history and how much fun it is.\"\nWebsite: https://de9straatjes.nl/\nAmsterdam's obsession with cycling runs so deep that there's even a cycling path through the Rijksmuseum, the national museum of the Netherlands telling the story of 800 years of Dutch history from 1200 to the present. \"You can actually cycle through our biggest museum,\" boasts Doornbos. \nThe cycle path takes you through the centre of the museum, past arches and huge windows on either side, leading to its garden. Once parked, you can go inside to see masterpieces from famous Dutch painters like Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Johannes Vermeer and more than 8,000 works of art. \"If you like paintings, we have a lot of famous Dutch painters,\" says Doornbos. \"Plus, it's in the centre, so you're not far from a nice bar, coffee shop or restaurant.\"\nDoornbos also recommends the Anne Frank House. Though there's \"always a long queue\" to see the museum dedicated to where the teenager was captured by Nazis before she died in a concentration camp, he calls it a \"special\" place to visit.\nWebsite: https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/enAddress: Museumstraat 1, 1071 XX Amsterdam, NetherlandsPhone: +31 20 674 7000Instagram: @rijksmuseum\nIf you're looking to sleep under the same roof as the rich and famous when they visit Amsterdam, then Doornbos highlights the opulent Conservatorium Hotel. \"This is where all of the famous artists stay when they have their concerts,\" says Doornbos. \"There are always people outside cheering and screaming. It's where Max Verstappen stays when he's racing, where Lewis Hamilton stays when he's in the city. It's a very famous hotel.\" Located in the heart of the Museum Quarter, the lavish 19th-Century structure houses 129 handsome, contemporary rooms as well as luxury shops, award-winning restaurants and a holistic spa. \nWhen it comes to a neighbourhood base, Doornbos believes that the elegant Oud Zuid (Old South) quarter is the perfect place to feel like an Amsterdammer. \"That's the nicest and most expensive area,\" he says. \"It's still very close to the main city. You can cross the park, go to great restaurants.\" The area, developed in the 19th Century, is now also full of boutique stores, galleries, museums — including the Van Gogh Museum – with Vondelpark, Beatrixpark and Sarphatipark all within walking distance.\nWebsite: https://www.conservatoriumhotel.com/Address: Paulus Potterstraat 50, 1071 DB Amsterdam, NetherlandsPhone: +31 20 570 0000Instagram:@conservatoriumhotel\nThe Netherlands might not be renowned for its culinary delicacies, but Doornbos insists that there are a few dishes people should try after a day of cycling or to provide fuel for the nightlife ahead.\nOne such treat is bitterballen (savoury meat stew croquettes served with mustard that go perfectly with beer). Doornbos also recommends trying other traditional Dutch dishes like \"Dutch meatballs, stamppot (mashed potatoes garnished with sausages), plus there's good old stroopwafel (thin waffle cookies) and warm apple pie with whipped cream.\"\nFor a meal out on the town, Doornbos likes heading to Oud Zuid and the city centre, where some of the city's best restaurants are located, like Brasserie Van Dam; a French-style brasserie on tony Cornelis Schuytstraat street. His pick for Italian food is the upscale cafe-restaurant Ferilli's, while he suggests that those looking to splash some cash visit The Duchess in the W Hotel; an opulent den serving Mediterranean-inspired seafood dishes accompanied by an extensive wine list.\nWebsite: https://www.vandambrasserie.nAddress: Cornelis Schuytstraat 8-10, 1071 JH Amsterdam, NetherlandsPhone: +31 20 670 6570Instagram: @brasserievandam\nIf you need to nurse a hangover, recharge your batteries or simply people-watch, then Amsterdam's most popular outdoor space is Vondelpark. It's named after 17th-Century playwright and poet Joost van den Vondel, and today, more than 12 million people a year take in its beautiful lawns, ponds, bridges and cafes. \"It's like a small Central Park in the middle of Amsterdam. There are people running, cycling, sitting on benches,\" says Doornbos. If you hear squawking, that would be the thriving colony of wild green parakeets that has inhabited the park and the city beyond since the late 1970s. \nBut Doornbos says that visitors during the Dutch Grand Prix should prioritise heading to Zandvoort Beach; a lively 9km stretch of sand, just a half-hour's train ride from the capital. \"It's so close and there will be parties through the night,\" says Doornbos. \"Everyone is so friendly. Plus, I'll be there!\"\nWebsite: https://www.amsterdam.net/en/things-to-do-amsterdam/vondelpark/Address: 1071 AA Amsterdam NetherlandsInstagram: @vondelpark_amsterdam\nSecond to its canals, Amsterdam is perhaps most famous for its nightlife. If you're after a high quantity of options in close proximity, the De Wallen Red Light District, splendid Rembrandtplein plaza and buzzy Leidseplein square are packed with bars and clubs. \nIn recent years, Amsterdam's \"vibe has become more international\", says Doornbos, citing spots in De 9 Straatjes like the steakhouse, bar and lounge Mr Porter found next door to the exclusive Soho House Amsterdam members club and hotel. But while these \"high-end places have great views of the city on their rooftop bars, it's like being in any other big city,\" he says. Not that he's complaining, as it provides an opportunity \"to meet a lot of friendly and international people\".\nIf you're after a more local experience, Doornbos suggests Café Nol in the Jordaan. With its mirrored walls, chandeliers, red carpet and curtains, \"Café Nol is like \"going back in time\", Doornbos says, adding, \"You don't spend hundreds or thousands of euros there like in other places, but you'll have the time of your life.\" \nWebsite: https://cafenol.amsterdam/Address: Westerstraat 109, 1015 LX Amsterdam, NetherlandsPhone: +31 20 624 5380Instagram: @cafenolamsterdam\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

But that just makes getting around infinitely easier – especially since Amsterdam is one of the world's most bike-friendly cities, with nearly 402km worth of bike paths that take you straight to its main attractions.\n\"You just need to take a bike and go through the city,\" insists Doornbos. \"You can cycle along the canals, over the bridges, take in all of the architecture and beautiful houses.\" Doornbos especially recommends cycling through the historic De 9 Straatjes (Nine Streets) – a picturesque neighbourhood made up of nine intersecting lanes and four canals – and the trendy Jordaan district, both of which teem with bars, cafes, shops and galleries along their flower-lined streets.\nDoornbos loves to take visitors on boat rides down Amsterdam's canals, in particular the picturesque Prinsengracht, which loops around Amsterdam's city centre, and the beautiful Brouwersgracht at the northern border of the Jordaan, flowing past 16th and 17th-Century buildings and bridges. \"That way they can see everything,\" he says. \"Whether it's the Red Light District or people smoking in coffee shops, you get a real sense of the city, its history and how much fun it is.\"\nWebsite: https://de9straatjes.nl/\nAmsterdam's obsession with cycling runs so deep that there's even a cycling path through the Rijksmuseum, the national museum of the Netherlands telling the story of 800 years of Dutch history from 1200 to the present. \"You can actually cycle through our biggest museum,\" boasts Doornbos. \nThe cycle path takes you through the centre of the museum, past arches and huge windows on either side, leading to its garden.

{"doc_id": 70, "question": "What is the name of the hotel where Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton stay when they are in Amsterdam?", "answer": ["Conservatorium Hotel"], "doc": "Former Formula 1 and IndyCar driver Robert Doornbos has called Amsterdam home since 2018. This is the Dutch speedster's guide to enjoying the Dutch capital, during F1 and beyond.\nBoasting world-famous museums, nightlife to satisfy any urge and a unique cityscape crisscrossed by 165 canals, Amsterdam truly has something for everyone. That's why, after 10 years touring the world as a Formula Three, Formula 1, Sports Car, A1 and IndyCar Series racing driver, Rotterdam-born Robert Doornbos made the city his home in 2018.\nIn 2021, Doornbos was present at the first Dutch Grand Prix in 36 years. Held at the Zandvoort track, more than 40km west of Amsterdam, the circuit is next to the beach, which only helps to increase the party atmosphere.\n\"You won't believe your eyes when you get to the beach at Zandvoort on race weekend,\" says Doornbos. \"The Dutch are so passionate about Formula 1. The party is on! The promoters even won an award [in 2023] because of how they entertained the people.\"\nOf course, it helps that the reigning Formula 1 world champion, Max Verstappen, competes for the Netherlands, though he was born in Belgium. \"Formula 1 exploded [here] thanks to Max. Especially in 2021,\" says Doornbos, who was working as a live analyst at the 2021 Abu Dhabi race for Ziggo Sport when Verstappen beat Lewis Hamilton for his first title. \"We had six million viewers for the final race,\" he adds. \"I was awake for three days after celebrating.

{"doc_id": 71, "question": "What is the size of Thwaites Glacier compared to?", "answer": ["Britain"], "doc": "In her latest book, The Quickening, the Pulitzer Prize finalist embarked on an epic odyssey to one of the most important – and least-explored – places in the world.\nIn 2019, 57 scientists and crew embarked on a 54-day journey to the farthest reaches of Antarctica. Their mission: Thwaites Glacier, a rapidly crumbling block of ice the size of Britain melting so fast it's known as the world's \"doomsday glacier\". \nThwaites is currently disappearing eight times as fast as it was in the 1990s, dumping 80 billion tonnes of ice into the ocean every year and accounting for 4% of the planet's annual sea level rise. Because of its colossal size and alarming collapse, this remote ice cap is not only considered one of the scariest places on Earth, but also one of the most important: the frozen ground zero in the global fight against climate change. Were Thwaites to completely melt, it could raise sea levels by 10ft or more, triggering \"spine-chilling\" global implications.\nBut a new study published this week suggests that the the so-called doomsday glacier may not be disappearing as quickly as had once been feared – though it is still rapidly vanishing. Instead of the glacier's ice cliffs soon collapsing into the ocean like a row of dominoes, the new study offers a somewhat more hopeful – if still dire – timeline of its disappearance. \"What we are seeing with Thwaites Glacier right now is a disaster in slow motion,\" polar scientist Mathieu Morlighem, who led the study, told The Conversation. \nOne of the people who participated in the once-in-a-lifetime journey to Thwaites in 2019 was Elizabeth Rush, whose vivid, poetic book about climate change, Rising, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Rush's latest book, The Quickening, chronicles this historic voyage to Thwaites' calving edge – a frigid, far-flung place never-before visited by humans.\nRush sat down with BBC Travel to discuss her Antarctic odyssey, how it changed her perception of the world and the ethics around travelling to some of the Earth's most fragile ecosystems.\nWhere is Thwaites glacier and how did you first hear about this expedition? \nThwaites Glacier is this really enigmatic place in Antarctica. It's in the far reaches of the Amundsen Sea. It was a four-day journey to the nearest research base. When I signed up to be part of this mission, my programme officer said to me, \"You know, it's easier for us to get help to folks working on the space station than it is just to get help to you guys if you have trouble.\" There's concern that Thwaites is entering a rapid period of collapse, but the reality is that no one had ever been to [its calving edge]. \nI applied to be part of the mission through the Antarctic Artists & Writers Program. They send usually two writers or artists per year to Antarctica, and I put together a 60-page application. There was a paragraph-long footnote to my application that was like: \"I write about sea level rise. I want to go to these different places in Antarctica and see the sort of sea level rise firsthand.\" I was very lucky I was given the last berth on this ice-breaking vessel. \nWhat kind of global effects would it have if sea levels were to rise 10ft or more? \nWell, the speed with which it happens makes a tremendous difference. So, 10ft over two centuries is really different than 10ft over 40 years. The concern is really what do human beings do about it? \nI'm a huge proponent of managed retreat, which is having a government entity intervene in low-lying areas and essentially purchase flood-prone homes for pre-flooding value, giving the folks who live there the opportunity to take that money and move up and in with it. \nNew York City has already done some managed retreat on Staten Island. The state intervened and they purchased and demolished over 500 homes on Staten Island. Eighty percent of those residents were able to take the money that they were given for their home and move elsewhere on Staten Island. We sometimes think that managed retreat is like fracturing communities, and that's not necessarily how it plays out. \nSo, sea level rise is not catastrophic if we prepare for it – and that's a big if.\nWhy do you think that you were one of the people chosen to be part of this expedition? \nIn the application, I wrote about how I would write a book that would have my narration as the main thrust but would include the voices of scientists and crew working in these places. The goal was to build a kind of polyphonic chorus to subtly shift who we think of as the narrator of Antarctic stories. \nThe first person to see Antarctica saw it, like, 200 years ago, and in this very short window of time, we've told a very narrow story about Antarctica – one that has a lot to do with human conquest and human beings overcoming incredible odds to do the unthinkable. Often those human beings are white men from the global north. All the stories about Antarctica sort of sound the same. I wanted to create a story about Antarctica that was much more democratic. From the get-go, I knew I was going to interview the cooks, the engineers, the Antarctic support staff on board. I think that that played a significant role in getting the application selected because, it was like, I'm going to talk about the science, but I'm going to do it in a way that challenges some of the dominant narratives we tell about Antarctica. \nAre there any stories that stuck with you about how this epic voyage changed the way travellers not normally included in the Antarctica narrative see the world? \nI remember talking to a guy named Jack who was a cook on the vessel. He's from New Orleans, and he signed up to be a cook on this expedition to help better take care of his grandfather financially. His grandfather died a couple weeks before we were to set sail and Jack still came. He had never been on a plane. He went on three different flights to get from New Orleans to Punta Arenas, [Chile], where we set sail. He'd never been on a ship. He'd never seen penguins. And even coming from New Orleans, he had never thought super-seriously about sea level rise. This whole experience was full of firsts for him. \nHaving the time to ponder the future of climate change can be a thing that folks do who are not trying to put food on the table every single day. But when he saw Thwaites, I remember him being like, 'Oh, I get it.' The glacier itself, when we arrived, it looked like arriving at The Wall in Game of Thrones. It was so big. It took us three weeks to get there. You feel like you're as far away from human beings as you possibly can be. And to imagine that our actions so far away are literally causing this epic wall to fall apart, it gives you goosebumps.\nThere's an ongoing debate about the kinds of places we should and shouldn't visit on Earth. One thought is to leave these hard-to-reach, fragile ecosystems alone. Another view is that witnessing their fragility up close leads people to care more deeply about them. What places, if any, do you think we shouldn't visit? \nIt's a great question, and I can only answer it from a really personal level. When we crossed back over the Southern Ocean, I knew I would never go back [to Antarctica]. I knew that my going was a one-time thing and that it made sense in the context of me coming back and working for five years to write a book about the expedition. Without that deeper meaning or impulse behind the trip, I wouldn't feel right making it. \nI can say strongly that in the context of casual tourism, I don't think we should go to Antarctica. I don't think that cruise ships should go there. I don't think that casual tourism to these places that feel \"untouched\" or remote should be a thing that accelerates. But there's some part of me that wrestles a little bit at the distinction between remote and closed, or untouched and touched. At this point, Antarctica is touched by us, the Amazon is touched by us, even if we like to think of them as these mythical, untouched places. \nI think in general, yes, we see something and we care more about it. The older I get, the more I'm trying to turn that curiosity closer to home. I can walk around my neighbourhood with my three-year-old and see all these amazing butterfly bushes and mini ecosystems in my neighbour's yards. And I think that we can also treat those places with the same kind of wonder and enchantment that we might treat Antarctica or the Amazon.\nWhat are some things anyone taking a trip to Antarctica should know? \nThe first person to see Antarctica saw it just over 200 years ago. This is a place so powerful it literally held humans at arm's length for the overwhelming majority of human history. There is no other place on the planet like that. Every other place you go has indigenous stories rising up out of it for thousands of years. This is the only place on the planet where there is none of that. And so, I think it demands a certain amount of respect and awareness that it is like an agent in its own right. \nTo be able to get close to it is so rare and so new in the history of the planet. So, if you're going to go there, I want you to go there with that awareness of just how extraordinary what you're doing is and just how powerful a place Antarctica is that you're visiting. \nHow did seeing this massive glacier slowly melt away affect you? \nThe day we arrived at Thwaites glacier, it was really calm and our captain sailed us all along the calving front of the glacier. That was a spectacular day. Then the switch flipped, and we started working our butts off for six days: throwing sediment cores [samples from beneath the seafloor that reveal the Earth's past geology and climate] over the sides, tagging elephant seals, sending submarines under the glacier. Every day, the ice looked different. \nOn the seventh day, I woke up, went to the bridge and there were way more icebergs than before, but I didn't register it as strange and went about my work. Then, just after lunch, the chief scientist on board was looking at these two satellite images: one was Thwaites in which it was a solid ice sheet, and in the next image, it looked like an angry God had taken a hammer to the glacier and broken it into 300 icebergs. We're talking about an area of the glacier that's like maybe 15 miles wide by 10 miles deep. The first image was taken on the day we arrived, and the second image was taken on that seventh morning. [The chief scientist] looked at it and said, \"Oh my God, Thwaites has entered a period of rapid collapse. This is happening right in front of us.\" He sent that information up to the captain and the decision was made to leave the study area immediately.\nThe thing that was so shocking to me was that this collapse event could literally be happening in front of my eyes and I wouldn't know it. It was so big I missed it, which is humbling. If you can't see a glacier fall to pieces in front of you, then that means that the phenomenon is way bigger than you initially imagined and that your perspective is the wrong perspective to see it. I think that's an excellent metaphor for climate change. It's really hard for humans to see it. \nHow does going to the farthest reaches of the Earth change your view of humanity? \nIt was so otherworldly. It does make me feel how precious and miraculous it is that we exist. I felt like it was close to touching down on another planet, and to see how difficult it would be to eke out a human existence on another planet makes me really grateful for ours; and also, just really aware of what happens in Antarctica doesn't stay in Antarctica. The Antarctic circumpolar current that swirls around Antarctica is the piston in the pump that drives worldwide ocean circulation patterns. We're starting to change that current. As we're changing that current, we're changing global ocean patterns all over the world. This sense that we live in a big, interconnected web of ecosystems definitely grew with seeing Antarctica and spending so much time there. \nAfter this latest project how do you feel about the future? \nHaving a child for me was an act of wilful optimism about the future. And now that my child is here, I do think that things will probably be worse in his lifetime than I've probably fully dealt with as I thought about bringing him onto this planet. That doesn't change my decision, but it does make me feel and get more serious about having a meaningful impact in my lifetime. \nIt also makes me feel much more committed to teaching him things like how to live through uncomfortable situations and moments of big change, because I think those are coming. I think it's even more important to teach him how to work with other people and create partnerships and allegiances with other people. So, as much as I think he has to be resilient and adaptable, he also has to be part of a human community that will take care of him, and hopefully, that he will take care of.\n--\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".

Rush's latest book, The Quickening, chronicles this historic voyage to Thwaites' calving edge – a frigid, far-flung place never-before visited by humans.\nRush sat down with BBC Travel to discuss her Antarctic odyssey, how it changed her perception of the world and the ethics around travelling to some of the Earth's most fragile ecosystems.\nWhere is Thwaites glacier and how did you first hear about this expedition? \nThwaites Glacier is this really enigmatic place in Antarctica. It's in the far reaches of the Amundsen Sea. It was a four-day journey to the nearest research base. When I signed up to be part of this mission, my programme officer said to me, \"You know, it's easier for us to get help to folks working on the space station than it is just to get help to you guys if you have trouble.\" There's concern that Thwaites is entering a rapid period of collapse, but the reality is that no one had ever been to [its calving edge]. \nI applied to be part of the mission through the Antarctic Artists & Writers Program. They send usually two writers or artists per year to Antarctica, and I put together a 60-page application. There was a paragraph-long footnote to my application that was like: \"I write about sea level rise. I want to go to these different places in Antarctica and see the sort of sea level rise firsthand.\" I was very lucky I was given the last berth on this ice-breaking vessel. \nWhat kind of global effects would it have if sea levels were to rise 10ft or more? \nWell, the speed with which it happens makes a tremendous difference. So, 10ft over two centuries is really different than 10ft over 40 years. The concern is really what do human beings do about it? \nI'm a huge proponent of managed retreat, which is having a government entity intervene in low-lying areas and essentially purchase flood-prone homes for pre-flooding value, giving the folks who live there the opportunity to take that money and move up and in with it. \nNew York City has already done some managed retreat on Staten Island. The state intervened and they purchased and demolished over 500 homes on Staten Island. Eighty percent of those residents were able to take the money that they were given for their home and move elsewhere on Staten Island. We sometimes think that managed retreat is like fracturing communities, and that's not necessarily how it plays out. \nSo, sea level rise is not catastrophic if we prepare for it – and that's a big if.\nWhy do you think that you were one of the people chosen to be part of this expedition? \nIn the application, I wrote about how I would write a book that would have my narration as the main thrust but would include the voices of scientists and crew working in these places. The goal was to build a kind of polyphonic chorus to subtly shift who we think of as the narrator of Antarctic stories. \nThe first person to see Antarctica saw it, like, 200 years ago, and in this very short window of time, we've told a very narrow story about Antarctica – one that has a lot to do with human conquest and human beings overcoming incredible odds to do the unthinkable. Often those human beings are white men from the global north. All the stories about Antarctica sort of sound the same. I wanted to create a story about Antarctica that was much more democratic. From the get-go, I knew I was going to interview the cooks, the engineers, the Antarctic support staff on board. I think that that played a significant role in getting the application selected because, it was like, I'm going to talk about the science, but I'm going to do it in a way that challenges some of the dominant narratives we tell about Antarctica. \nAre there any stories that stuck with you about how this epic voyage changed the way travellers not normally included in the Antarctica narrative see the world? \nI remember talking to a guy named Jack who was a cook on the vessel. He's from New Orleans, and he signed up to be a cook on this expedition to help better take care of his grandfather financially. His grandfather died a couple weeks before we were to set sail and Jack still came. He had never been on a plane. He went on three different flights to get from New Orleans to Punta Arenas, [Chile], where we set sail. He'd never been on a ship. He'd never seen penguins. And even coming from New Orleans, he had never thought super-seriously about sea level rise. This whole experience was full of firsts for him. \nHaving the time to ponder the future of climate change can be a thing that folks do who are not trying to put food on the table every single day. But when he saw Thwaites, I remember him being like, 'Oh, I get it.' The glacier itself, when we arrived, it looked like arriving at The Wall in Game of Thrones. It was so big. It took us three weeks to get there. You feel like you're as far away from human beings as you possibly can be. And to imagine that our actions so far away are literally causing this epic wall to fall apart, it gives you goosebumps.\nThere's an ongoing debate about the kinds of places we should and shouldn't visit on Earth. One thought is to leave these hard-to-reach, fragile ecosystems alone. Another view is that witnessing their fragility up close leads people to care more deeply about them. What places, if any, do you think we shouldn't visit? \nIt's a great question, and I can only answer it from a really personal level. When we crossed back over the Southern Ocean, I knew I would never go back [to Antarctica]. I knew that my going was a one-time thing and that it made sense in the context of me coming back and working for five years to write a book about the expedition. Without that deeper meaning or impulse behind the trip, I wouldn't feel right making it. \nI can say strongly that in the context of casual tourism, I don't think we should go to Antarctica. I don't think that cruise ships should go there. I don't think that casual tourism to these places that feel \"untouched\" or remote should be a thing that accelerates. But there's some part of me that wrestles a little bit at the distinction between remote and closed, or untouched and touched. At this point, Antarctica is touched by us, the Amazon is touched by us, even if we like to think of them as these mythical, untouched places. \nI think in general, yes, we see something and we care more about it. The older I get, the more I'm trying to turn that curiosity closer to home. I can walk around my neighbourhood with my three-year-old and see all these amazing butterfly bushes and mini ecosystems in my neighbour's yards. And I think that we can also treat those places with the same kind of wonder and enchantment that we might treat Antarctica or the Amazon.\nWhat are some things anyone taking a trip to Antarctica should know? \nThe first person to see Antarctica saw it just over 200 years ago. This is a place so powerful it literally held humans at arm's length for the overwhelming majority of human history. There is no other place on the planet like that. Every other place you go has indigenous stories rising up out of it for thousands of years. This is the only place on the planet where there is none of that. And so, I think it demands a certain amount of respect and awareness that it is like an agent in its own right. \nTo be able to get close to it is so rare and so new in the history of the planet. So, if you're going to go there, I want you to go there with that awareness of just how extraordinary what you're doing is and just how powerful a place Antarctica is that you're visiting. \nHow did seeing this massive glacier slowly melt away affect you? \nThe day we arrived at Thwaites glacier, it was really calm and our captain sailed us all along the calving front of the glacier. That was a spectacular day. Then the switch flipped, and we started working our butts off for six days: throwing sediment cores [samples from beneath the seafloor that reveal the Earth's past geology and climate] over the sides, tagging elephant seals, sending submarines under the glacier. Every day, the ice looked different. \nOn the seventh day, I woke up, went to the bridge and there were way more icebergs than before, but I didn't register it as strange and went about my work. Then, just after lunch, the chief scientist on board was looking at these two satellite images: one was Thwaites in which it was a solid ice sheet, and in the next image, it looked like an angry God had taken a hammer to the glacier and broken it into 300 icebergs. We're talking about an area of the glacier that's like maybe 15 miles wide by 10 miles deep. The first image was taken on the day we arrived, and the second image was taken on that seventh morning. [The chief scientist] looked at it and said, \"Oh my God, Thwaites has entered a period of rapid collapse. This is happening right in front of us.\" He sent that information up to the captain and the decision was made to leave the study area immediately.\nThe thing that was so shocking to me was that this collapse event could literally be happening in front of my eyes and I wouldn't know it. It was so big I missed it, which is humbling. If you can't see a glacier fall to pieces in front of you, then that means that the phenomenon is way bigger than you initially imagined and that your perspective is the wrong perspective to see it. I think that's an excellent metaphor for climate change. It's really hard for humans to see it. \nHow does going to the farthest reaches of the Earth change your view of humanity? \nIt was so otherworldly. It does make me feel how precious and miraculous it is that we exist. I felt like it was close to touching down on another planet, and to see how difficult it would be to eke out a human existence on another planet makes me really grateful for ours; and also, just really aware of what happens in Antarctica doesn't stay in Antarctica. The Antarctic circumpolar current that swirls around Antarctica is the piston in the pump that drives worldwide ocean circulation patterns. We're starting to change that current. As we're changing that current, we're changing global ocean patterns all over the world. This sense that we live in a big, interconnected web of ecosystems definitely grew with seeing Antarctica and spending so much time there. \nAfter this latest project how do you feel about the future? \nHaving a child for me was an act of wilful optimism about the future. And now that my child is here, I do think that things will probably be worse in his lifetime than I've probably fully dealt with as I thought about bringing him onto this planet. That doesn't change my decision, but it does make me feel and get more serious about having a meaningful impact in my lifetime. \nIt also makes me feel much more committed to teaching him things like how to live through uncomfortable situations and moments of big change, because I think those are coming. I think it's even more important to teach him how to work with other people and create partnerships and allegiances with other people. So, as much as I think he has to be resilient and adaptable, he also has to be part of a human community that will take care of him, and hopefully, that he will take care of.\n--\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".

{"doc_id": 72, "question": "What is the name of the train that allows passengers to travel the 115km journey from Interlaken to Montreux without changing trains?", "answer": ["GoldenPass Express (GPX)"], "doc": "Tracing a medieval trade route through the Swiss Alps and valleys, the GoldenPass Express isn't just one of the world's most scenic train rides; it's an engineering marvel.\nAs I sink into the plush, cream-coloured leather recliner, a glass of Champagne in hand and hiking boots raised, I'm ready for a three-hour spectacle where nature takes centre stage.

Sitting in the nine-seat Prestige Class carriage in a specially designed heated, swivelling chair feels both private and personal – as if I've got the snowcapped Alps, wildflower-laced pastures and bell-adorned cows to myself.\nOpened in December 2022 and fully relaunched in June 2023 after addressing problems with track wear, The GoldenPass Express (GPX) is one of Europe's newest (and most luxurious) high-tech trains. Its 115km journey follows a medieval trade route connecting Interlaken's glaciers to Montreux's terraced vineyards, and thanks to a technological innovation, the GPX allows travellers to take one of the world's most scenic train routes without transferring, as passengers did previously.\nThe GPX is one of five premium panoramic trains within the Swiss Travel System. Individual tickets range from 56-145 Swiss francs (roughly £50-130). It's also included in the Swiss Travel Pass (starting from 244 Swiss francs – roughly £219 – and children under 16 ride free of charge) which offers unlimited access to all public transportation (trains, trams, buses and passenger ferries), 50% off mountain railways and gondolas, and free admission to more than 500 museums.\nThe train's midnight-blue exterior and classic design evoke the bygone era of the original Orient Express that still connects Paris to Istanbul. Inside, the interior is crisp and cutting-edge, the Prestige Class specially designed chairs are by Ferrari-designer firm Pininfarina and are the only such rail seats in Europe. Need lower back support? There's a button for that. Tired feet? Elevate your legs. Feeling chilly? Just press the seat warmer. Want a different view? Simply pivot your seat to face the direction of your choice. Just don't fall asleep!\nBut what truly sets the GPX apart from other luxury trains is something you can't see: it can seamlessly jump between tracks of different gauges and voltages.\nBuilt by Montreux-Oberland-Bernois Railway (MOB) in collaboration with BLS AG (BLS) in Bern, the train winds its way down from the heights of the Bernese Alps, passing the luxurious town of Gstaad, beloved by A-listers for its exclusivity and isolation, and Château d'Oex, famous for its hot air balloon festival (25 January-2 February 2025), before snaking through vineyards as it makes its dramatic descent towards the Vaudois Riviera. Finally, it reaches sun-soaked Montreux, where palms sway on the glistening shores of Lake Geneva.\nIn 1905, when MOB set out to build the GoldenPass line, the aim was to connect Francophone Montreux to German-speaking Interlaken – two big touristic and economic hubs – with a single trainline. But somewhere along the way, MOB noticed the rail wasn't the same width; the gauges varied. It took 120 years to find a system bridging the gap.\nThe world's railroads use a patchwork of varying gauges – mainly broad, standard and narrow. Railway development lacked industry standards in the 19th Century, leading to varied gauges to suit terrain, transport purpose and political influences. This is one of the main reasons why we often need to change trains when we're travelling.\nAs Trains magazine senior editor David Lassen tells the BBC, \"countries slow to settle on a single gauge paid the price with operating challenges\". Case in point: Switzerland.\nThe idea of directly connecting Lake Geneva to Lakes Thun and Brienz in Interlaken dates to the late 1800s. Since 1916, the Lucerne-Interlaken-Zweisimmen-Montreux route, known as the GoldenPass line, allowed travel between these destinations, but required two train changes because of the tracks' differing gauges. In 1928, the concept of adding a third rail was discussed.\n\"That would have required building tunnels,\" said MOB product manager Fanny Moix. She explained that this was \"technically impossible\" because of a combination of bureaucracy and the complexity of building dual-gauge tracks through a busy, complicated junction.\nStill, as Interlaken Tourism markets manager Celina Finger maintains: \"Changing trains is a huge hassle for tourists.\" It's also a reason why the GoldenPass line hasn't been as popular as its panoramic counterparts, like the Glacier Express.\nNow, instead of requiring travellers to change trains in the middle of the journey, the GPX can make the three-hour-15-minute journey directly, thanks to the revolutionary \"variable gauge bogie\". The technology, developed in 2022 after 15 years of research and costing 89m Swiss francs (£80m), was publicly funded by the cantons of Vaud, Bern, Freiburg and the Swiss Confederation. This innovation facilitates seamless transitions between narrow and standard gauges and voltage changes within seconds, effectively enabling a train to jump tracks while moving. It's a groundbreaking new standard in rail travel – not just in Switzerland, but globally.\n\"[The GPX] is a link to our past and our future,\" said Frédéric Delachaux, MOB marketing director, explaining that it realises the centuries-old dream of linking Switzerland to Europe by rail via the Alps.\nAs I made the historic journey for the first time, approaching Zweisimmen station, I hesitated to leave the comforts of my warm seat where I was nibbling on local cheeses (there is no full-service dining on board but there are local snack options). I stretched my legs and peered out the window as we briefly paused for the locomotive change, which allows the train to adapt to the electrical voltage change. A few minutes later, we were travelling towards Schönried, a ski resort town neighbouring Gstaad, and as the train carried on, I barely felt a thing.\nMeanwhile, as the train's elevation shifted ever so slightly (rising about 200 mm) to accommodate the gauge attrition and platform height, an engineering marvel was happening right below my feet – even if only a discerning train aficionado would notice it.\n\"It's a big frustration for us in marketing because you don't feel anything!\" lamented Delachaux. Perhaps the engineers did too good a job. Because of this, the gauge change is displayed on a screen to passengers as it's happening.\nMore like this:• A new night train connecting some of Europe's great cities • One of the world's most scenic train lines • Europe's narrowest-gauge train\nWhile there are other trains in France and Japan that can move a few centimetres, \"this is the only train in the world that moves 43cm\", said Delachaux.\nIt's perhaps no surprise that the Swiss were able to pull off this engineering feat. Living in a landlocked nation that's 70% mountainous and filled with some 1,500 lakes, people here have long had to negotiate the obstacles posed by their challenging terrain – and along the way, exemplified a certain determination and ingenuity that is decidedly Swiss.\nAs Clarence Rook wrote in his 1907 book Switzerland and Its People: \"There are bigger mountains in the world than may be found in Switzerland. But you will nowhere find in so small a space so many triumphs of engineering.

{"doc_id": 73, "question": "Who is the first Olympic medallist from St Lucia?", "answer": ["Julien Alfred"], "doc": "A big Olympic win and a shout out from an R&B celebrity call attention to what makes this island so special.\nAs soon as travellers land at St Lucia's Hewanorra International Airport, it becomes clear how this small Caribbean nation feels about its hometown athlete, Julien Alfred. A poster of the sprinter, who recently became the nation's first Olympic medallist when she won gold in the women's 100m, now sits in the arrivals hall, greeting visitors to this island paradise.\n\"We're so proud of Julien Alfred being the fastest woman in the world,\" Cuthbert \"Twatinay\" Modeste, a St Lucian track and field coach who has trained Alfred since she was 11, told the BBC. \"We can't wait to share our excitement and embrace anyone who is inspired to visit us because of Julien.\"\nKnown for its warm tropical climate, lush Des Cartiers rainforest and the towering twin Piton mountains, St Lucia has long been a popular destination for honeymooners. However, the country's recent Olympic win and a new album by Beyoncé protegee Chloe Bailey inspired by St Lucia is leading the tiny island nation to have a big and rather unexpected moment. Now, officials are eager to highlight that there is much more to their home than just cruises and all-inclusive resorts.\n\"Julien Alfred's remarkable achievements on the global stage at the Paris Olympics have brought immense pride to St Lucia. Her dedication and success as an athlete not only highlight her extraordinary talent, but also serve as a powerful testament to the strength and spirit of our island,\" said Anya Whitfield, Acting CEO of the St Lucia Tourism Authority.\nIn the days after Alfred's historic Olympic win, the island's official tourism board made her the face of its #LetHerInspireYou marketing campaign – so coined because St Lucia is the only sovereign nation in the world named after a real-life woman. The island is hoping to use the attention garnered by the newly minted world's fastest woman to invite visitors to \"explore St Lucia like an Olympian\".\nAccording to Modeste, the island's natural landscape contributed to Alfred's Olympic win. The sprinter participated in training exercises on the powdery sand of Vigie Beach, a local favourite near the capital city of Castries. She is also known to enjoy mud baths in the Sulphur Springs natural hot springs in the western town of Soufrière, which are known for their therapeutic properties, including the ability to ease sore muscles and calm sunburn.\nListed as one of the 2023's best islands in the world, the 617 sq km volcanic island is known for its dramatic landscapes, with dense, humid jungle covering towering mountainous formations. Hiking is an especially beloved pastime, with numerous hiking trails for all levels, from leisurely beach-side strolls to more strenuous mountain ascents. One of the most popular hikes is the 4.4km trek to the summit of the iconic Gros Piton Mountain, one of two peaks that soar over Jalousie Beach, a powdery white-sand crescent surrounded by coral reefs. The hike may seem short, but it's considered particularly challenging due to the 798m elevation gain.\nFor those more interested in the water than the land, the island also has stunning beaches to explore, including several volcanic black sand beaches, and excellent diving spots like the Anse Piton Marine Reserve.\nThe island's food scene offers a unique window into its history. St Lucian cuisine is influenced by the French, English and African cultures that have historically shaped and continue to shape the nation, as well as the plethora of local ingredients available from both the ocean and the land, like breadfruit and \"Shadow Benny\", the local name for the herb culantro. The island's national dish, green fig and saltfish, made with boiled unripe bananas and salt-cured cod fish, can be found at almost any local eatery on the island. Other dishes to try include lambi, a kind of conch stew, and callaloo, a ubiquitous Caribbean favourite similar to spinach often made into soups or added to stew.\nJulien Alfred isn't the only big name causing the world to look towards St Lucia this year. American R&B musician Chloe Bailey headlined the island's annual Jazz & Arts Festival in April 2024. Bailey has stated that her most recent album, Trouble in Paradise, was inspired by the solace, acceptance and creativity she found on the island – even calling St Lucia her \"second home\". Parts of her visual album, including both videos and vocals, were recorded at Windjammer Landing Resort & Residences in St Lucia's Labrelotte Bay.\n\"St Lucia has completely fuelled my mind, body, soul, spirit and heart with inspiration and love. I have never felt this liberated before in my life,\" Bailey stated in a joint press release with St Lucia Tourism. \"I was able to create this body of work in a space where I feel the most free and happy, literally writing away my troubles in paradise.\"\nPartially because of this newfound attention, the St Lucia Tourism Authority says the island is preparing for an influx of guests.

{"doc_id": 73, "question": "What is the name of the marketing campaign launched by St Lucia’s tourism board after Julien Alfred’s Olympic win?", "answer": ["#LetHerInspireYou"], "doc": "A big Olympic win and a shout out from an R&B celebrity call attention to what makes this island so special.\nAs soon as travellers land at St Lucia's Hewanorra International Airport, it becomes clear how this small Caribbean nation feels about its hometown athlete, Julien Alfred. A poster of the sprinter, who recently became the nation's first Olympic medallist when she won gold in the women's 100m, now sits in the arrivals hall, greeting visitors to this island paradise.\n\"We're so proud of Julien Alfred being the fastest woman in the world,\" Cuthbert \"Twatinay\" Modeste, a St Lucian track and field coach who has trained Alfred since she was 11, told the BBC. \"We can't wait to share our excitement and embrace anyone who is inspired to visit us because of Julien.\"\nKnown for its warm tropical climate, lush Des Cartiers rainforest and the towering twin Piton mountains, St Lucia has long been a popular destination for honeymooners. However, the country's recent Olympic win and a new album by Beyoncé protegee Chloe Bailey inspired by St Lucia is leading the tiny island nation to have a big and rather unexpected moment. Now, officials are eager to highlight that there is much more to their home than just cruises and all-inclusive resorts.\n\"Julien Alfred's remarkable achievements on the global stage at the Paris Olympics have brought immense pride to St Lucia. Her dedication and success as an athlete not only highlight her extraordinary talent, but also serve as a powerful testament to the strength and spirit of our island,\" said Anya Whitfield, Acting CEO of the St Lucia Tourism Authority.\nIn the days after Alfred's historic Olympic win, the island's official tourism board made her the face of its #LetHerInspireYou marketing campaign – so coined because St Lucia is the only sovereign nation in the world named after a real-life woman. The island is hoping to use the attention garnered by the newly minted world's fastest woman to invite visitors to \"explore St Lucia like an Olympian\".\nAccording to Modeste, the island's natural landscape contributed to Alfred's Olympic win. The sprinter participated in training exercises on the powdery sand of Vigie Beach, a local favourite near the capital city of Castries. She is also known to enjoy mud baths in the Sulphur Springs natural hot springs in the western town of Soufrière, which are known for their therapeutic properties, including the ability to ease sore muscles and calm sunburn.\nListed as one of the 2023's best islands in the world, the 617 sq km volcanic island is known for its dramatic landscapes, with dense, humid jungle covering towering mountainous formations. Hiking is an especially beloved pastime, with numerous hiking trails for all levels, from leisurely beach-side strolls to more strenuous mountain ascents. One of the most popular hikes is the 4.4km trek to the summit of the iconic Gros Piton Mountain, one of two peaks that soar over Jalousie Beach, a powdery white-sand crescent surrounded by coral reefs. The hike may seem short, but it's considered particularly challenging due to the 798m elevation gain.\nFor those more interested in the water than the land, the island also has stunning beaches to explore, including several volcanic black sand beaches, and excellent diving spots like the Anse Piton Marine Reserve.\nThe island's food scene offers a unique window into its history. St Lucian cuisine is influenced by the French, English and African cultures that have historically shaped and continue to shape the nation, as well as the plethora of local ingredients available from both the ocean and the land, like breadfruit and \"Shadow Benny\", the local name for the herb culantro. The island's national dish, green fig and saltfish, made with boiled unripe bananas and salt-cured cod fish, can be found at almost any local eatery on the island. Other dishes to try include lambi, a kind of conch stew, and callaloo, a ubiquitous Caribbean favourite similar to spinach often made into soups or added to stew.\nJulien Alfred isn't the only big name causing the world to look towards St Lucia this year. American R&B musician Chloe Bailey headlined the island's annual Jazz & Arts Festival in April 2024. Bailey has stated that her most recent album, Trouble in Paradise, was inspired by the solace, acceptance and creativity she found on the island – even calling St Lucia her \"second home\". Parts of her visual album, including both videos and vocals, were recorded at Windjammer Landing Resort & Residences in St Lucia's Labrelotte Bay.\n\"St Lucia has completely fuelled my mind, body, soul, spirit and heart with inspiration and love. I have never felt this liberated before in my life,\" Bailey stated in a joint press release with St Lucia Tourism. \"I was able to create this body of work in a space where I feel the most free and happy, literally writing away my troubles in paradise.\"\nPartially because of this newfound attention, the St Lucia Tourism Authority says the island is preparing for an influx of guests.

{"doc_id": 74, "question": "Where was the world’s first capsule hotel founded?", "answer": ["Osaka, Japan"], "doc": "From Colombia's upcycled sewer pipes to spheres suspended in the sky in Canada, capsule hotels have been reinvented for a new generation of travellers.\nBy night, the world's first capsule hotel (founded in Osaka, Japan in 1979) must have looked like a morgue, with neat rows of narrow sleeping capsules each containing a recumbent body. But the following day, the occupants – mostly businessmen who had worked late - would rise up and head back to the office, grateful for this efficient sleep solution that had saved them a commute home in the early hours.  \nAs the concept spread, tourists happy to sleep in a room no bigger than its bed began to bunk up alongside them, eager to sample this unusual aspect of Japanese culture. Fast-forward to today, and high hotel room rates, fuelled by years of rising real estate prices, have supercharged this typically low-cost concept, which offers budget travellers priced out of traditional hotels more privacy than a hostel dormitory and more comfort and connectivity than camping. The capsules, which are predominantly single-occupancy, also answer the current boom in solo travel, with single-sex capsule hotels providing additional security.\nWith the global capsule hotel market projected to reach $327m by 2031, curious hybrids have emerged to sustain the trend and attract new customers. They're tempting the TikTok generation with increasingly outlandish forms, from upcycled sewer pipes in the Colombian desert to space-age pods with a dashboard of ambient controls in downtown Sydney, Australia – all promising a unique experience and shareable stories for social media. Meanwhile capsule-cum-bookstores invite book lovers to snooze among the shelves, and boutique versions bring luxury to a traditionally no-frills market with fancy decor or promises of fluffy duck-feather duvets.\nAs the concept continues to reinvent itself, here are eight of the most extraordinary examples.\nNine Hours, a chain of 13 hotels across Japan, from Fukuoka in the west to the north-east island of Hokkaido, has an unusual by-product: sleep data. In the Shinagawa Station (men only) and Akasaka branches, guests can sign up for a \"9h sleep fitscan\" service, where sensors detect everything from breathing to facial expressions to generate a sleep report that tracks their heart rate, identifies sleep apnea and even monitors snoring. In a sector where a novel or low-budget stay is often prioritised over comfort, Nine Hours' interest in how well its guests are sleeping sets it apart.\nAcross the franchise, the white, minimalist decor continues this clinical theme, while its rows of sleek, shiny sleeping pods would not look out of place on the set of a science-fiction movie. The name refers to the hotel's cost-cutting concept that reduces room rental to the essential nine hours, allowing seven hours for sleep and an hour on either side for washing and dressing. Just need a nap? Hourly rates are also available.\nA night in a transparent sleeping pod clinging to a cliff face above Peru's Sacred Valley is not everyone's idea of a relaxing stay, but for adrenaline-lovers, it's hard to beat – not least for the incredible 300-degree views of the surrounding mountains and the formidable condors that inhabit them.\nA near-vertical climb of 400m is the only way to reach the Skylodge Adventure Suites, but climbing experience is not necessary – only good health and a head for heights – and descending is speedier thanks to a series of zip wires. Each capsule includes a private bathroom ensuring that night trips to the toilet are not life-threatening, and when the sun rises, you can enjoy a cup of tea on your private deck. Looking for a little more luxury? A little further down the Urubamba river, sister site, Starlodge, adds hillside hot tubs to the capsule hotel experience.\nThe Tubo Hotel, La Tatacoa is just a 10-minute drive from Colombia's second-largest desert, the eponymous Tatacoa, famous for its clear starry skies. When you've taken in the giant cacti and curious rock formations of the Tatacoa's cinnamon-coloured sands, this rainbow of tiny, air-conditioned rooms with a shared swimming pool offers a welcome oasis. The 37 capsules are fashioned from concrete sewer pipes painted in candy colours, providing just enough room for a double bed. Almost half of the rooms have a shared bathroom, but the room rate is a snip and you've a shady garden, bar and restaurant on your doorstep. \"This innovative and colourful place offers you a unique experience,\" says Ambar Quintana, the hotel's administrator. \"It has everything you need to rest in a natural environment of fresh air and vegetation.\"\nSuspended among the conifers like oversized Christmas baubles, the Free Spirit Spheres on Vancouver Island, Canada, feel \"like you are floating in the canopy among the sleeping birds\", according to owner Tom Chudleigh. The first sphere was introduced 25 years ago, driven by a desire to promote ecotourism and preserve Canada's ancient forests.\nMore like this:\n• The UK's five most beautiful national parks• The best travel photographs from around the globe• The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world\nThere are currently three spheres, each based on the principle of biomimicry and shaped with a giant seed pod or nutshell in mind: light but with a strong shell. \"Eryn\" is fashioned from Sitka spruce and has a dining area, sink and slightly undersized double bed inside; while more recent additions, \"Melody\" and \"Luna\", are fibreglass and have similar amenities but with full-size double beds that can be stowed. Each sphere is accessed via a spiral staircase wrapped around a tree, and is available to rent in temperatures as low as -20C, when even a trip to the composting toilet at the accommodation's base will feel intrepid.\nThe shape makes bespoke fittings a prerequisite, and every little detail has been meticulously crafted by Chudleigh, from walnut fold-out furniture that maximises the space, to door handles cast from bronze.\nInside a Brutalist building in Singapore's Chinatown lies a surprisingly serene interior. Opened in 2021 and based on an aesthetic it describes as \"soft minimalist\", KINN Capsule offers a Zen take on the capsule concept with walls painted in calming peachy tones and pale wood sleeping chambers fitted with crisp white bed linen. Even the smell of the place seems an antidote to its urban location as a special house fragrance designed to evoke the wildflowers of a Nordic forest hangs in the air. There are 72 capsules in total, sealed off with blackout blinds and spread across seven rooms, but the vibe is more boutique than bunkhouse.\nA traditional mud and wood farmhouse in eastern China's Zhejiang Province got a prize-winning makeover in 2019 when it reopened as a capsule hostel, bookstore and community library, sleeping 20 in tiny single bed-sized compartments concealed between bookshelves made of local bamboo. A smattering of small landings are connected by zigzagging stairways that recall the serpentine paths of the surrounding forests of Tonglu. It's hard to know which is more dramatic: the remote building's transparent floor-to-ceiling panels that light it up like a cathedral at night, or the lush mountainous scenery that's visible through them.\nIn Oud Zuid, one of Amsterdam's most upscale neighbourhoods, guests are paying to sleep in cupboards. The quirky De Bedstee Hotel draws on the 17th-Century tradition of the Dutch bedstee (box bed), a bed concealed behind cupboard doors to create a cosy sleeping nook. The hotel's Art Deco features and acid-coloured wallpapers downstairs give way to a shabby-chic design in the first-floor dormitories, where the bedstee windows are framed by red gingham curtains and little wooden ladders lead to the capsules above. Relax in the hotel's small terrace garden or take a half-hour stroll to the Rembrandt House Museum in the city centre to see several historic box beds in situ.\nAnother hotel with a signature smell is the Resol Poshtel in Tokyo's Asakusa district – the Resol Hotel chain's first venture into capsule sleeping. The aroma, which includes orange, chamomile and neroli, is said to induce \"a feeling of gentle calm\" – of benefit, perhaps, given the communal sleeping arrangements. At bedtime, there's nothing but a curtain between you and fellow visitors, but few one-star establishments can match this hotel's cleanliness and functionality, with hairbrushes, slippers and razors included in the freebies. The Edo-era styling − such as the sleeping cubicles' arched entrance reminiscent of tea ceremony rooms, and the traditional Japanese murals surrounding the bed − add a hint of heritage to the hotel's modern lines. The city's oldest Buddhist temple, Sensō-ji, is a five-minute walk away, as is the lantern-lined Nakamise-dori street, home to a parade of colourful shops selling souvenirs and street food.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

{"doc_id": 75, "question": "What is the name of the beach that Craig Foster recommends for diving due to its calmer conditions?", "answer": ["False Bay"], "doc": "His devotion to the world's oceans won him an Oscar. Now he shares his favourite things to do in Cape Town, from whale spotting in False Bay to freediving in the kelp forests.\nSituated at the southern tip of Africa and surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, Cape Town's identity is woven with its waters. Once a refuelling station for the Dutch East India Company, its history goes further back – to the Khoekhoe and San Indigenous peoples, nomadic pastoralists and hunter-gatherers who once inhabited the region and lived off the land and sea.\nCape Town's intimate relationship with its coastline continues to the present day. Capetonians all seem to have at least one outdoorsy hobby, and it's not hard to understand why: in a single day, it’s possible to hike to the picturesque Lion's Head peak, go surfing at Muizenberg beach and dive the kelp forests of False Bay, thanks to the density of activities on offer. Winters in South Africa are often milder than in Europe, coinciding with climbing season (the nearby Cederberg mountains feature world-class routes) and whale migrations up the coast.\nWith no shortage of adventures, we spoke to renowned naturalist, author and documentarian Craig Foster, the creator behind the Academy Award-winning 2020 documentary My Octopus Teacher, about his favourite coastal activities. His latest book, Amphibious Soul: Finding the Wild in a Tame World, explores the importance of reconnecting with our intrinsic sense of wildness and relationship with the natural world, and there is perhaps no better place to experience this than in South Africa – where Foster grew up, a place he calls \"the heart of the world\".\nHere are Foster's favourite coastal adventures in Cape Town.\nFoster begins each day with a dive – a habit he has maintained for years thanks to its profound positive effects on his mind and body.\n\"Windmill Beach is a beautiful spot to dive,\" he says, referencing a popular beach on the Cape Peninsula. Foster encourages beginners to stick to the False Bay side as opposed to the Atlantic seaboard, thanks to the former's generally calmer conditions: \"It's usually protected from swell.\" Because the beach sits within the boundaries of a protected area, fishing and marine harvesting are prohibited. Once you’re underwater, expect to see various species of seaweed and kelp, along with shoals of fish, octopus and even small shy sharks darting between the boulders.\nDon't be fooled by the turquoise colours though. Cape Town's water temperatures can sometimes plunge into the single digits, especially in dive sites along the Atlantic. While Foster dives without a wetsuit, it takes time to build up a cold tolerance. \"Embrace the cold, but don't push it,\" he instructs. \"Enjoy the dopamine rush afterwards.\"\nOne of Foster's preferred ways to end a dive? Climbing out to lie on a Sun-warmed boulder, followed by a braai (South African barbecue) next to the ocean.\nAt the end of the Cape Peninsula is the Cape Point Nature Reserve, home to the Cape of Good Hope and a sprawling landscape of fynbos shrubbery and endemic species such as Chacma baboons and Cape clawless otter.

{"doc_id": 76, "question": "What is the name of the dive site where red snapper spawn in Palau?", "answer": ["Shark City"], "doc": "The full Moon is a mating call for one of the ocean's most extraordinary phenomena, when thousands of red snapper gather in what can only be described as a frenzied fish orgy.\nAt 06:00, our small boat was floating a few miles from shore in the island nation of Palau, the early morning sun occasionally reflecting off the gentle curve of the waves. Eight divers were perched on the side of the boat, backs out, wetsuits on, scuba diving air valves fully open. But we were in a holding pattern, heads bobbing from both surface swells and lingering fatigue. Though ours were drooping, our captain's eyes were fixed on the point where our scuba diving guide had submerged minutes prior. The objective: locating Lutjanus bohar, commonly known as red snapper.\nBut one fish wouldn't do — we were looking for at least 1,000. Five thousand would be better.\nSuddenly, our guide's hand shot skyward, indicating he'd spotted what had brought us to this place at this time: an amorphous, ephemeral mass of snapper that regularly spawn at this particular dive site, called Shark City.\nA quick reverse count from three, and we backrolled into the water as one unit, quickly descending to 31m below the surface. The depth put us eye to bulging fish eye with one of Palau's most inexplicable marine phenomena: a snapper spawning aggregation, a breathtaking ballet of nature driven by an unknown biological code. \nHere, three days before the full Moon every month, these fish gather in what can only be described as a frenzied fish orgy. As the tide turned, the shimmering sphere of bodies grew denser, becoming roughly the size of a football field as it moved toward the surface. As if on cue, the females released their eggs, triggering a flurry of activity from the males as they darted through the massive school in a hectic attempt to maximise fertilisation — and a flurry of movement from divers as we tried to keep up with the action. We ascended with the fishy mass, not knowing where to look and attempting to clumsily adjust our underwater cameras before the influx of genetic material clouded the otherwise-clear water.\nThis weirdly specific, oddly appealing mating event likely unfolds in oceans around the world, but Palau's two sites — Shark City, and one near Peleliu Island – are the only known fixed locations where red snapper spawnings happen on a regular basis and are accessible to divers. And with recreational divers limited to depths of about 20m, and advanced divers to no more than 40m, finding spawnings is no easy task.\n\"There are probably sites like that every 10 or 20 miles but we just don't know where they are,\" said Mandy Etpison of NECO Marine dive shop in Palau's capital city of Koror. As the first PADI-certified instructor in Palau in 1985, Etpison helped pioneer the island's then-nascent dive industry and has authored several books on its ecology. She recalls that it was 2009 when a local dive shop confirmed two of the island’s best known spawning phenomena: red snapper near the full Moon at a dive site called Shark City, where we were; and bumphead parrotfish around the new Moon at a nearby site called Ulong Sandbar.\nSince then, research on reef fish behaviour has been minimal. Scientists think fertilisation coincides with the start of the outgoing current to maximise the dispersal of eggs into the open ocean. But the question of how these fish navigate this complex dance, how they pinpoint the exact time and location to spawn, remains a mystery.\n\"I don't know if there's really been any work on that yet. They get cues from the Moon, I think,\" said Christina Muller-Karanassos, who leads the fisheries research projects at Palau's International Coral Reef Research Center. \"At spawns, you get some immature fish that follow bigger fish to the site. So maybe they learn.\"\nEven the discovery of most spawning aggregations happens by accident, either based on reports from fisherman or \"just by dumb luck\", as Etpison says, as Palau dive operators look for new sites to help disperse the growing number of dive tourists. \"So it's just more eyes in the water.\"\nFor scientists, data collected during the few aggregation studies underway will guide future marine conservation efforts in Palau, a country with rare species like dugongs and ancient nautilus. In addition, scientists have found that several of the country's 700 coral species seem resistant to bleaching, which they hope to study to learn how to protect other coral species around the world.\nIn 2009, the same year the snapper and bumphead spawnings were confirmed, Palau created the world's first shark sanctuary, banning the fishing of 350 shark species in an area the size of France. In 2015, more than 80% of that area became the Palau National Marine Sanctuary (PNMS), which banned offshore fishing of any type starting a few miles offshore around Palau's islands. Currently under consideration is a fisheries management plan to tighten regulations in the water immediately offshore, which is part of the shark reserve, but not part of the sanctuary. The plan proposes measures such as complete bans on fishing specific species — like red snapper — and restrictions on fishing around known spawning grounds for three days before and after spawns occur.\n\"A lot of the time, these are also commercially important fish, and it's so easy to catch them during an aggregation. So protecting them is extremely important,\" Muller-Karanassos said. \"If you fish them all out, then you're not going to have those top predators there, so the food web will be off.\"\nWitnessing Palau's red snapper spawning aggregations are as much about luck as anything else. Though our liveaboard dive schedule was centred around the spawnings, we missed it on our first attempt, diving in about 20 minutes too early. Beforehand, we'd been taught how to use metal reef hooks to counteract the currents, but our claw-shaped hooks easily detached from their formerly secure holds in the rocky bottom each time the swells shifted direction. The spawn happens around sunrise but the precise timing can fluctuate, and the gas blends in our diving cylinders limited us to about 20 minutes at the 30m depth before we needed to begin our ascent. Fortunately, we caught the spawning on the next day's attempt.\nLuckily for us – or not, depending on one's proclivity for sharks – we were not the only voyeurs on the second day of the fishy bacchanal.\nMore like this:• Palau's world-first 'good traveller' incentive• Australia's X-rated underwater show• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\nThe undersea phenomenon acts as a siren song for apex predators, drawing everything from opportunistic great barracuda and common gray reef sharks to larger open-ocean species like oceanic black tip and bull sharks. \"They're just focused on the fish,\" Etpison says of bull sharks, though she cautions that divers ought not to get between them and the snapper. \nIndeed, on our spawning dive, we saw not one but two bull sharks circling on the outskirts of the action. For all we know, they were there the entire time, but we weren't able to see them through the density of fish, sperm and egg. Fortunately, they were on the opposite side of us as the spawning, closer to the open ocean.\nThat may capture the essence of diving in Palau. Thanks to the shark sanctuary and marine conservation zones, efforts like the Palau Pledge (a sustainability mandate visitors must stamp in their passports) and the continued efforts of diving operators to lobby for responsible tourism, no dive has a singular draw. A dive to a manta cleaning station will also be packed with sea turtles; a dive through an underwater cavern may include the chance to spot the natural flashing lights of the aptly named \"disco clam\". The rarity of seeing the bull sharks or a snapper spawning would be the clear highlight of a dive trip anywhere else in the world. But in Palau, it’s just another day on the reef.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

And with recreational divers limited to depths of about 20m, and advanced divers to no more than 40m, finding spawnings is no easy task.\n\"There are probably sites like that every 10 or 20 miles but we just don't know where they are,\" said Mandy Etpison of NECO Marine dive shop in Palau's capital city of Koror. As the first PADI-certified instructor in Palau in 1985, Etpison helped pioneer the island's then-nascent dive industry and has authored several books on its ecology. She recalls that it was 2009 when a local dive shop confirmed two of the island’s best known spawning phenomena: red snapper near the full Moon at a dive site called Shark City, where we were; and bumphead parrotfish around the new Moon at a nearby site called Ulong Sandbar.\nSince then, research on reef fish behaviour has been minimal. Scientists think fertilisation coincides with the start of the outgoing current to maximise the dispersal of eggs into the open ocean. But the question of how these fish navigate this complex dance, how they pinpoint the exact time and location to spawn, remains a mystery.\n\"I don't know if there's really been any work on that yet. They get cues from the Moon, I think,\" said Christina Muller-Karanassos, who leads the fisheries research projects at Palau's International Coral Reef Research Center. \"At spawns, you get some immature fish that follow bigger fish to the site. So maybe they learn.\"\nEven the discovery of most spawning aggregations happens by accident, either based on reports from fisherman or \"just by dumb luck\", as Etpison says, as Palau dive operators look for new sites to help disperse the growing number of dive tourists. \"So it's just more eyes in the water.\"\nFor scientists, data collected during the few aggregation studies underway will guide future marine conservation efforts in Palau, a country with rare species like dugongs and ancient nautilus. In addition, scientists have found that several of the country's 700 coral species seem resistant to bleaching, which they hope to study to learn how to protect other coral species around the world.\nIn 2009, the same year the snapper and bumphead spawnings were confirmed, Palau created the world's first shark sanctuary, banning the fishing of 350 shark species in an area the size of France. In 2015, more than 80% of that area became the Palau National Marine Sanctuary (PNMS), which banned offshore fishing of any type starting a few miles offshore around Palau's islands. Currently under consideration is a fisheries management plan to tighten regulations in the water immediately offshore, which is part of the shark reserve, but not part of the sanctuary. The plan proposes measures such as complete bans on fishing specific species — like red snapper — and restrictions on fishing around known spawning grounds for three days before and after spawns occur.\n\"A lot of the time, these are also commercially important fish, and it's so easy to catch them during an aggregation. So protecting them is extremely important,\" Muller-Karanassos said. \"If you fish them all out, then you're not going to have those top predators there, so the food web will be off.\"\nWitnessing Palau's red snapper spawning aggregations are as much about luck as anything else. Though our liveaboard dive schedule was centred around the spawnings, we missed it on our first attempt, diving in about 20 minutes too early. Beforehand, we'd been taught how to use metal reef hooks to counteract the currents, but our claw-shaped hooks easily detached from their formerly secure holds in the rocky bottom each time the swells shifted direction. The spawn happens around sunrise but the precise timing can fluctuate, and the gas blends in our diving cylinders limited us to about 20 minutes at the 30m depth before we needed to begin our ascent. Fortunately, we caught the spawning on the next day's attempt.\nLuckily for us – or not, depending on one's proclivity for sharks – we were not the only voyeurs on the second day of the fishy bacchanal.\nMore like this:• Palau's world-first 'good traveller' incentive• Australia's X-rated underwater show• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\nThe undersea phenomenon acts as a siren song for apex predators, drawing everything from opportunistic great barracuda and common gray reef sharks to larger open-ocean species like oceanic black tip and bull sharks. \"They're just focused on the fish,\" Etpison says of bull sharks, though she cautions that divers ought not to get between them and the snapper. \nIndeed, on our spawning dive, we saw not one but two bull sharks circling on the outskirts of the action.

{"doc_id": 76, "question": "What year did Palau create the world's first shark sanctuary?", "answer": ["2009"], "doc": "The full Moon is a mating call for one of the ocean's most extraordinary phenomena, when thousands of red snapper gather in what can only be described as a frenzied fish orgy.\nAt 06:00, our small boat was floating a few miles from shore in the island nation of Palau, the early morning sun occasionally reflecting off the gentle curve of the waves. Eight divers were perched on the side of the boat, backs out, wetsuits on, scuba diving air valves fully open. But we were in a holding pattern, heads bobbing from both surface swells and lingering fatigue. Though ours were drooping, our captain's eyes were fixed on the point where our scuba diving guide had submerged minutes prior. The objective: locating Lutjanus bohar, commonly known as red snapper.\nBut one fish wouldn't do — we were looking for at least 1,000. Five thousand would be better.\nSuddenly, our guide's hand shot skyward, indicating he'd spotted what had brought us to this place at this time: an amorphous, ephemeral mass of snapper that regularly spawn at this particular dive site, called Shark City.\nA quick reverse count from three, and we backrolled into the water as one unit, quickly descending to 31m below the surface. The depth put us eye to bulging fish eye with one of Palau's most inexplicable marine phenomena: a snapper spawning aggregation, a breathtaking ballet of nature driven by an unknown biological code. \nHere, three days before the full Moon every month, these fish gather in what can only be described as a frenzied fish orgy. As the tide turned, the shimmering sphere of bodies grew denser, becoming roughly the size of a football field as it moved toward the surface. As if on cue, the females released their eggs, triggering a flurry of activity from the males as they darted through the massive school in a hectic attempt to maximise fertilisation — and a flurry of movement from divers as we tried to keep up with the action.

{"doc_id": 77, "question": "How far is Ittoqqortoormiit from the nearest town?", "answer": ["800km"], "doc": "Frozen in for nine months every year and located 800km from the next town, Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland, offers a fascinating glimpse at life at the edge of the world.\nIn our ever-connected world, it's rare to experience true remoteness. It's also extraordinary to witness how people live in one of the Earth's most isolated places. But earlier this year during a once-in-a-lifetime photographic expedition to the most remote inhabited community in the western hemisphere, I was able to do both these things.\nIttoqqortoormiit (pronounced: it-ockor-tormit) is a 370-person village of colourfully painted homes sandwiched between the world's largest national park to the north and the largest fjord system in the world to the south. There are no roads to Ittoqqortoormiit; the only way to get there is by helicopter, boat (in the summer), snowmobile or one of two weekly flights to Nerlerit Inaat airport, roughly 40km away: one from Iceland, and the other from West Greenland.\nLocated above the Arctic Circle at 70°N and roughly 800km from the nearest town, Ittoqqortoormiit's backyard is a frigid, untamed wilderness home to polar bears, musk oxen and millions of sea birds who nest on icebergs. Sea ice freezes the village in for nine months a year, but offers a lifeline to Ittoqqortoormiit's Inuit inhabitants, who travel it by dog sled to hunt. The village will celebrate its centenary in 2025, but in recent years, its population has been shrinking (35% since 2006, by some estimates) as young people are increasingly migrating to cities to study or pursue different careers than the traditional Arctic hunting of their forefathers. What's more, as rising temperatures cause the surrounding sea ice to freeze later and melt earlier, Ittoqqortoormiit finds itself on the front lines of climate change, which is further threatening the Indigenous community's culture.\nMy winter excursion to Ittoqqortoormiit wasn't just an adventure that took me outside my comfort zone; it was one of the most challenging experiences I've ever had. After flying from Reykjavík to Nerlerit Inaat, I spent five days on the pack ice in temperatures plummeting as low as -40C. I travelled on dogsleds, slept in tents and small hunter huts (with no beds, running water, heating or facilities) and dashed 45km on a snowmobile through a white-out blizzard with 80kmph winds.\nUltimately, this turned out to be far more than a photography expedition, as it offered a rare glimpse of life in one of the most remote landscapes on Earth. It also revealed how Ittoqqortoormiit's remaining residents are struggling to adapt their deep-rooted traditions to a rapidly changing world.\nMy trip was organised by the renowned photographer Joshua Holko, who arranged for two local Inuit guides, Åge Danielsen and Manasse Tuko, to whisk myself and two other photographers across the ice on their dog sleds from the Nerlerit Inaat airport to Ittoqqortoormiit with the aim of capturing some of Earth's most stark, stunning polar landscapes.\nWe established camp in small tents close to the airport the first night as temperatures were -30C and falling. After sawing frozen cod on the snow, as a carpenter would cut through timber, and boiling it in a pan of melted ice, Danielsen and Tuko announced that dinner was ready. The cod was excellent, if bony, but we were more concerned about what lay ahead. I had never experienced cold like this before, and as we hunkered down for the night, strong winds battered the tents while the sled dogs howled when Arctic foxes and – perhaps – polar bears passed. As the temperature continued dropping, my legs soon started to cramp. It was truly a baptism by cold.\nShortly after breakfast, Danielsen and Tuko started loading our supplies. As I watched, they expertly transformed the empty dog sleds into containers on skates filled with bags, cooler boxes, camera cases, dog food and more. They skillfully tied the goods on with ropes, demonstrating skills that they explained were passed down from father to son.\nWe sat two to a sled with a guide at the front driving the dogs. For the next six days, 12 Greenland sled dogs assigned to each sled carried loads of more than 450kg and ran their hearts out for up to 25km a day. These beloved animals (called qimmiit in Greenland's Inuit language, Kalaallisut), which are a large husky-type breed, are believed to have been brought from Siberia to Greenland some 1,000 years ago by the Inuit's direct ancestors, the Thule people, and are something of a national icon in Greenland. Not only do they represent an important part of Inuit culture and their connection to the land, but as we'd soon find, they also had the advantage of being much quieter than snowmobiles, therefore improving our chances of photographing wildlife – or, in Danielsen and Tuko's case, when they weren't guiding us, hunting wildlife.\nOne morning, after eating toast heated by spearing it with a knife and holding it over a burner, Danielsen pointed up towards the mountains as the dogs carried us 10km west of Ittoqqortoormiit. We looked up and saw four musk oxen standing on a distant ridge.\nWeighing up to 400kg, these prehistoric-looking beasts, with short horns protruding from their cheeks and long-flowing black and tan fur overcoats blowing in the strong wind, were as photogenic as they were imposing. We disembarked from the sleds and proceeded with great caution, as Holko warned us that these Ice Age relics can be skittish and aggressive: move too quickly and they will run off; get too close and they will charge. After an hour of shooting these goliaths, they started climbing higher into the mountain passes, perhaps knowing that they are regarded as a local delicacy in Ittoqqortoormiit.\nOn our third day, Danielsen mentioned that he owned a hut about 25km away and invited us to spend two nights there. We were humbled by his kindness – especially because his home was strategically positioned to spot polar bears on the pack ice. The brightly painted blue hut was just large enough for a small sofa, chair, sink, stove and a rare sit-down toilet – but the most noticeable feature was the large slaughter hook hanging from the ceiling. \nIt reminded us that whilst Danielsen may have taken on guiding to supplement his income, hunting is his passion, his profession and his ancestral tradition. By law, hunters here aren't allowed to sell meat or skins from their kills – or in the case of musk ox, import them abroad. Instead, the meat can only be used to provide food and clothing for families – just as it has for generations.\nWhile at his house, we learned that Danielsen wasn't just a proud Inuit hunter but also a father of four children. He explained that his father was a hunter, his grandfather was a hunter and he hoped his youngest son would follow in his footsteps one day. Holko had found a skull of a musk ox the previous day and gave it to Danielsen, who was elated. I asked Danielsen if I could photograph him holding the skull and he happily obliged.\nLater over dinner, we talked. \"Look at these photos,\" Danielsen said smiling, as he showed me his mobile phone. \"This is my father, yesterday.\" His father was standing over a huge polar bear lying dead on the ice. \"And look at these,\" he said with great pride, swiping through photos of three huge adult polar bears that he had killed. Due to warming temperatures over recent decades, polar bears have been forced to change their migration patterns, bringing them closer to communities like Ittoqqortoormiit and posing real dangers to people and themselves.\nFrom Danielsen's hut, we headed 20km east. As our sleds glided over the snow and ice, I marvelled at the scenery and serenity that surrounded me.\nThe light was magical; misty and moody with soft rays of sun caressing the blue-toned pack ice. We passed towering icebergs and eruptions of compacted ice that nature had sculpted into works of art. This was a landscape photographer's paradise. Being in complete darkness at night with no light pollution, the Northern Lights regularly dance through the skies on clear nights in autumn and winter. Even this phenomenon, known locally as arsarnerit (\"those who play ball\") has a connection to hunting, as the lights are believed to be the souls of children playing with a walrus skull.\nAfter five long days of travel, we arrived at Kap Hope, a small settlement of about 20 old huts 14km west of Ittoqqortoormiit with views of ice pack for miles. Exhausted and bitterly cold, the six of us unfurled sleeping bags in one of the cabins. The following morning, as he peered out of a small window with binoculars, Danielsen suddenly shouted, \"Polar bear! Polar bear!\" and pointed into the distance.\nMore like this: • The US West Coast's 'greatest footpath' • The hidden wonders of Mexico's sacred underwater world • The Middle East's once-inaccessible ancient wonder\nMy adrenaline was pumping as I thought about photographing the largest land-based carnivore on Earth – an apex predator that can smell its prey 32km away. We made our way down the side of the mountain, carefully carrying our cameras and longest lenses in heavy winter gear. The bear, 6km away, remained on the ice for 20 minutes or so before sauntering away. I had dreamed about photographing what Holko describes as the \"ghosts of the Arctic\" – polar bears whose white fur blends in so perfectly with its surroundings that they're barely visible – but this was the closest I'd come.\nThere is only one guesthouse in the western hemisphere's most remote community, and it's fittingly named Guesthouse. We were due to rest here for the next three days before flying out, and after nearly a week in the frozen wilderness, it took some time to get used to Ittoqqortoormiit. Brightly painted houses standing in deep white snow dominated the landscapes. Teams of dogs were chained to empty sleds like an Arctic taxi rank. Snowmobiles zipped around town as people went about their daily lives.\nIn recent years, Ittoqqortoormiit has been billing itself as a destination for adventurers – a place where you can cut through the ice on a boat, trek through the tundra, view icebergs and explore a part of the world that few people on the planet will ever see. But as a policeman (one of three, I was told) waved to me as he passed on his snowmobile, I no longer felt like an adventurer, but a small part of this far-flung community.\nYou can walk across Ittoqqortoormiit in about 30 minutes. It's comprised of a church, a small travel agency, a police station, a bar, a guesthouse, a heliport and a small supermarket called Pilersuisoq that's supplied by two ship deliveries each season. Wandering the sparsely stocked aisles, I was struck by the high cost of everything. I wondered how, in a place where there were few jobs, locals could afford these prices.\nOutside, the polar bear skins hanging on scaffolding near so many houses reminded me of this community's origins. I'd embarked on this adventure to capture unique images of wildlife. And while the \"ghosts of the Arctic\" eluded me on this occasion, it didn't matter, as I'd gained a far greater appreciation for how people managed to live in one of the remotest places on Earth.\nKevin Hall is a photographer based in England.

Polar bear!\" and pointed into the distance.\nMore like this: • The US West Coast's 'greatest footpath' • The hidden wonders of Mexico's sacred underwater world • The Middle East's once-inaccessible ancient wonder\nMy adrenaline was pumping as I thought about photographing the largest land-based carnivore on Earth – an apex predator that can smell its prey 32km away. We made our way down the side of the mountain, carefully carrying our cameras and longest lenses in heavy winter gear. The bear, 6km away, remained on the ice for 20 minutes or so before sauntering away. I had dreamed about photographing what Holko describes as the \"ghosts of the Arctic\" – polar bears whose white fur blends in so perfectly with its surroundings that they're barely visible – but this was the closest I'd come.\nThere is only one guesthouse in the western hemisphere's most remote community, and it's fittingly named Guesthouse. We were due to rest here for the next three days before flying out, and after nearly a week in the frozen wilderness, it took some time to get used to Ittoqqortoormiit. Brightly painted houses standing in deep white snow dominated the landscapes. Teams of dogs were chained to empty sleds like an Arctic taxi rank. Snowmobiles zipped around town as people went about their daily lives.\nIn recent years, Ittoqqortoormiit has been billing itself as a destination for adventurers – a place where you can cut through the ice on a boat, trek through the tundra, view icebergs and explore a part of the world that few people on the planet will ever see. But as a policeman (one of three, I was told) waved to me as he passed on his snowmobile, I no longer felt like an adventurer, but a small part of this far-flung community.\nYou can walk across Ittoqqortoormiit in about 30 minutes. It's comprised of a church, a small travel agency, a police station, a bar, a guesthouse, a heliport and a small supermarket called Pilersuisoq that's supplied by two ship deliveries each season. Wandering the sparsely stocked aisles, I was struck by the high cost of everything. I wondered how, in a place where there were few jobs, locals could afford these prices.\nOutside, the polar bear skins hanging on scaffolding near so many houses reminded me of this community's origins. I'd embarked on this adventure to capture unique images of wildlife. And while the \"ghosts of the Arctic\" eluded me on this occasion, it didn't matter, as I'd gained a far greater appreciation for how people managed to live in one of the remotest places on Earth.\nKevin Hall is a photographer based in England.

{"doc_id": 78, "question": "What is the length of the East Royal Road in Cambodia?", "answer": ["100km"], "doc": "Filled with ancient bridges, little-known temples and plenty of off-road adventure, Cambodia's East Royal Road reveals a unique side of the illustrious Khmer Empire.\nI set off in a minivan the morning of my birthday and ended up on the back of a dirt bike clutching a Cambodian man I'd never met before.\nAt 07:00, I had alighted from the wrought iron lift at Raffles Grand Hotel d'Angkor Siem Riep, much as I imagined Jackie Kennedy had done during her visit here in 1967, and met my guide, Pheakdey \"Dey\" Sieng from the tour operator About Asia. I'd come to Siem Reap to explore the East Royal Road, a 100km route that links the ancient temples of Angkor Wat, Beng Mealea and Preah Khan Kompong Svay. The Khmer Empire, which ruled much of Southeast Asia from 802-1431 CE, is famed for its temples, but much of its power came from the 3,000km road system stretching from its historical capital, Angkor, to the far reaches of its realm in modern-day Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar.\nWhile there were five royal roads that linked the capital with its provincial cities, the East Royal Road not only has the largest collection of intact Khmer infrastructure (including bridges, ponds, walls and embankments), but also resthouse temples that aren't found on other roads where pilgrims could eat, pray and sleep. The road was also used to transport the stones used to build the Khmer temples and the iron that was made into weaponry to defend them. The Khmer were known for their sophisticated irrigation systems, and the road is lined with ancient laterite bridges – most of which are still in use – that cross over rivers and streams.\nThe route is considered a classic road trip for dirt bikers and temple enthusiasts alike, and just before I arrived, Prime Minister Hun Manet nominated Beng Mealea and Preah Khan for inclusion as Unesco World Heritage sites. With interest in these sites expected to grow in the coming years, I wanted to see them while they were still under the radar.\nThere was only one problem: the heat was searing. Travellers are advised against coming to Siem Reap in April as it's hotter than Hades, and this particular week, there was a heatwave with temperatures reaching topping 40C, with a UV index of 12 on a scale of 1-11+.\nDey's plan was to visit Preah Khan first and then continue to Beng Mealea before returning to Siem Reap, leaving Angkor for another day. Departing Siem Reap on the ancient earthen road (now largely tracing the paved Highway 6), our first stop, Kampong Kdei, was an 86m bridge supported by 21 arches built during the 12th-Century reign of Jayavarman VII, the greatest and most ambitious Khmer ruler. The rust-coloured bridge, which graces Cambodia's 5,000 Riel banknote, has striking balustrades in the form of a nine-headed naga: the mythical half-human, half-serpent representing water and fertility that's popular in Khmer artwork.\n\"Welcome to free massage road,\" Dey said, as we turned onto a bumpy, dirt path. I wondered what kind of massages he gets, since I felt like I was being dropped repeatedly from a second-floor window. Still an hour from Preah Khan and now off the highway, a more bucolic view of Cambodia emerged. Cement homes were replaced by wooden houses on stilts. A baby calf and her mother ambled across the dusty road and naked toddlers took a break from roughhousing to smile and wave. According to Dey, the villagers are primarily farmers who grow cashews, cassava and rice.\nBones thoroughly rattled, we arrived at Preah Khan. Unlike Angkor Wat which welcomes thousands of visitors a day, few travellers make it to Preah Khan, and as a fellow tourist and I smiled at each other in passing, it felt as if we were in on a secret.\nDey explained that this was the empire's most looted temple, having been plundered by French explorers in the 19th Century and locals in the 20th. In places, the temple looked like a giant game of Jenga, but it was also a menagerie filled with carved three-headed stone swans, garudas (divine birds), elephants and nagas. We stopped at the restored 9.5m-high statue, Preah Chahtomukh, carved with four smiling Buddhas facing each cardinal direction. The sublime sight of the serene, enigmatic faces carved into massive stone towers awed me, and I could see why fellow travellers call them \"the Mona Lisas of Southeast Asia\".\nMore like this:• The Overseas Highway: The US' 'floating' highway• A road trip through the roof of the Americas• The road that's the 'Eighth World Wonder'\nLunch was a delicious meal of rice and dried fish in a thatched hut at a local restaurant. \"This stretch would be better on a dirt bike,\" Dey said, before explaining that the road from Preah Khan to the village of Khvav can only be navigated by off-road motorcycles and oxcarts. Fortunately, he just happened to know two men who'd be happy to take us. I thought of \"the birthday effect\", which says that, statistically speaking, your risk of dying is higher on or near your birthday. Riding on the back of a dirt bike along a dusty path rutted by oxcarts in sweltering weather probably wouldn't help my odds.\nMy dirt bike driver, Mr Cheat, looked concerned as I clambered onto the back of his bike and clenched the grab rail. Dey, who'd been quite serious, broke into a mischievous grin. The engine sputtered and we were off. Careening through the jungle, we dodged trenches and low-hanging tree boughs. We whizzed with exhilaration past forests, fields and the occasional tractor on tightly packed clay pathways before stopping on the side of the road to wander rarely seen ruins.\nThe road from Preah Khan to Beng Mealea is lined with rest stops called \"firehouses\" and the slightly larger resthouse temples. Historians disagree on whether either of these stopping places were religious, secular or both, and because of their inaccessibility, little research has been done on them to date.\nWe stopped at Sopheap Tbong which mirrors the design of all resthouses: an outer wall with a large gate leading to a central hallway flanked by two galleries. Peering through askew windows into a narrow room, I imagined ancient travellers and pilgrims seeking reprieve from their long journeys through the vast Khmer Empire. Since it was believed that the average Khmer traveller could cover 30km per day, these resthouses were placed 15km apart to allow for mid-day and evening stops. \nPrasat Pram, another resthouse, is mostly an array of vine-strangled rocks, but a detached window revealed the carved pillars that served as Khmer window blinds. While I cursed the temperature, I was grateful that the roads were dry, as navigating through wet oxcart ruts would have been treacherous. Before we drove off, I asked Dey why we hadn't seen any oxcarts. He replied, \"It's too hot for the ox.\"\nBack on the bike, I gripped Mr Cheat's shoulders. \"One more temple\", Dey said. Twenty minutes later, I was lumbering over the fallen laterite blocks of the ruined fire shrine, Prasat Ta En, before pausing to take a breath. This was a reststop after all. Leaves rustled and I inhaled the herbaceous fragrance of the trees as the sun peeked through the forest canopy. Without intervention, this site will fade from memory. Except for a few jutting pieces of stone, nature's reclamation was nearly complete.\nWe then drove to our final bridge, Spean Ta Ong, which offered a welcome respite from the rutted roads. At more than 70m long, the ornately carved bridge is as impressive as it is beautiful, especially with its naga balustrades glowing burnt sienna in the late afternoon light.\nPulling into Khvav, my 30km dirt bike adventure ended. I bid Mr Cheat farewell and climbed back into my air-conditioned chariot with Dey. We were 20km from Bang Mealea, which closed in 15 minutes. We pulled up late, but after Dey slipped $5 to a guide enjoying an after-hours beer, we entered Beng Mealea and had it all to ourselves. \nConstructed at the same time as Angkor Wat, many believe Beng Mealea was a prototype for the capitol. The temple is mysterious, romantic and virtually untouched. Silk cotton trees entwine the stone ruins, their roots splaying across the ground like the greedy claws of a giant lizard, while menacing strangler figs look like they're trying to burrow into the earth to reclaim their rightful place in the underworld.\nLittered about the grounds are large piles of sandstone blocks, many decorated with intricate carvings. We followed winding wooden walkways through the ruins (which, it turns out, were built for the set of the 2004 film Two Brothers, starring Guy Pierce). Amidst the rubble on a wall, there was a moss-covered masterpiece: the Churning of the Ocean of Milk, a scene from a Hindu legend depicting a tug-of-war between gods and demons for the elixir of immortality.After an hour, we were back in Siem Reap and stopped by the offices of About Asia where, in my mud-spattered state, I chatted with Silen Truy, one of Siem Reap’s few female guides. When I asked her why she wasn't my guide, she laughed and said, \"The dirt bike. That's man stuff.\"\nI returned to Raffles looking more like Bear Grylls than Jackie Kennedy.

{"doc_id": 79, "question": "What is the name of the rapid that had re-emerged by 2023 and was described as having a boulder the size of a small bus?", "answer": ["Gypsum Rapid"], "doc": "Imagine running rapids that haven't been seen in six decades and camping on beaches that didn't exist a mere few months earlier. Welcome to Cataract Canyon.\nThe muddy current of the Colorado River carries our rafts through the red rock walls of Cataract Canyon in southern Utah's Canyonlands National Park. The roar of a rapid grows louder somewhere downstream. Before we reach the tumultuous churn, the rafts pull up to a small white-sand beach. Beyond, the towering walls pull back to make room for a wide drainage, called a side canyon, where Gypsum Creek trundles in to the meet the river.

{"doc_id": 80, "question": "What is the ancient name of Kea?", "answer": ["Hydroussa"], "doc": "For generations, this teardrop-shaped isle has been known as a cool summer escape for Greek families from the mainland.\nThis summer, as Greece endured deadly heatwaves, tourists and locals alike have been looking for relief. Yet, one Cycladic island has long been known as something of a breezy oasis where mainlanders have long fled to escape the scorching Greek heat: the teardrop-shape isle of Kea, or \"Tzia\" as it's called by locals.\nAs the nearest Cycladic island to the mainland and a one-hour ferry ride from Athens, Kea was known as Hydroussa (roughly: \"water island\") in ancient Greek mythology thanks to its abundant springs that feed its lush vegetation. Today, the 2,500-person island is home to a collection of sleepy villages and hamlets, interspersed with the second homes of affluent Athenians who come to splash in Kea's crystal-clear water and marvel at its renowned sunsets.\n\"Kea used to be, and still is, a weekend haven for Athenians, who would leave their offices on Friday afternoon and arrive effortlessly on the island,\" explained local guide Sotiria Antonopoulou. \"The routine was simple yet fulfilling: a refreshing swim at Gialiskari beach followed by a leisurely dinner at Aristos in Vourkari. On Sunday afternoon, they would take the ferry back to Athens. This ritual, cherished for its simplicity, will be repeated next weekend. It's a place that calls you back. \nStepping off the ferry at the island's main port, Korissia (also known as Livadi), visitors may soon notice that Kea feels quite different than Athens – and there's a reason why.\n\"During summer, the Aegean islands – and especially the Cycladic islands – experience lower maximum temperature than the mainland,\" explained Dr Kostas Lagouvardos, research director at the National Observatory of Athens. \"The strong northern seasonal winds, called Etesians or meltemia, help to maintain air temperature in the islands at cooler conditions than in mainland Greece. For example, during the long-lasting heatwave of July 2024, when temperature exceeded 40C in many Greek areas, temperature in the islands remained well below 35C.\"\nKea's rugged, mountainous interior funnels these winds through its narrow valleys, creating something of a natural ventilation system. The island is also home to the Cyclades' largest oak forest that creates a shady oasis within these cooler islands.  \nBut it isn't just the island's geography and topography that set it apart. Kea's history dates to the Cycladic era (3200BC and 1050BC) and this small, 130 sq km island was once carved into four city-states – the most notable being Karthea, which thrived from the Archaic period (8th Century BC) until the early Byzantine period (6th Century AD). To understand the island's roots, lace up your hiking boots, head to the hamlet of Stavroudháki and follow a paved path up into the mountains, where you can gaze down on the island's dense oak forest and continue towards the remnants of two temples: the Doric temple of Athena and the Temple of Pythion Apollo, which both date to the 6th Century BC.\nAlong the north-eastern part of the island (near the village of Agia Irini) archaeologists have unearthed houses and workshops dating to the late Neolithic Age (around 3300BC), offering a glimpse of early Cycladic life. The most notable finds are the unique \"spouted pots\" and \"Cycladic figurines'' – small clay sculptures with distinctive features, particularly the \"bell-shaped\" skirts – which can now be found at the Archaeological Museum of Kea. Located in Ioulida, the island's ancient (and current) capital, the museum houses a comprehensive collection of ancient artefacts from the island's past, spanning from the Neolithic period to the Roman era.\nOne of the best ways to explore Kea is on foot. Eighty-one kilometres of stone-paved footpaths that once connected Kea's ancient city-states now thread the island.\nOne such hike is into the mountainous capital village of Ioulida, where you'll find the remains of a Venetian castle and the stone-carved Lion of Ioulida, which dates to 600BC and is rumoured to have been built by the same architect who designed Athens' famous Acropolis. In Ioulida, whitewashed walls and a mixed palette of orange, reds and blues colour the village amongst the tiny sinuous pathways, all of which are pedestrianised. In the centre of the square, hikers can recharge in a cluster of tavernas, an ice cream shop and a small grocer that has been in the same family for more than 40 years.\nMore like this:• Gavdos: The European island known for nudity• What to know about the 'beach towel revolt' taking back Greek beaches• One reason many Ikarians live to be 100\nIoulida is surrounded by a series of traditional agricultural terraces supported by hand-built stone walls, which keep the sloping land structurally stable while also allowing the soil to remain in optimal condition for cultivation throughout the seasons. These terraces wrap around the island's many valleys and hills and are home to olive orchards, herb gardens and arable land used by grazing goats and mules. When damaged, they are repaired again, continuing this tradition for the future.\nWhile not entirely isolated, Kea leverages its natural resources and traditional agricultural practices to achieve a remarkable degree of self-sufficiency. Visitors can taste this in the island's renowned honey, pollinated exclusively from the nectar of thyme flowers. This plant, alongside a diverse collection of herbs including chamomile, sage, lavender, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil and the distinctive thrymbi, abound on Kea, emitting a natural perfume for hikers as they explore the hinterlands.\nLocated in Kea's central and eastern interior, the island's ancient oak forest doesn't just keep it cool, but has traditionally been a driving force behind Kea's economy. The caps of the acorns have long been prized for their tannins, and for centuries, islanders have used them in the production of vegetable leather tanning (a more durable and eco-friendly alternative than tanning using animal skins). These forests also help to prevent soil erosion and contribute to rainwater retention.\nHead down the winding and inevitably narrow roads to the coast and you'll reach Kea's famously clear water. The island is renowned for its secluded beaches – namely Gialiskari, Kambi and Koundouros, which remain the most popular spots for locals and day-tripping visitors. \nInterestingly, one of Kea's main draws isn't actually on Kea, but below the ocean, as a wealth of shipwrecks are scattered across the nearby seabed. The Kea Underwater Historic Site marine park is home to three historic shipwrecks that have been fully accessible to divers since 2022. The most famous is the HMHS Britannic (the sister ship of the RMS Titanic), which sank off Kea's coast in 1916 after striking a German naval mine. Add in an offshore reef, numerous underwater caves and a variety of scuba outfitters and Kea is emerging as one of the best diving scuba diving destinations in the Mediterranean.\nAnd when you finally do come up for air in Kea, chances are it'll be to a pleasant, cool breeze.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

It's a place that calls you back. \nStepping off the ferry at the island's main port, Korissia (also known as Livadi), visitors may soon notice that Kea feels quite different than Athens – and there's a reason why.\n\"During summer, the Aegean islands – and especially the Cycladic islands – experience lower maximum temperature than the mainland,\" explained Dr Kostas Lagouvardos, research director at the National Observatory of Athens. \"The strong northern seasonal winds, called Etesians or meltemia, help to maintain air temperature in the islands at cooler conditions than in mainland Greece. For example, during the long-lasting heatwave of July 2024, when temperature exceeded 40C in many Greek areas, temperature in the islands remained well below 35C.\"\nKea's rugged, mountainous interior funnels these winds through its narrow valleys, creating something of a natural ventilation system. The island is also home to the Cyclades' largest oak forest that creates a shady oasis within these cooler islands.  \nBut it isn't just the island's geography and topography that set it apart. Kea's history dates to the Cycladic era (3200BC and 1050BC) and this small, 130 sq km island was once carved into four city-states – the most notable being Karthea, which thrived from the Archaic period (8th Century BC) until the early Byzantine period (6th Century AD). To understand the island's roots, lace up your hiking boots, head to the hamlet of Stavroudháki and follow a paved path up into the mountains, where you can gaze down on the island's dense oak forest and continue towards the remnants of two temples: the Doric temple of Athena and the Temple of Pythion Apollo, which both date to the 6th Century BC.\nAlong the north-eastern part of the island (near the village of Agia Irini) archaeologists have unearthed houses and workshops dating to the late Neolithic Age (around 3300BC), offering a glimpse of early Cycladic life. The most notable finds are the unique \"spouted pots\" and \"Cycladic figurines'' – small clay sculptures with distinctive features, particularly the \"bell-shaped\" skirts – which can now be found at the Archaeological Museum of Kea. Located in Ioulida, the island's ancient (and current) capital, the museum houses a comprehensive collection of ancient artefacts from the island's past, spanning from the Neolithic period to the Roman era.\nOne of the best ways to explore Kea is on foot. Eighty-one kilometres of stone-paved footpaths that once connected Kea's ancient city-states now thread the island.\nOne such hike is into the mountainous capital village of Ioulida, where you'll find the remains of a Venetian castle and the stone-carved Lion of Ioulida, which dates to 600BC and is rumoured to have been built by the same architect who designed Athens' famous Acropolis. In Ioulida, whitewashed walls and a mixed palette of orange, reds and blues colour the village amongst the tiny sinuous pathways, all of which are pedestrianised. In the centre of the square, hikers can recharge in a cluster of tavernas, an ice cream shop and a small grocer that has been in the same family for more than 40 years.\nMore like this:• Gavdos: The European island known for nudity• What to know about the 'beach towel revolt' taking back Greek beaches• One reason many Ikarians live to be 100\nIoulida is surrounded by a series of traditional agricultural terraces supported by hand-built stone walls, which keep the sloping land structurally stable while also allowing the soil to remain in optimal condition for cultivation throughout the seasons. These terraces wrap around the island's many valleys and hills and are home to olive orchards, herb gardens and arable land used by grazing goats and mules. When damaged, they are repaired again, continuing this tradition for the future.\nWhile not entirely isolated, Kea leverages its natural resources and traditional agricultural practices to achieve a remarkable degree of self-sufficiency. Visitors can taste this in the island's renowned honey, pollinated exclusively from the nectar of thyme flowers. This plant, alongside a diverse collection of herbs including chamomile, sage, lavender, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil and the distinctive thrymbi, abound on Kea, emitting a natural perfume for hikers as they explore the hinterlands.\nLocated in Kea's central and eastern interior, the island's ancient oak forest doesn't just keep it cool, but has traditionally been a driving force behind Kea's economy. The caps of the acorns have long been prized for their tannins, and for centuries, islanders have used them in the production of vegetable leather tanning (a more durable and eco-friendly alternative than tanning using animal skins). These forests also help to prevent soil erosion and contribute to rainwater retention.\nHead down the winding and inevitably narrow roads to the coast and you'll reach Kea's famously clear water. The island is renowned for its secluded beaches – namely Gialiskari, Kambi and Koundouros, which remain the most popular spots for locals and day-tripping visitors. \nInterestingly, one of Kea's main draws isn't actually on Kea, but below the ocean, as a wealth of shipwrecks are scattered across the nearby seabed. The Kea Underwater Historic Site marine park is home to three historic shipwrecks that have been fully accessible to divers since 2022. The most famous is the HMHS Britannic (the sister ship of the RMS Titanic), which sank off Kea's coast in 1916 after striking a German naval mine. Add in an offshore reef, numerous underwater caves and a variety of scuba outfitters and Kea is emerging as one of the best diving scuba diving destinations in the Mediterranean.\nAnd when you finally do come up for air in Kea, chances are it'll be to a pleasant, cool breeze.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}
{"doc_id": 82, "question": "What is the length of the Walserweg Gottardo long-distance hiking trail?", "answer": ["210km"], "doc": "Crossing the High Alps through Switzerland and Italy, this 210km hiking route unravels some of the region's most intriguing human history.\nAs I stopped to rest, the deep tolling of cow bells echoed across Alpine meadows bright with the blooms of wildflowers. I took in a lungful of fresh mountain air, half-wondering how on earth the Walser people managed to walk this same steep trail with their livestock and worldly possessions, and pushed further along the ancient mule track that led up and out of the Binna Valley beyond the tiny hamlet of Fald.\nI was in Switzerland to tackle the first stages of the newly inaugurated 210km Walserweg Gottardo long-distance hiking trail, which officially opened in May 2024. While the natural beauty of the trail is enough to attract hikers from across the world, the route has a deeper purpose. It seeks to unravel some of the region's most intriguing human history: the little-known story of the Walser, who migrated through the Alps from Valais to Grisons for still unknown reasons during the 12th to the 14th Centuries.\nPredominantly shepherds, cattle breeders and subsistence farmers, the Walser have long been an under-appreciated part of Swiss culture. They are indigenous to the Canton of Valais in south-western Switzerland, but now mostly live at altitudes just below the High Alps, so-named because their extreme height makes permanent human habitation impossible.\nThe High Alps have traditionally not been celebrated but feared. The Romans, known for their military might and impressive engineering feats, called the area terra maledicta or \"cursed earth\". Nevertheless, the zone immediately below the High Alps is exactly where the Walser migrated, founding small settlements further and further east on multiple occasions over many generations.\nWhat makes the Walser's ancient decision to migrate eastward so interesting is that the reasons behind their migrations, or Walserwanderungen, remain uncertain, even to the Walser themselves. Both overpopulation of the Upper Valais and forced migration by feudal landlords have been suggested.\n\"When I was in primary school [in the 1960s], they told us it was because the people had been hungry and went somewhere else where nobody lived so they were able to stay there,\" Andreas Weissen, a local guidebook author told me. \"Historians now say it was a programme of settlement [of previously uninhabited land].\"\nToday there are a few thousand Walser, inhabiting around 150 individual villages mostly situated along the new trail's route and maintaining a distinct culture and language. They speak a dialect of German largely unintelligible to Standard German speakers and live in small communities of traditional vernacular wooden \"Walserhaus\" homes in the remote mountains. Sometimes called \"colonies\", these settlements reach all the way to Grisons, Switzerland's easternmost canton, and as far north as Lichtenstein.\nDespite their geographic spread, the Walser are aware their smallholder culture, developed through necessity due to their historic isolation, is at risk of disappearing. Many of their characteristics and traditions are intangible in nature. The Walser can't be distinguished by their citizenship, dress, physical appearance or religious faith, meaning traditions are lost when Walser move from the Alps in search of employment or marry into non-Walser families.\n\"It's just the strength to be who we are, to be different, to fight against the weather, the cold, and even be happy about it,\" said Karin Tomamichel of the Walserhaus Museum, when I asked her what defines them as a people.\nThe new trail, created with the full support of Walser communities, is a way of keeping the culture alive by sharing their story with a wider number of people, even as Walser populations in settlements decline.  \nThe route starts in Valais and follows their historic migration route, linking a variety of sights and locations that help reveal the Walser's history and culture, including villages, restaurants/bistros serving up hearty Walser cuisine and the Walserhaus Museum in the town of Bosco Gurin.\nI'd decided to tackle the trail's first five stages, which saw me cover 67km of the trail, from the Walser's ancestral home of the village of Binn in Valais, where some Walser still live amid narrow, car-free paths that lead between chalet-style blockbau homes, recognisable by stacks of horizontal logs interconnected at the corners atop a stone cellar.\nToday, Valais is known for its French-speaking majority, and while there are few physical reminders of the Walser in the canton, the historical connections can be seen in other ways. For instance, \"Walser\" is a contraction of the word \"Walliser\", meaning \"inhabitant of Valais\" in the Walser German dialect of Walsertitsch, hinting at more complex linguistic and cultural origins in the canton.\nFrom Binn, the trail makes use of the lowest pass through the mountains, the desolate 2,409m-high Albrunpass. To reach it, just as the Walser did centuries ago, I climbed steadily on ancient here-and-gone-again tracks and through pasture studded with hidden marmot burrows into larch forest spongy underfoot from endless seasons of fallen needles.\nDuring the 20km, seven-hour ascent, I encountered only a handful of other walkers and no more than a smattering of isolated homes. Snow continued to lie knee-deep in gullies just beside the marked route and the silence of the surroundings was only broken by the occasional few bars of birdsong until I reached the relative energy of Italy's Val Formazza, the location of the first Walser settlements south of the Alps.\nThrough their ongoing migrations, the Walser were the first to inhabit the region permanently, turning hunting areas and summer pasture into year-round settlements formed primary of smallholdings. Its arguably the region's continued isolation – the Val Formazza's village of Crampiolo still can't be reached by road and can be cut off for months over winter due to heavy snowfall – that has helped Walser culture to survive for so long.\nDespite being socially conservative at heart, their migrations resulted in freedoms almost revolutionary for the period. In exchange for permanently settling the upper slopes, the Walser were able to obtain several new customary rights from landowners that most societies lacked. Called Walserrecht, they included full liberty from feudalism, the entitlement to pass inheritance on to heirs and the establishment of \"mayors\" elected by their communities to enforce law and order, something usually done by landlords elsewhere in Switzerland at that time. Their migrations also led to inventions such as the Rittbrätt, a forerunner of the snowboard.\nTypical of the small Walser settlements I passed through was Riale, known in Walsertitsch as Chärbach. Here, I counted no more than a dozen buildings and a hilltop chapel wedded to the flat ground of the River Toce's narrow floodplain and hemmed in by peaks still capped with snow. Each was a solidly built blockbau construction with a roof of heavy roughhewn tiles shaped from local gneiss rock.\nRiale had an almost-abandoned air so early in the hiking season, with just a couple of dog walkers and a single parked car. Even so, its two small guesthouses advertised menus packed with calorie-laden Walser specialities for energy-expending smallholders, such as Bettelmatt (a type of hard cow's milk cheese), gnocchi Walser (potato gnocchi with bacon) and Prata Hapfla (potato pancakes). It was hard to find businesses that weren't keeping Walser culture alive.\nIt was equally hard to conceive of there being any route out of valley over the mountains, given that I was hemmed in on either side with slopes seemingly too steep to tackle. Yet as early as the 13th Century, the Walser did just that, crossing the Alps to the east of Val Formazza via the Hendar Furggu Pass to found Bosco Gurin.\nTheir migration to the only German-speaking settlement in Switzerland's Italian-majority canton of Ticino, is echoed by stage five of the Walserweg Gottardo.\nTo counter the precipitous inclines, the stage had me zigzagging from Val Formazza through shady larch forest. The trees opened out into Alpine pasture and onto the shores of Lake Superiore, reflecting nearby peaks in its still waters and sending a glacial chill through the air. Bosco Gurin's Walserhaus ethnographic museum, housed in one of the oldest surviving structures in the Alps, dating to 1386, came into view several hours of uninterrupted walking later.\nMore like this:• A new chance to hike Europe's ancient salt route• An award-winning 1,400km hike into the wilds of Eastern Europe• France's centuries-old mountain farm stays\nWaiting for me as I tackled the last steps of the stage along flagstones forming the village's pedestrian-only paths, polished with generations of wear, were Tomamichel and the Walserhaus's curator, Cristina Lessman Della Pietra, both of whom come from Walser families.\nSpeaking with passion, their pride in their unique cultural heritage was obvious, but they were also very aware that it's at risk of vanishing. The reason the museum was founded was to \"assure Walser history by gathering everything in one place\", Lessman Della Pietra said. Founded in 1938 by an association of Walser people, its rooms are packed with everyday articles that are now anything but every day, from hand-carved cradles to an antique loom still used by a colleague of Tomamichel and Lessman Della Pietra to make cloth.\nFor many, it's the language that defines the Walser, given the limited intelligibility between Walsertitsch, Swiss German speakers and Standard German speakers due to hundreds of years of the Walser's isolated living. \"The language is an aspect that is going to disappear,\" warned Tomamichel. \"She [Cristina] speaks it but I don't even if I grew up here because my mum was from Ticino, from another village where they spoke Italian.\"\nCompounding the issue is contemporary migration, as Walser families move away from their traditional settlements to find greater opportunities in larger towns and cities. \"I can imagine that many people, if they have to choose between an easy life and cultural values, they choose the easy life,\" conceded Tomamichel. Where Bosco Gurin was home to 400 permanent residents in the mid-19th Century, today there are 50.\nThe hope is that the creation of the Walserweg Gottardo and the arrival of hikers will help maintain the Walser's culture for years to come by providing new employment opportunities that encourage Walser people to stay. The presence of several young families, including Tomamichel's, gives hope for the future of Walser settlements like Bosco Gurin.\n\"I care about my culture, my roots,\" Tomamichel told me. \"I grew up here and it feels natural to maintain it. The Walserweg Gottardo will help us do that.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

Even so, its two small guesthouses advertised menus packed with calorie-laden Walser specialities for energy-expending smallholders, such as Bettelmatt (a type of hard cow's milk cheese), gnocchi Walser (potato gnocchi with bacon) and Prata Hapfla (potato pancakes). It was hard to find businesses that weren't keeping Walser culture alive.\nIt was equally hard to conceive of there being any route out of valley over the mountains, given that I was hemmed in on either side with slopes seemingly too steep to tackle. Yet as early as the 13th Century, the Walser did just that, crossing the Alps to the east of Val Formazza via the Hendar Furggu Pass to found Bosco Gurin.\nTheir migration to the only German-speaking settlement in Switzerland's Italian-majority canton of Ticino, is echoed by stage five of the Walserweg Gottardo.\nTo counter the precipitous inclines, the stage had me zigzagging from Val Formazza through shady larch forest. The trees opened out into Alpine pasture and onto the shores of Lake Superiore, reflecting nearby peaks in its still waters and sending a glacial chill through the air. Bosco Gurin's Walserhaus ethnographic museum, housed in one of the oldest surviving structures in the Alps, dating to 1386, came into view several hours of uninterrupted walking later.\nMore like this:• A new chance to hike Europe's ancient salt route• An award-winning 1,400km hike into the wilds of Eastern Europe• France's centuries-old mountain farm stays\nWaiting for me as I tackled the last steps of the stage along flagstones forming the village's pedestrian-only paths, polished with generations of wear, were Tomamichel and the Walserhaus's curator, Cristina Lessman Della Pietra, both of whom come from Walser families.\nSpeaking with passion, their pride in their unique cultural heritage was obvious, but they were also very aware that it's at risk of vanishing. The reason the museum was founded was to \"assure Walser history by gathering everything in one place\", Lessman Della Pietra said. Founded in 1938 by an association of Walser people, its rooms are packed with everyday articles that are now anything but every day, from hand-carved cradles to an antique loom still used by a colleague of Tomamichel and Lessman Della Pietra to make cloth.\nFor many, it's the language that defines the Walser, given the limited intelligibility between Walsertitsch, Swiss German speakers and Standard German speakers due to hundreds of years of the Walser's isolated living. \"The language is an aspect that is going to disappear,\" warned Tomamichel. \"She [Cristina] speaks it but I don't even if I grew up here because my mum was from Ticino, from another village where they spoke Italian.\"\nCompounding the issue is contemporary migration, as Walser families move away from their traditional settlements to find greater opportunities in larger towns and cities. \"I can imagine that many people, if they have to choose between an easy life and cultural values, they choose the easy life,\" conceded Tomamichel. Where Bosco Gurin was home to 400 permanent residents in the mid-19th Century, today there are 50.\nThe hope is that the creation of the Walserweg Gottardo and the arrival of hikers will help maintain the Walser's culture for years to come by providing new employment opportunities that encourage Walser people to stay. The presence of several young families, including Tomamichel's, gives hope for the future of Walser settlements like Bosco Gurin.\n\"I care about my culture, my roots,\" Tomamichel told me. \"I grew up here and it feels natural to maintain it. The Walserweg Gottardo will help us do that.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

To help you discover the chicest fashion, homewares and gifts, we asked real-life Parisian \"it girl\" Jeanne Damas, creative director of the fashion brand Rouje, for her picks.\nA lifelong Parisian, Damas is known for embodying \"French-girl\" style with her romantic knits and viral flower-print Gabin wrap dress, found at the multiple locations of her Rouje boutiques. When she's off duty, she channels style inspiration by taking in her surroundings. \"One of my favourite things to do is to sit in one of the typical corner cafes and watch the people passing by,\" she says, citing Café Le Nemours in Place Colette (1st arrondissement) as her people-watching go-to: \"The best fashion show ever.

We're used to seeing Denmark, Finland and Norway leading the pack in the world's happiest country lists – but another European country has been quietly making its case for being one of the best places in the world to live.\nWith multiple cities listed in the top 10 of this year's Global Liveability Index and the Smart City Index, Switzerland shows that its policies offer nationwide impact. Zurich and Geneva cracked the top 10 most liveable cities, with perfect scores in healthcare and education; while Zurich came in as the number one smart city for its chart-topping infrastructure and technology score, with Geneva following close behind in fourth place, followed by Lausanne in seventh.\nAs a smaller country bordered by five other nations, Switzerland has been influenced by various cultures and languages throughout its existence, which has led to positive styles of governance, according to residents. \"One big cultural influence is our history as a 'nation by will', with a lot of minorities (cultural, ethnic, language etc), resulting in a high sensitivity and acceptance of compromises,\" said resident Res Marty, founder of Switzerland Beyond Chocolate. \nThe country famously practices direct democracy where every citizen gets a vote on laws and referendums, which helps residents feel like they have a real voice when it comes to how they live and how their tax dollars are spent. \"In our village, they wanted to extend the school so there was a vote to raise the tax for five years to pay for it,\" said Rosamund Tagel, founder of Glow Concierge, who lives and works in Zürich. \"The vote passed with an overwhelming majority because people understand the importance of education.\" \nWe spoke to residents about how these policies shape Switzerland as a premier place to live, and how they contribute to an overall higher quality and enjoyment of life.\nIn the Global Liveability ranking, both Geneva and Zurich scored a perfect 100 on education – something that residents noted as particular point of pride. \"Public schools are excellent. If I still lived in the UK, I would 100% send my children to private school. But in Switzerland it's just not needed,\" said Tagel. \"It's so international at our local school that my kids speak four languages and that is fairly typical. Every single one of their friends speaks at least two, and most three or four, which is such a massive advantage.\"\nThe classes here aren't just focussed on academic achievement either. Skills for life and work are also taught and graded. \"The curriculum includes social competencies, independence, self-organisation and respectful conduct,\" said Barbara Rose Collins, originally from Sydney, Australia, who lives in Küsnacht, a small lakeside town at the edge of Zurich. \"All of these are separately assessed on school reports and carry equal weighting to academic results during progression decisions.\" \nA strong sense of security and safety across Switzerland means kids walk to and from school as early as age four – perhaps no surprise as the Swiss cities ranked highly in the stability, culture and environment parts of the indexes. Tagel notes that she loves the fact that her kids can run off to play with their friends, knowing they will return safely and \"magically appear\" by sundown. \"Of course there is crime like in any country, but the stats in Switzerland are one of the lowest in the world,\" she said. \"People still leave their doors unlocked outside of the cities when popping out.\"\nAnd popping out they do. Social and family life are prioritised here, which can lead to a slower pace of life. \"When you enter Switzerland, you turn your watch back about 60 years and hit the slo-mo button on your remote,\" said Collins. \"Nobody is in a rush – rushing is considered something done by people who are disorganised. Everyone goes for their daily walks, fixed working hours are practically a religion, no long commutes, few traffic jams, and people take time to sit down to eat and drink with scarce takeaway options.\" \nThis also comes across as a healthy respect for farming and the food supply, with traffic often coming to a halt to let animals walk down the street or allow a tractor to pass. Main streets might be closed during the morning commute for workers to plant seasonal flowers and update roadside landscaping, but that job is viewed just as important as anyone else's role, according to Collins. \nSwitzerland also lucks out thanks to its naturally beautiful landscape that's painted with rivers, lakes and the imposing Alps (covering 60% of the country's whole surface area).  With high scores in culture and environment in the liveability index, Swiss cities' proximity to nature contributes highly to residents' sense of happiness, especially since governmental and cultural norms allow ample time and space to enjoy it. \n\"Switzerland recognises that contact with nature is essential for wellbeing and this concept is factored into planning of cities and living spaces,\" said Collins. \"Forests reach all the way to and into the city and natural rivers and streams run through the city rather than being diverted so everyone can always access nature.\"\nAs one example, a viral TikTok by American DJ Diplo recently pointed to how the residents of Basel commute to work by jumping in the Rhine river and floating downstream – using a floatable bag for their clothes to change into at the end.\nResidents of other cities also bask in the accessibility of the outdoors. \"I often go for a walk along Lake Geneva with a stop in the gardens of the Olympic Museum, and then I continue until the village of Pully, where I relax by the bar La Générale,\" said Olivia Bosshart, a manager at Lausanne Tourism. \"I always have my swimsuit with me as there are several access points and beaches by the lake, not to mention the charming lakeside villages between St-Sulpice and Lutry.\"\nMore like this:• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024• Lausanne: The Swiss city that runs the Olympics• What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024\nMelanie Trummer, a resident of Grindelwald in the Bernese Alps, famous for the imposing Eiger mountain, adds that the benefits of the country's engaged infrastructure even extends outside the major cities. \"Grindelwald offers the advantages of a mountain village and the possibilities of a city,\" she said. \"Good tourist infrastructure and various service providers like cable cars, public transports, hotels, restaurants and businesses ensure that the Eiger village, despite its Alpine location, is an attractive workplace with secure working conditions.\"\nFor travellers in particular, Switzerland offers easy access to the rest of Europe, as well as intercity public transportation with a reliable train system and technology services that make life more convenient. \"The SwissPass card serves as a universal ticket for all public transport and provides access to libraries, museums and municipal facilities,\" said Nausheen Farishta, founder of Globe Gazers, who splits her time between Geneva and northern Italy. \"You can even use it as a digital identity card.\"\nShe also notes that cities across Switzerland are testing self-driving vehicles, a project that is being managed country-wide via the Swiss Association for Autonomous Mobility. The platform aims to lead on the issues of regulation, social acceptance and technology to further help residents more easily access transportation. Thirteen test projects and vehicles have already been completed across cities like Bern and Zurich, with 11 more currently underway. \nResidents consider Switzerland's relatively small size a major strength – with no destination too far or remote. \"Personally, I like how close everything is.

Zurich and Geneva cracked the top 10 most liveable cities, with perfect scores in healthcare and education; while Zurich came in as the number one smart city for its chart-topping infrastructure and technology score, with Geneva following close behind in fourth place, followed by Lausanne in seventh.\nAs a smaller country bordered by five other nations, Switzerland has been influenced by various cultures and languages throughout its existence, which has led to positive styles of governance, according to residents. \"One big cultural influence is our history as a 'nation by will', with a lot of minorities (cultural, ethnic, language etc), resulting in a high sensitivity and acceptance of compromises,\" said resident Res Marty, founder of Switzerland Beyond Chocolate. \nThe country famously practices direct democracy where every citizen gets a vote on laws and referendums, which helps residents feel like they have a real voice when it comes to how they live and how their tax dollars are spent. \"In our village, they wanted to extend the school so there was a vote to raise the tax for five years to pay for it,\" said Rosamund Tagel, founder of Glow Concierge, who lives and works in Zürich. \"The vote passed with an overwhelming majority because people understand the importance of education.\" \nWe spoke to residents about how these policies shape Switzerland as a premier place to live, and how they contribute to an overall higher quality and enjoyment of life.\nIn the Global Liveability ranking, both Geneva and Zurich scored a perfect 100 on education – something that residents noted as particular point of pride. \"Public schools are excellent. If I still lived in the UK, I would 100% send my children to private school. But in Switzerland it's just not needed,\" said Tagel. \"It's so international at our local school that my kids speak four languages and that is fairly typical. Every single one of their friends speaks at least two, and most three or four, which is such a massive advantage.\"\nThe classes here aren't just focussed on academic achievement either. Skills for life and work are also taught and graded. \"The curriculum includes social competencies, independence, self-organisation and respectful conduct,\" said Barbara Rose Collins, originally from Sydney, Australia, who lives in Küsnacht, a small lakeside town at the edge of Zurich. \"All of these are separately assessed on school reports and carry equal weighting to academic results during progression decisions.\" \nA strong sense of security and safety across Switzerland means kids walk to and from school as early as age four – perhaps no surprise as the Swiss cities ranked highly in the stability, culture and environment parts of the indexes. Tagel notes that she loves the fact that her kids can run off to play with their friends, knowing they will return safely and \"magically appear\" by sundown. \"Of course there is crime like in any country, but the stats in Switzerland are one of the lowest in the world,\" she said. \"People still leave their doors unlocked outside of the cities when popping out.\"\nAnd popping out they do. Social and family life are prioritised here, which can lead to a slower pace of life. \"When you enter Switzerland, you turn your watch back about 60 years and hit the slo-mo button on your remote,\" said Collins. \"Nobody is in a rush – rushing is considered something done by people who are disorganised. Everyone goes for their daily walks, fixed working hours are practically a religion, no long commutes, few traffic jams, and people take time to sit down to eat and drink with scarce takeaway options.\" \nThis also comes across as a healthy respect for farming and the food supply, with traffic often coming to a halt to let animals walk down the street or allow a tractor to pass. Main streets might be closed during the morning commute for workers to plant seasonal flowers and update roadside landscaping, but that job is viewed just as important as anyone else's role, according to Collins. \nSwitzerland also lucks out thanks to its naturally beautiful landscape that's painted with rivers, lakes and the imposing Alps (covering 60% of the country's whole surface area).  With high scores in culture and environment in the liveability index, Swiss cities' proximity to nature contributes highly to residents' sense of happiness, especially since governmental and cultural norms allow ample time and space to enjoy it. \n\"Switzerland recognises that contact with nature is essential for wellbeing and this concept is factored into planning of cities and living spaces,\" said Collins. \"Forests reach all the way to and into the city and natural rivers and streams run through the city rather than being diverted so everyone can always access nature.\"\nAs one example, a viral TikTok by American DJ Diplo recently pointed to how the residents of Basel commute to work by jumping in the Rhine river and floating downstream – using a floatable bag for their clothes to change into at the end.\nResidents of other cities also bask in the accessibility of the outdoors. \"I often go for a walk along Lake Geneva with a stop in the gardens of the Olympic Museum, and then I continue until the village of Pully, where I relax by the bar La Générale,\" said Olivia Bosshart, a manager at Lausanne Tourism. \"I always have my swimsuit with me as there are several access points and beaches by the lake, not to mention the charming lakeside villages between St-Sulpice and Lutry.\"\nMore like this:• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024• Lausanne: The Swiss city that runs the Olympics• What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024\nMelanie Trummer, a resident of Grindelwald in the Bernese Alps, famous for the imposing Eiger mountain, adds that the benefits of the country's engaged infrastructure even extends outside the major cities. \"Grindelwald offers the advantages of a mountain village and the possibilities of a city,\" she said. \"Good tourist infrastructure and various service providers like cable cars, public transports, hotels, restaurants and businesses ensure that the Eiger village, despite its Alpine location, is an attractive workplace with secure working conditions.\"\nFor travellers in particular, Switzerland offers easy access to the rest of Europe, as well as intercity public transportation with a reliable train system and technology services that make life more convenient. \"The SwissPass card serves as a universal ticket for all public transport and provides access to libraries, museums and municipal facilities,\" said Nausheen Farishta, founder of Globe Gazers, who splits her time between Geneva and northern Italy. \"You can even use it as a digital identity card.\"\nShe also notes that cities across Switzerland are testing self-driving vehicles, a project that is being managed country-wide via the Swiss Association for Autonomous Mobility. The platform aims to lead on the issues of regulation, social acceptance and technology to further help residents more easily access transportation. Thirteen test projects and vehicles have already been completed across cities like Bern and Zurich, with 11 more currently underway. \nResidents consider Switzerland's relatively small size a major strength – with no destination too far or remote. \"Personally, I like how close everything is. This makes mountain excursions or leisure activities across the entire country very easy,\" said Marty. \"If I want to, I can be on hiking trails in the mountains, in the city centre or on the lake in about 30 minutes.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}

{"doc_id": 87, "question": "What is the name of the chef who has cooked for Emmanuel Macron and Lauryn Hill?", "answer": ["Tolu Erogbogbo"], "doc": "Delicious, nutritious yam is revered by Nigerians worldwide in festivals and cultural rites. But its legacy is evolving; today's Nigerian chefs are cooking it in brand new ways.\nAcross Nigeria and its global diaspora, one crop reigns supreme: the yam. Resembling logs with their cylindrical shape and thick bark-like skins, yams have fuelled Nigerian and wider West African communities for millennia. However, the humble yam is far more than just a nutritional source. Revered at New Yam festivals, central to ancient oral storytelling traditions and a key component of many cultural rites, yam is not only integral to local cuisine; it weaves together the vibrant and intricate tapestry of the country's cultural identity.\nBut yam's legacy is evolving; today's Nigerian chefs worldwide are honouring the root vegetable with traditional and experimental approaches alike. \n\"Yam really is the king of crops!\" said chef Tolu Erogbogbo, when I asked him about his childhood memories of the starchy, ivory-fleshed tuber. Christened with the playful moniker \"the billionaire's chef\" due to his clientele of prominent international figures (including the likes of Emmanuel Macron and Lauryn Hill), Erogbogbo has founded contemporary West African eateries across Nigeria and Los Angeles, but he has never forgotten the familiar, delicious comfort of yam, or its important symbolism. \"On Sundays we'd always have egg sauce, served with lovely soft yam,\" he said, recalling the beloved Nigerian breakfast where scrambled eggs are stewed with tomatoes and sweet red peppers; mixed with salty fresh or tinned fish (or corned beef); and then seasoned with onions, a tricolour of local chillies and dried local spices like the fiery Cameroon pepper.\nThe jiggling heap of scrambled eggs, made juicy by the tomatoes, is perfectly complemented by the mellow sweetness of fluffy boiled yam. But as Erogbogbo explained, the dish, known simply as \"yam and egg sauce\", is not just a weekend treat. \"It's all about ushering in a positive new week,\" he said. \"This is because yam symbolises wealth and prosperity.\"  \nThis important symbolism is why yam tubers can still be found piled high amidst the pomp and pageantry of Nigerian weddings worldwide, where they represent abundance. Yam also represents fertility; Nigeria's high twin birth rate is believed by many locals to be due to high levels of yam consumption. Indeed, yam is a constant presence in Nigerian folktales, such as that of the Ìrókò tree spirit who women beseeched with yams to cure infertility, a story that left me wide-eyed whenever my mother sang it to me as a child before bed. Yam's cultural significance continues in the plethora of allegorical proverbs across Nigerian cultures that are used to pass down cultural norms and wisdom. I won't be the only Ẹ̀gbọ́n (title for older sibling) who was reminded of my responsibilities with the Yorùbá language adage, \"a bachelor who roasts his yam shares it with his sheep\" – one should always look after their own.\nThe veneration of yams is most deeply seen and felt at Nigeria's annual yam festivals. Between June and October, as the rainy season ebbs, many of Nigeria's several hundred ethnic groups commemorate the harvest of new yams. From Leboku, the multi-week extravaganza held by the Yakurr people of Cross River State, to Odun Ijesu among the Yorùbás of Ikere-Ekiti in south-western Nigeria, most festivities involve frenetic masquerades, thunderous choruses of prayer, kaleidoscopic parades and plenty of synchronised dance and drumming.\nThese performances honour agricultural and fertility deities, but some rites have evolved to incorporate Christian worship in the wake of colonialism and globalisation. While there are many parallels between the celebrations, region-specific nuances set the festivals apart. For instance, in the town of Ogidi, Kogi State, you'll find Yorùbá bata dancers decked in indigo-dyed àdìrẹ garments and traditional female drummers singing oríkì (praise poetry), their bodies wrapped in a rainbow of handwoven aṣọ òkè cloth.\nA particularly prominent New Yam Festival is Iri Ji (Igbo for \"new yam eating\"). To ward off misfortune, all yams from the previous harvest must be consumed before tucking into the new bounty. Iri Ji is not only celebrated in Igboland (Southeastern Nigeria); from America to Poland, Igbo communities gather in town halls and community centres to commemorate the new harvest. Alongside modern developments such as online streaming and TikTok vlogs of the celebrations, ancient rituals remain, such as enjoying smoky roasted yam with fresh West African palm oil – as red and glossy as stained glass.\nBut as sacred as yam is to Nigerian identity and folklore, the most enduring yam ritual will forever be simply eating it.\n\"Yam is extremely versatile. It can be pounded, boiled, fried, roasted… there are so many ways to enjoy it,\" said restaurateur Aji Akokomi, explaining the inclusion of yams on the ever-changing menu at his restaurant Akoko, a West African fine-dining restaurant in London that was awarded its first Michelin star this year. \"At Akoko, we've made yam croquettes topped with truffles, and we're adding pounded yam with egusi soup and monkfish.\"\nYam dishes are also found at Akara, Akokomi's more casual sibling restaurant. \"There we make yams into this delicious sauce served with barbecued pork and fermented scotch bonnet.\" \nMore like this:• West Africa’s Michelin-starred cuisine wows London• A West African ode to a spicy and tangy chicken dish• Ube: the Filipino tuber taking over the world\nSubtly scented, yam is well-suited to complementing more robust flavours, making it an apt canvas for chefs to showcase creativity and technical flair. For Adenike Adefila, a chef at the first fine-dining pan-African restaurant in Abuja, The Burgundy, yam is the perfect indigenous vessel for applying techniques from her French and Italian culinary training. For instance, she forms yam into pillowy gnocchi served with a rich tomato relish finished with cream. \"We also layer very thinly sliced yam and soak it overnight in whey with cardamom and ehuru (calabash nutmeg),\" she said, explaining the process behind her yam gratin.

His innovations include yam dumplings served with a deconstructed ẹ̀fọ́ riro; aromatic braised greens with chillies and umami-filled fermented locust beans. There's also a twist on the traditional combination of pounded yam and egusi, the nutty, intensely savoury stew made from ground native gourd seeds: a yam mousse with a buttery, mustard-yellow egusi sauce.  \nWhile these reinvented yam dishes put a fresh spin on the vegetable's role in Nigerian cuisine and culture, Yewande Komolafe, author of seminal Nigerian cookbook My Everyday Lagos told me, \"traditional yam dishes are perfect just as they are\". From ofe nsala (white soup), an Eastern Nigerian delicacy thickened with yam, brimming with fresh seafood and sprinkled with ribbons of fresh bitter uziza leaves, to ojojo, crispy and moreish Yorùbá water yam fritters, to ukodo, an Urhobo one-pot-wonder of yam chunks, green plantain and meat simmering in a full-bodied, sinus-clearing broth, time-honoured yam recipes are cherished across Nigeria and beyond.\nBut for now, even with avant-garde recipes and modernised cultural practices, yam remains an unbroken thread connecting generations of Nigerians with their ancestors. \nCrushed Yam Fritters\nBy Yewande Komolafe\nServes 8-10\nCooked yams or a leftover pot of àsáró (yam porridge) can be repurposed as yam fritters to serve as a 'small chop' (Nigerian Pidgin for a snack or appetiser). This recipe is as easy as it gets, made both rich and refreshing by the addition of ata dín dín (bell pepper sauce) and fresh spring onions. The garri (cassava flour)-dusted crust is my recommendation, but you can also use breadcrumbs or panko for this step. Serve warm or at room temperature with extra ata dín dín for dipping.\nFor the ata dín dín (makes 2 cups)\nMethod\nStep 1\nCombine the bell peppers, onion, garlic, ginger and Scotch bonnet pepper in a food processor or blender and pulse to a coarse purée. \nStep 2\nPour the puree into a shallow medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat.\nStep 3\nCover and let simmer until the peppers and onions have softened, and released their liquid, 18 to 20 minutes.\nStep 4\nPour in the oil and cook further, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens and looks separated, about 15 minutes. Season with salt to taste.\n \nMethod\nStep 1\nPrepare two baking sheets by lining one with a sheet of parchment paper and placing a cooling rack inside the other.\nStep 2\nCut the yam into thick 1½-in slices. Remove the brown skin on the slices by peeling off with a paring knife or a vegetable peeler. Put the peeled pieces into a bowl of water to keep them from turning brown.\nStep 3\nRinse off the yam pieces and place in a medium saucepan. Cover with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Season with a dash of salt and reduce heat to a simmer.\nStep 4\nAllow the yam to cook until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain off any remaining liquid and move the yam to a bowl. Mash the yam into a chunky paste with a fork or potato masher and allow to cool completely.\nStep 5\nAdd the ata dín dín, green onions and ginger to the yam paste, stir to incorporate. Season the mix with 1 tsp salt.\nStep 6\nGently whisk 1 egg and fold it into the yam mixture. Scoop the mixture into tablespoon-size balls using an ice cream scoop or a tablespoon measure and place on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate until the scoops are chilled through, at least 1 hour. At this point the scooped balls can also be frozen by placing the baking sheet in the freezer. Once frozen, store the scooped mix in an airtight container or bag for up to 2 weeks.\nStep 7\nPrepare a dredging station using 3 medium-sized containers for the remaining 2 eggs, the cornstarch, and garri or panko. Season each bowl lightly with salt and lightly beat the eggs. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan to 162C or until a drop of water sizzles when sprinkled in. Dip the yam balls in the cornstarch first, then the egg mixture, then coat with the garri, panko or breadcrumbs. Fry the dipped yam balls until golden brown and warm all the way through, 4 to 6 minutes. Turn frequently to ensure an even colour all round.

{"doc_id": 87, "question": "What dish is traditionally served with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, and sweet red peppers in Nigerian cuisine?", "answer": ["Yam and egg sauce"], "doc": "Delicious, nutritious yam is revered by Nigerians worldwide in festivals and cultural rites. But its legacy is evolving; today's Nigerian chefs are cooking it in brand new ways.\nAcross Nigeria and its global diaspora, one crop reigns supreme: the yam. Resembling logs with their cylindrical shape and thick bark-like skins, yams have fuelled Nigerian and wider West African communities for millennia. However, the humble yam is far more than just a nutritional source. Revered at New Yam festivals, central to ancient oral storytelling traditions and a key component of many cultural rites, yam is not only integral to local cuisine; it weaves together the vibrant and intricate tapestry of the country's cultural identity.\nBut yam's legacy is evolving; today's Nigerian chefs worldwide are honouring the root vegetable with traditional and experimental approaches alike. \n\"Yam really is the king of crops!\" said chef Tolu Erogbogbo, when I asked him about his childhood memories of the starchy, ivory-fleshed tuber. Christened with the playful moniker \"the billionaire's chef\" due to his clientele of prominent international figures (including the likes of Emmanuel Macron and Lauryn Hill), Erogbogbo has founded contemporary West African eateries across Nigeria and Los Angeles, but he has never forgotten the familiar, delicious comfort of yam, or its important symbolism. \"On Sundays we'd always have egg sauce, served with lovely soft yam,\" he said, recalling the beloved Nigerian breakfast where scrambled eggs are stewed with tomatoes and sweet red peppers; mixed with salty fresh or tinned fish (or corned beef); and then seasoned with onions, a tricolour of local chillies and dried local spices like the fiery Cameroon pepper.\nThe jiggling heap of scrambled eggs, made juicy by the tomatoes, is perfectly complemented by the mellow sweetness of fluffy boiled yam. But as Erogbogbo explained, the dish, known simply as \"yam and egg sauce\", is not just a weekend treat. \"It's all about ushering in a positive new week,\" he said. \"This is because yam symbolises wealth and prosperity.\"  \nThis important symbolism is why yam tubers can still be found piled high amidst the pomp and pageantry of Nigerian weddings worldwide, where they represent abundance. Yam also represents fertility; Nigeria's high twin birth rate is believed by many locals to be due to high levels of yam consumption. Indeed, yam is a constant presence in Nigerian folktales, such as that of the Ìrókò tree spirit who women beseeched with yams to cure infertility, a story that left me wide-eyed whenever my mother sang it to me as a child before bed. Yam's cultural significance continues in the plethora of allegorical proverbs across Nigerian cultures that are used to pass down cultural norms and wisdom. I won't be the only Ẹ̀gbọ́n (title for older sibling) who was reminded of my responsibilities with the Yorùbá language adage, \"a bachelor who roasts his yam shares it with his sheep\" – one should always look after their own.\nThe veneration of yams is most deeply seen and felt at Nigeria's annual yam festivals. Between June and October, as the rainy season ebbs, many of Nigeria's several hundred ethnic groups commemorate the harvest of new yams. From Leboku, the multi-week extravaganza held by the Yakurr people of Cross River State, to Odun Ijesu among the Yorùbás of Ikere-Ekiti in south-western Nigeria, most festivities involve frenetic masquerades, thunderous choruses of prayer, kaleidoscopic parades and plenty of synchronised dance and drumming.\nThese performances honour agricultural and fertility deities, but some rites have evolved to incorporate Christian worship in the wake of colonialism and globalisation. While there are many parallels between the celebrations, region-specific nuances set the festivals apart. For instance, in the town of Ogidi, Kogi State, you'll find Yorùbá bata dancers decked in indigo-dyed àdìrẹ garments and traditional female drummers singing oríkì (praise poetry), their bodies wrapped in a rainbow of handwoven aṣọ òkè cloth.\nA particularly prominent New Yam Festival is Iri Ji (Igbo for \"new yam eating\"). To ward off misfortune, all yams from the previous harvest must be consumed before tucking into the new bounty. Iri Ji is not only celebrated in Igboland (Southeastern Nigeria); from America to Poland, Igbo communities gather in town halls and community centres to commemorate the new harvest.

{"doc_id": 88, "question": "What is the name of the pizzeria owned by Franco Pepe?", "answer": ["Pepe in Grani"], "doc": "The award-winning pizza maker of Pepe in Grani honed his craft in Naples. Here are his Neapolitan culinary favourites, from Chalet Ciro to Mimì alla Ferrovia.\nItaly's seaside city of Naples is the birthplace of pizza, with proto versions of the tomato and mozzarella-smothered flatbread hitting the cobblestoned streets as early as 1738. But in the 1990s, long before he created what has been voted the world's best pizza, chef Franco Pepe was pounding the city's pavements to learn the great Neapolitan pizza making arts.\n\"I have a wonderful personal relationship with Naples,\" says Pepe, now the eponymous owner of the global sensation Pepe in Grani pizzeria in his hometown of Caiazzo, 50km outside the city; famed for his mastery and innovation. \"My time there was crucial to my pizza making career. Spending time with Neapolitan pizza masters... soaking up the pizza-making culture... witnessing the birth of the disciplinare (the official AVPN regulations defining \"True Neapolitan Pizza\"). That experience helped me develop my own pizza. For me, Naples symbolises my youth.\"\nThough iconic among Italian cities, Naples is often overlooked by overseas tourists in favour of Rome, Florence and Venice. But Pepe loves returning to his old stomping grounds. \"You experience colours, music, and, yes, okay, confusion,\" he admits, alluding to the city's notoriously chaotic traffic and jumbled lasagna layers of Ancient Greco-Roman, Spanish, Norman, Bourbon and Baroque architecture. \"But also, art, history and beauty. Spending a day there is magical.\"\nPepe's favourite way to experience the city is to wade through the graffiti-streaked side streets of its 3,000 year-old centro storico (historic centre) – \"It's vivacious; you see how Neapolitans really live\" – and stroll down the Mergellina seafront, a 2.5km stretch of rocky coastline hugging the Gulf of Naples, facing the humpbacked Mt Vesuvius: \"Like walking through history.\"\nWhen asked for his top Neapolitan dishes, Pepe is quick to note: \"Neapolitan food isn't just pizza; there's an amazing cuisine using products, which I also use on my pizza, that you can't find anywhere else in the world, cultivated in the volcanic soil of Vesuvius. Like the piennolo [tomato], the apricot, the wines… our mozzarella.  The parmigiana di melanzane (aubergine parmigiana); the Neapolitan ragù that simmers for hours.... those are the things you have to eat in Naples.\"\nHere are Pepe's favourite Neapolitan culinary experiences.\nTo get to the heart of Neapolitan cuisine, start with tradizione.

It's traditional, it's clean, the service is great and so is the food.\"\nMimì alla Ferrovia is found on an unassuming block crisscrossed by train tracks in Naples's Unesco-listed centro storico, crowded by mildew-stained buildings and scooters whizzing through razor-narrow cobblestone streets where, without warning, ornate medieval churches spring from corners and Greek ruins appear beneath your feet. The menu abounds with Neapolitan classics like pasta e patate (pasta with potatoes and cheese) and polpette al ragù (meatballs with ragu) but Pepe is partial to their parmigiana di melanzane; layered aubergine, tomato sauce and mozzarella. \"It's incredible. For me, that's the must try,\" he says. \"They bake it in a tegamino (earthenware pot) and it's wonderful. It's cooked correctly, the ingredients are right, it's well-balanced.

{"doc_id": 89, "question": "What is the name of the fermented lamb dish that is a dietary staple in the Faroe Islands?", "answer": ["Skerpikjøt"], "doc": "Meaning \"Sheep Islands\", the Faroe Islands owe much of their unique identity to these hardy, tangle-haired creatures.\nStanding in the Faroe Islands National Archives in the capital, Tórshavn, I opened a small cardboard box and stared at an ancient book bound in leather and burnished by hundreds of years of handling.\nKnown as Seyðabrævið (the Sheep Letter), it's a collection of laws enacted in 1298 and the Faroe Islands' oldest surviving document. Among other things, it details the level of compensation to be paid if a man lets his dog chase another man's sheep; takes grazing land away from a neighbour's flock; or drives a wild sheep into another shepherd's herd, thus disturbing the \"calmer\" animals.  \nI spent a year living in these sparsely populated islands, and I never felt lonely when wandering by myself through the dark green mountains, since there were almost always sheep within view. For more than a millennium, these hardy, tangle-haired creatures have grazed the slopes clear of most vegetation apart from grass, physically sculpting the dramatic landscape of this remote, windswept nation and shaping the country's identity.\nMarooned in the North Atlantic between Scotland and Iceland, the Faroes' 18 volcanic islands are effectively a far-flung, supercharged slice of Scandinavia. They're home to traditional wood-built houses topped with turf and the kind of lightning-fast, near-universal wi-fi you might expect from other Nordic nations, but also thundering waterfalls, sharp cliffs and jaw-dropping fjords that are leading a record-breaking number of travellers to visit in 2024.\nFirst inhabited by Irish monks in the 6th Century CE and permanently settled by Vikings in the 9th Century, today the Faroe Islands are an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. The 54,000 islanders speak their own language, Faroese, which is very closely related to Old Norse. And in case there's any doubt about how crucial the islands' sure-footed sheep are to its national identity, one only has to look at its name in Faroese: Føroyar (the Sheep Islands).\nRecent studies suggest that sheep have inhabited the Faroe Islands ever since the first Irish settlers landed here. When the Vikings showed up centuries later, they named the islands after these northern European short-tailed sheep they found living here. Ever since in this rugged, remote land, the rearing of semi-wild sheep for meat and wool (alongside fishing, whaling and hunting sea birds) has been key to survival for more than a millennium.\nFlocks were traditionally sailed to specific parts of the islands and, then as now, they are usually communally owned. Most Faroese families still have a share in a flock somewhere, and many people – whether they be doctors, lawyers, tradesmen or teachers – will turn out during the autumn roundup to help with the slaughter and divide the meat fairly. And today, nearly every Faroese family still keeps a leg of fermented lamb in the larder all year long.\nVisitors to the Faroes will see these doe-eyed creatures everywhere – sometimes even in the car park of the islands' only airport – happily grazing on roundabouts or munching on the grass roofs of old Faroese buildings. In fact, the islands' 70,000 Faroese sheep easily outnumber the Faroese human population.\nThe Faroes are buffeted by some of the strongest winds in Europe and rain is likely up to 300 days per year. Not much can be grown in this thin soil: a few potatoes, turnips, some carrots and rhubarb are the main crops here. As a result, fermented lamb and mutton are dietary staples. This pungent food (known as skerpikjøt) is shaped by the Faroes' unique windy-but-never-too-cold-nor-too-warm climate.\nMore like this: • An epic road trip over and under the Atlantic Ocean • The Faroe Islands' 500-year-old fight to save its language • Iceland's original 'green' buildings\nAfter the autumn slaughter, the meat is hung in sheds called hjallur where it slowly dries and is colonised by a layer of bacteria. The meat acquires a strong cheesy flavour, passing through several stages – moist (ræst), dry (turt) and finally fermented (skerpi). According to Jógvan Páll Fjallsbak, a microbiologist at the Faroes' Food Science and Veterinary Agency, it is the rapid growth of bacteria on the meat's surface that produces its distinctive blackened appearance.\n\"We know there are more than 600 species of bacteria identified on the surface of the meat,\" he explained. \"But we still don't fully understand the chemical processes that affect the final taste of the meat. It varies according to humidity and air temperature. Some people say they can tell which island the meat has come from by the taste.\"\nIt's not only the meat that matters. There's an old saying in Faroese; \"Ull er Føroya gull\", meaning \"Wool is Faroes' gold\". Traditional Faroese knitwear still makes good use of the thick hairy yarn, and knitting clubs are found in every village. Most locals wear the distinctive Faroese hand-knitted jumpers all year round.\nIn a country named after them, it's perhaps natural that sheep have become something of a national symbol. The logo of the national tourism board is a ram's head. One of the country's most popular beer brands is Black Sheep. In the centre of Tórshavn – home to 40% of the island's population and eight of the nation's nine traffic lights – you will see a bronze statue of a ram. The horns shine where the metal has been rubbed smooth by children who love to come and sit on his back. Created by Faroese sculptor Rógvi Hansen, it is just one of several sheep monuments in the capital, including a group of stylised steel sheep munching the grass outside the Nordic House Cultural Centre.\nAside from feeding the Faroese, clothing them and mowing their roofs, sheep have also provided other civic services over the years. To help raise its tourist profile and, as the Nordic Council of Ministers put it, \"introduce the Faroe Islands to the world\", the Faroese government created a series of films in 2016 made by camera-carrying sheep. They called their Google Street View parody Sheep View, and officials say it resulted in a massive upswing in tourism awareness for the islands.\n\"We hoped people would see the funny side of Sheep View, and with a relatively small budget, we thought it might be the kind of unusual idea that would capture peoples' imaginations,\" said Guðrið Højgaard, CEO of Visit Faroe Islands. \"We do value our sheep and they are such an important part of our national identity that it seemed very fitting to make them famous around the world. I happen to think our sheep are rather pretty too.\"\nMeanwhile, Høgni Reistrup, who runs the local tour agency Guide to the Faroe Islands reports that they often receive requests from around the world for \"sheep-related itineraries\".\n\"I have had clients from other countries where sheep culture is important, like New Zealand and Australia, asking if we can supply a guide who can take them to a farm to meet a Faroese shepherd, and even to join in with the autumn roundup. It's a very photogenic time of year,\" Reistrup said.\nTourists can also sample dishes made with the islands' famous fermented lamb at restaurants in Tórshavn – notably at Ræst, located close to the harbour. Some farmers also offer traditional food experiences under the home-dining scheme known as heimablidni (home hospitality), while sheep farmer Jákup Petersen offers guided hikes on his land near the village of Kaldbak, where visitors trek to a mountain hut to sample wind-dried skerpikjøt mutton made from his own sheep.\nEva ur Dímun is the eighth generation of her family to farm sheep on the small Faroese island of Stóra Dímun, where she lives all alone with her husband JógvanJón and their roughly 500 sheep.\n\"I admire these animals, they are so tough, and not boring creatures as many people may think,\" ur Dímun told me, after an exhausting day rounding up the flock on the island's steep slopes. \"We use a lot of energy running after the sheep, and cannot survive here without food and shelter. I feel a bit inferior when I think about how well-adapted they are to surviving in this place, They produce lambs and survive all winter on just a diet of grass, and they can withstand wind and rain and snow.\"\nTo understand just how these hardy creatures learned to adapt to the Faroes' unique climate, visitors can head to Tórshavn National Museum, where a glass display case contains a little family of three brown taxidermied sheep. They are much smaller and less woolly than today's Faroese sheep, and they were captured in the late 19th Century on the uninhabited island of Lítla Dímun, just a few miles across the sea from where ur Dímun farms. They are the last-known examples of the original Faroese breed the Vikings discovered on the islands when they arrived in roughly 800 CE. Larger and heavier varieties from Scotland, Iceland and Norway replaced the native breed in the 19th Century to provide more meat and better-quality wool.  \nFrom Viking settlers to Danish landlords to modern travellers, wave after wave of settlers have blown into the Faroes with the winds over the years. But through it all, the hardy sheep has remained, sculpting the land, shaping a nation and humbly forging the Faroes' unique identity.\nTim Ecott is a former BBC World Service correspondent and the author of the book The Land of Maybe: A Faroe Islands Year.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."}
{"doc_id": 38, "question": "What is the name of the pub that has been hosting trad music sessions for over 40 years, led by tin whistle maestro Sean Ryan?", "answer": ["The Crane Bar"], "doc": "Galway native Enda Scahill shares his favorite haunts for trad music, from packed sessions at Tig Cóilí in the Latin Quarter to intimate clambake sets at Tigh Ned on Inisheer.\nGalway, with its narrow medieval streets, vibrant pub culture and unique brand of craic (lively fun), also boasts one of Ireland's best music scenes. Set in a Gaeltacht, (Irish-speaking district) the city is especially enjoying a resurgence of traditional Irish music – known locally as \"trad\", a name that gives the genre a hipster cool, far from its humble origins as tunes played in kitchens and street corners.\nWe asked Galway native Enda Scahill, one of Ireland's foremost banjo players, to help us find his hometown's best trad music sessions. At just 11 years old, Scahill was performing at pubs packed with tourists eager to experience Ireland's traditional music. \"At the time, there was definitely the perception of Irish music as shamrocks, leprechauns and 'Danny Boy'. But, just like jazz and bluegrass, there are layers upon layers of depth,\" says Scahill. \"Galway is a very small town, but you can catch two sessions a day, every day of the week… Young people proudly play old-time music, and so the quality of musicians at the moment is exceptional. We say, 'If you drop a coin out of a plane over Ireland, you'll no doubt hit a world-class fiddle player'. And banjo players too.\"\nWhen Scahill was a teen, there was one banjo player in the west of Ireland, \"and we'd drive an hour and a half, which was a big deal in rural Ireland in the '80s, what with the bad cars and bad roads\". Now, Irish banjo players are everywhere in the trad music scene, and he's taught a fair share of them.\n\"Everybody wants to come to Galway!\" he says. \"We have a fantastic reputation for fun, food and the amazing scenery of Connemara at our doorstep.\" And all are invited, listener or player. \"The sessions are very welcoming. There's no gatekeeper.\"\nHere are Scahill's favourite places to catch trad music in Galway.\n\"Tig Cóilí is probably the most famous pub in Galway,\" says Scahill. Despite its prime spot at the car-free crossroads of Mainguard and Shop Streets, this cosy pub has a country tavern feel.\nUS dollar bills, police badges and framed photos of famous faces – Paul Brady, Sharon Shannon, Dessie O'Halloran, Frankie Gavin and Máirtín O'Connor – cover the walls, giving the pub a well-worn, lived-in charm. \"It looks 100 years old, but I remember, before it became Tig Cóilí, it was a modern-style pub, mostly quiet except for, as people would say, 'swingers at two o'clock in the afternoon,' says Scahill.\nMusicians squeeze into a corner booth by the fire-engine-red windows for two daily sessions. Each session features three core players, with seven or eight others joining in. \"I played their very first session 25 years ago, with the owner's son,\" says Scahill. \"The only real change they've made since then is putting up barriers to stop tourists from falling onto the musicians.\"\nWebsite: www.tigchoiligalway.comAddress: Mainguard St, GalwayPhone: +353 91 561 294Instagram: @tigchoili\nHead out of Tig Cóilí and across the street to Taaffes, the historic stone-fronted pub that's anchored Galway's pub scene for more than 150 years. Owned by the Lally family, Taaffes was a second home to Scahill as a boy.\n\"I was playing there so much in my late teens that my mother would call the bar looking for me,\" he recalls. \"Their Guinness is fantastic, and it's always packed, morning, noon and night.\" Inside, low ceilings and cosy nooks invite lingering.\nSessions happen in a snug at the front; a stage in the back is pulled out for bigger performances. Music fills the pub twice daily; Sharon Shannon and Seán Keane have lit up the room, along with local musicians and wandering minstrels.\nOn St Patrick's Day, most pubs in Ireland lock their doors by 13:00, shifting to a one-in, one-out policy. \"Taaffes is always the first to do that because of the crowds,\" says Scahill. \"One year I played there, and it was like a war zone – people falling on stage, instruments getting kicked. You walk out feeling like you've survived Vietnam.\"\nWebsite: https://taaffesbar.ie/Address: 19 Shop Street, GalwayPhone: +353 91 564066Instagram: @taaffesbar\nFor more than 40 years, tin whistle maestro Sean Ryan, with his sharp staccato style, has led The Crane Bar's Sunday 13:00 session. \"He really looks the part, too,\" says Scahill. \"The gigantic beard, the bonnet hat. He lives in the famously haunted Leap Castle, and his biggest tune is The Coast of Austria – a nice example of Irish sardonic humour.\"\nHoused inside a Victorian cottage on Sea Road, The Crane is all character – rough floors, bright green and yellow walls and dusty framed photos of its storied history. The Guinness, with its creamy head, even backs up the pub's claim as Galway's best.\nThe pub's musical heritage runs deep. Owner Mike Crehan, a tin whistle player, is related to the legendary fiddler Junior Crehan. More sessions happen nightly at 18:00, when seasoned players and newcomers mix in a laid-back, homey atmosphere. The upstairs \"Listeners Club\" feels more like a concert venue, with bands and singer-songwriters starting at 21:00.\nWebsite: www.thecranebar.comAddress: 2 Sea Road, GalwayPhone: +353 91 587419Instagram: @thecranebar\nFrom The Crane, walk towards the River Corrib for a few minutes to find Monroe's Tavern, where Scahill has been playing since he was 15. A Galway institution since 1964, \"it's been in the Monroe family for decades and is now run by Gary Monroe, who's hugely passionate about Irish music, especially trad,\" he says.\nTrad sessions happen nightly, but the standout is Fridays at 16:30. What began a couple of years ago as a casual meet-up has since become one of the best sessions in the city, where a rotating guest joins two core musicians. \"I'll be the third every six weeks or so,\" says Scahill. \"Plus the drop-in musicians; some days, there might be 20. It's always loads of fun.\" At 19:00, Monroe's brother, who runs the tavern's pizza parlour, hands out slices to the players at the session's end.\n\"Gary's built a strong, welcoming community vibe,\" says Scahill. \"There's a guy who owns the biggest garden centre in Galway who comes every week with his double bass. His sister Mary, in her 70s, has an incredible voice. She always sits at the bar, and at some point, someone will say, 'Oh Mary, sing us a song'.' And the whole place goes quiet. It's magic.\"\nWebsite: www.monroes.ieAddress: 14 Dominick Street Upper, GalwayPhone: +353 91 583397Instagram: @monroestaverngalway\nOne of Galway's best features is how quickly the stunning countryside unfolds just outside its perimeter. Follow the Lough Corrib north for about 32km to the village of Cloughanover. \"On a very dark road in the middle of nowhere is Campbell's Tavern,\" Scahill says, \"a proper country pub, a true hidden gem.\"\nCampbell's hosts a trad session every Wednesday and a Thursday old-time bluegrass session at 22:00 that can run until 02:00. \"It's quite a big pub, and the sessions happen in the front bar, where if 50 people were in it, you couldn't turn around,\" says Scahill. \"Willie Campbell, the owner, is a very community-led guy, a big music head as well.\"\nScahill once brought Jake Workman, guitarist for Ricky Skaggs' band Kentucky Thunder, to the old-time session, where a cohort of musicians gathers in the middle and at any moment, someone from the group – or from a far corner – starts a new tune. Everyone joins in, creating a spontaneous, collaborative experience. \"Jake is one of the best guitar players in the world and he said he'd never experienced anything like it. It's an incredible, quintessential Irish experience.\"\nWebsite: www.campbellstavern.netAddress: Cloughanover, Headford, Co. Galway, H91 T4A8Phone: +353 93 35454\nDrive south from Galway along the Wild Atlantic Way for about 27km and you'll reach Kinvara, a seaside village where colourful houses line the waterfront. On the corner of Main Street and The Quay is Connolly's, a pub known for its rousing Thursday and Sunday sessions.\n\"Many world-class musicians and singers have moved out of Galway City to Kinvara, escaping traffic and high rents,\" Scahill explains, \"though of course, both followed. It's also become a real hub where Galway people meet [County] Clare people… I've only played there a handful of times, but it's a really lovely spot. They've recently added glass doors that open to an ocean view, and you hear some amazing musicians.\"\nUpstairs, the restaurant serves locally sourced dishes from Kinvara's organic farmers and foragers, adding a touch of refinement to the laid-back vibe of the sessions taking place below. Just beyond the county line is the otherworldly karst landscape of the Burren and the legendary Cliffs of Moher.\nWebsite: www.upstairsatconnollys.ieAddress: The Quay, Kinvara, Co. Galway H91 D623Phone: +353 91 637530Instagram: @connollyskinvara\n\"If you're here in the summer, you have to visit Inisheer, one of the three Aran Islands [in Galway Bay],\" says Scahill. \"First, there's the biggest, Inishmore – 'inish' means island, and 'more' means big. Then you've got Inishmaan, the middle one – 'maan' means average. Finally, there's Inisheer, since 'sheer' means small.\"\n\"They really put a lot of thought into those names,\" he deadpans.\nOn Inisheer, find Tigh Ned tucked inside a thatched cottage that's been in the Ó Conghaile family since 1897. From April to October, musicians fill the salty air with the sounds of sweet trad. \"It's as 'country pub' as you want on an island.\"\nThe kitchen serves classic pub fare and fresh seafood. Scahill recommends calling ahead to order the crab special. \"Every morning their boats come back filled with these big brown Atlantic crabs. They boil them in the back and serve them with brown bread and butter. It's the most spectacular meal you'll ever have.
