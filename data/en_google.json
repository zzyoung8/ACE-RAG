{"id": 2, "question": "What is the title of Alan Hollinghurst's debut novel?", "answer": ["The Swimming-Pool Library"], "doc": ["Jack Parlett introduces the work of literary great, Alan Hollinghurst, from his Booker-winning novel, The Line of Beauty, to his latest work, Our Evenings. Few contemporary novelists are regarded as highly as Alan Hollinghurst, and the announcement of a new novel by him, usually after a wait of several years, is heralded as a major literary event.", "However, this 36 year association (I read his first book in the year it was published) means that for me the anticipation towards a new work was huge. “Our Evenings” is Alan Hollinghurst’s best novel in 20 years. Once the excitement of the opening pages were passed I admit I did feel a little concerned.", "Gay life, fine art, and the British class system have been mainstays of Alan Hollinghurst’s fiction since his dizzyingly explicit debut novel, 1988’s The Swimming-Pool Library.", "Alan James Hollinghurst FRSL (born 26 May 1954) is an English novelist, poet, short story writer and translator. He won the 1989 Somerset Maugham Award and the 1994 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. In 2004, he won the Booker Prize for his novel The Line of Beauty.", "[8][9] Hollinghurst discussed his early life and literary influences at length in a rare interview at home in London, published in The James White Review in 1997–98.[10] He won the 2004 Booker Prize for The Line of Beauty.[11] His next novel, The Stranger's Child, made the 2011 Booker Prize longlist.", "Ever since his 1988 debut The Swimming-Pool Library caused a stir, Hollinghurst has captured the hedonism of affluent gay men with both candour and literary elegance.\n\"He looks battered, but is smiling, / like an old seaman, nearly at rest. / A gold-haired boy twirls upside-down on rings.\" These lines come from Alan Hollinghurst's poem Isherwood is at Santa Monica, published in 1975 while he was reading English at Magdalen College, Oxford. The poem depicts one of his literary forefathers, Christopher Isherwood, author of such openly queer novels as Goodbye to Berlin (1939) and A Single Man (1964), watching a much younger boy playing on the beach. The imagery is evocative of the writer Gysrav von Aschenbach, dying in his deck chair as he watches the boy Tadzio on the beach at the denouement of Thomas Mann's 1912 novella Death in Venice. As one might exclaim reading Hollinghurst's latest novel Our Evenings, plus ça change.\nHollinghurst is now entering his 70s, with seven books that have rendered his name synonymous with gay British literature over the past five decades. His earlier novels, from his debut The Swimming-Pool Library (1988) to the Booker Prize-winning The Line of Beauty (2004), focus on specific moments in time, encircled by the Aids crisis, Thatcherism, and the prohibition of the \"promotion of homosexuality\" under the UK's 1988 Section 28 law. His latest three books The Stranger's Child (2011), The Sparsholt Affair (2017), and most recently Our Evenings (2024) encompass the scope of entire gay lifetimes. There is a sense of nostalgia, but often of anemoia too – a yearning for a time and a place one has never known.  \nHollinghurst, the son of a Gloucestershire bank manager, is an outsider, wandering through the affluent streets of West London and speculating on the revelries of the gay men who gorge on champagne and cocaine while talking of Wagner and Henry James behind closed doors. Reminiscing about how he used to walk down Kensington Park Gardens several times a week when he first moved to the capital in 1981, Hollinghurst once said, \"it was all a part of my romantic sense of London as a scene of infinite possibilities, both real and fictional.\" He translated that feeling of being outside, looking in, through Will Beckwith, the narrator of The Swimming-Pool Library, who comes of age in this entitled environ. And yet entering the smoking room of the Corinthian gentlemen's club he reflects, \"I felt like an intruder in a film, who has coshed an orderly and, disguised in his coat, enters a top-secret establishment, in this case a home for people kept artificially alive.\"\nIn 1979 Hollinghurst completed his Masters with a thesis on three of his favourite authors: Ronald Firbank, LP Hartley, and EM Forster. Following the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Britain in 1967, authors grew bolder with their literary depictions of relations and relationships between men – to the point that many suppressed the elegance of literary form under the need to hastily capture gay experience. The Swimming-Pool Library was a refreshing combination of style and sex, tracing the line of the male form in delicate prose with apparent insouciance. His imagery is lightly painted, but it is graphic in the mind – a technique learned from these earlier gay authors who could not, as Hollinghurst's lesser contemporaries might, be blunt about sex.\nEach of Hollinghurst's novels might be subtitled as an ode to one of his literary heroes; The Line of Beauty to Henry James, and The Folding Star to Thomas Mann, for example. The Swimming-Pool Library is explicitly reverent of Firbank, an English author whose novels, including Valmouth (1919), were cited by Susan Sontag in her definition of \"camp\" due to their florid and humourous caricatures of the elite. Will reads Firbank voraciously in the novel, including a beautiful copy of The Flower Beneath The Foot (1923), which is symbolically destroyed when he is beaten up by a group of homophobic louts. The comfort and safety that being rich and educated often brings to gay people in the upper classes is not a constant, and occasionally ugliness mars the immaculate canvases with which Hollinghurst's protagonists envelop themselves. \nThere are sanctuaries that recur: private members' clubs, homes in West London or the country, Oxford (or sometimes Cambridge), and cultural venues. Opera and classical music drowns out the hubbub of the busy streets – in The Swimming-Pool Library Will attends a production of Billy Budd, an opera with libretto by Forster and Eric Crozier and music by Benjamin Britten. It is based on the novella by Herman Melville, about a sailor who is condemned to death for killing his master-at-arms, which is frequently read as homoerotic, as it is by Will: \"The young baritone, singing with the greatest beauty and freshness, brought an extraordinary quality of resisted pathos to Billy; in the stammering music his physiognomy, handsome and forthright and yet with a curious fleshy debility about the mouth, made me believe it as his own tragedy.\"\nWill, like Hollinghurst's other protagonists, recalls his sexuality burgeoning at Oxford. In Our Evenings, Dave Win recalls hearing from dons in their \"stammering irrelevant way about Ancient Greece and relations between boys and older men\". It is reminiscent of Forster's most obviously queer novel, Maurice, published a year after his death in 1971, in which the Cambridge student lovers at its centre learn of same-sex love through Ancient Greek writings such as Plato's Symposium. It is an Oxbridge education which opens the door of these young men to sexuality as well as to the upper echelons of British society. Hollinghurst has said, \"With the social world of public school types, these things are sort of accepted, particularly when you're young, and in a way that they're not when you’re out in the rough-and-tumble real world.\" School and university exist in Hollinghurst's world as a sort of playground of sexuality that becomes married to knowledge and taste.\nThe Line of Beauty follows Nick Guest as he housesits for an Oxford friend whose father is a Conservative MP. His academic focus is on US émigré author Henry James, whose novels inform Hollinghurst's perspective of outsiders becoming integrated into the elite, and the ensuing social dissonance. Nick is obsessed with his concept of beauty – derived from Hogarth's theory about the \"line of beauty\", a double, S-shaped curve representing the perfect form – which he draws across art, music, and the male form, rendering him blind to the behaviours of benefactors. Discussing James's novels, Nick observes that characters often call each other beautiful when they are being wicked: \"In the later books, you know, they do it more and more, when actually they're more and more ugly – in a moral sense.\"\nDave Win in Our Evenings is a slightly different proposition however. Talking to the BBC about the new novel, critic Caspar Salmon observes, \"I don't think this narrator completely meshes with the classic Hollinghurst viewpoint, which is apologetically classical and conservative, but animated by a desire to prod at everything. In the earlier books [it] is quite giddy, [but here it's] more melancholy.\" Dave is similar to Nick Guest in having been to Oxford and found himself in a higher class than that of his adolescence, but the crucial distinction is that Dave is not white. Race has been a complex theme in all of Hollinghurst's novels, with his white protagonists' narratorial gaze constantly falling upon men of colour described with fetishistic detail.\nMore like this: • Why The Great Gatsby is so misunderstood• Why Britain loves Jilly Cooper's novels• The medieval tales that broke sexual taboos\nIn The Line of Beauty, Nick apologises to a cab driver after a particularly nasty dinner guest called Barry Groom is abusive to him: \"Nick's heart went out to the Caribbean accent, in instant sentimental allegiance – he felt himself float out towards it from the cigar-choked huddle at the table, the Oxonian burble and Barry's wine.\" However, Dave in Our Evenings experiences prejudice directly, with one character observing that he is from Burma, \"and the hint of a guttural r seemed to colour the country with her own unknown assumptions about it\". Dave needs to tread more carefully in his adopted social class than Nick does, aware of the unspoken judgements they pass. It is hard to imagine Dave, for example, having the boldness to ask Margaret Thatcher for a boogie at a Tory soirée, as Nick does.\nLike Sally Bowles slowly feeling her hedonistic lifestyle in Berlin being encroached upon by the rise of Nazism in Isherwood's Goodbye to Berlin, Nick Guest is for a while blind to the impact of political homophobia and the developing Aids crisis on his beautiful existence. The epigraph for The Line of Beauty captures the weight of his ignorance, quoting the King of Hearts at the end of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland deciding whether it is \"important\" or \"unimportant\" that Alice says she knows \"nothing\" of the business at hand in her trial. Like Alice, Nick falls down the rabbit hole from innocence to experience, in the space of four years, from 1983 to 1987. \nOur Evenings by contrast is the story of a lifetime, and Dave's journey towards jaded melancholy is much longer. As critic Tim Robey tells the BBC, \"I began to worry that Hollinghurst was becoming a bit of an 'establishment writer' in the novels following The Line of Beauty. A certain cosiness was creeping in. Our Evenings is a kind of recovery – it doesn't feel cosy or complacent; it feels complete. It feels like an entire life is being reassessed and reevaluated for us.\" Dave can never feel complacent amongst his more privileged peers due to his background, something demonstrated in an extreme fashion at the novel's close. \nThe novel begins with a mention of Brexit, which may set alarm bells ringing in the British reader's discourse-weary mind. Mercifully, it is more the casual announcement of a theme at the start of a symphony or opera quickly submerged by the rest of the orchestra and yet still ringing in the ears. It is a Wagnerian leitmotif, just as Aids is in The Line of Beauty, a chord that resonates all the more deeply through its underuse. As a student Dave recalls being taught about classical music by a don called Mr Hudson: \"We must listen to it again, of course that theme's been there all the time, half-hidden, hurried along, so that you can't see its potential... Great tunes, sparingly used: that's the secret\". Ideas of a Britain lost, crumbling Empire and now Europe, emerge in a smattering of references in Hollinghurst's books such that they become his subject to greater degree than the aesthetic decorations of sex and sensibility. \n\"⁠I think my relationship to Hollinghurst's work has changed as I've got older, in roughly the same way as his protagonists – early on I read him for sex and dazzle, but now I think I appreciate his sense of queer lives shot through with grief or discomfort, odd fleeting moments of connection; his understanding of time and loss,\" reflects Salmon. \"His writing hasn't diminished in its poetry. I may have fallen out of love with Hollinghurst along the way, but I have fallen back in love with him with this book, like an old flame,\" says Robey. In Our Evenings, Dave reads an inscription on a sundial: SENSIM SINE SENSU, translated by his friend as \"slowly, without sensing it, we grow old\". While Hollinghurst's early novels feel more indebted to other gay writers, Our Evenings is of a style that can only be described as his own, rather than a rhapsody of a theme of Forster, Firbank, or James. With its broader narrative about the intensification of xenophobia and homophobia in Britain, the novel also stands as a warning to never lose sight of the bigger picture when focusing on exquisite, sensual minutiae.\nOur Evenings is out now \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Dave needs to tread more carefully in his adopted social class than Nick does, aware of the unspoken judgements they pass. It is hard to imagine Dave, for example, having the boldness to ask Margaret Thatcher for a boogie at a Tory soirée, as Nick does.\nLike Sally Bowles slowly feeling her hedonistic lifestyle in Berlin being encroached upon by the rise of Nazism in Isherwood's Goodbye to Berlin, Nick Guest is for a while blind to the impact of political homophobia and the developing Aids crisis on his beautiful existence. The epigraph for The Line of Beauty captures the weight of his ignorance, quoting the King of Hearts at the end of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland deciding whether it is \"important\" or \"unimportant\" that Alice says she knows \"nothing\" of the business at hand in her trial. Like Alice, Nick falls down the rabbit hole from innocence to experience, in the space of four years, from 1983 to 1987. \nOur Evenings by contrast is the story of a lifetime, and Dave's journey towards jaded melancholy is much longer. As critic Tim Robey tells the BBC, \"I began to worry that Hollinghurst was becoming a bit of an 'establishment writer' in the novels following The Line of Beauty. A certain cosiness was creeping in. Our Evenings is a kind of recovery – it doesn't feel cosy or complacent; it feels complete. It feels like an entire life is being reassessed and reevaluated for us.\" Dave can never feel complacent amongst his more privileged peers due to his background, something demonstrated in an extreme fashion at the novel's close. \nThe novel begins with a mention of Brexit, which may set alarm bells ringing in the British reader's discourse-weary mind. Mercifully, it is more the casual announcement of a theme at the start of a symphony or opera quickly submerged by the rest of the orchestra and yet still ringing in the ears. It is a Wagnerian leitmotif, just as Aids is in The Line of Beauty, a chord that resonates all the more deeply through its underuse. As a student Dave recalls being taught about classical music by a don called Mr Hudson: \"We must listen to it again, of course that theme's been there all the time, half-hidden, hurried along, so that you can't see its potential...

I may have fallen out of love with Hollinghurst along the way, but I have fallen back in love with him with this book, like an old flame,\" says Robey.

{"id": 4, "question": "In which year was Hollinghurst's latest novel, Our Evenings, published?", "answer": ["2024"], "doc": ["However, this 36 year association (I read his first book in the year it was published) means that for me the anticipation towards a new work was huge. “Our Evenings” is Alan Hollinghurst’s best novel in 20 years. Once the excitement of the opening pages were passed I admit I did feel a little concerned.", "Perhaps a strategic loosening of novelistic form was what Hollinghurst was going for, in an effort to capture the enigma of the recollected past. The consequence, all the same, is to point up another of the book’s shortcomings. “Our Evenings” belongs to Dave Win in a way that none of Hollinghurst’s previous novels belong to their main characters.", "There is something deliciously uncinematic about Our Evenings, the seventh novel by Alan Hollinghurst.", "Mary Mount, Picador Publisher says 'Our Evenings is a novel that is both beautifully wrought and deeply engaged with the present from one of the great writers of our times. It is an exhilarating work and I cannot wait to share it with Alan Hollinghurst's many readers around the world.", "But the opposite is true: there is too much to write about.” Our Evenings by Alan Hollinghurst is published by Pan Macmillan, and is out now.", "Ever since his 1988 debut The Swimming-Pool Library caused a stir, Hollinghurst has captured the hedonism of affluent gay men with both candour and literary elegance.\n\"He looks battered, but is smiling, / like an old seaman, nearly at rest. / A gold-haired boy twirls upside-down on rings.\" These lines come from Alan Hollinghurst's poem Isherwood is at Santa Monica, published in 1975 while he was reading English at Magdalen College, Oxford. The poem depicts one of his literary forefathers, Christopher Isherwood, author of such openly queer novels as Goodbye to Berlin (1939) and A Single Man (1964), watching a much younger boy playing on the beach. The imagery is evocative of the writer Gysrav von Aschenbach, dying in his deck chair as he watches the boy Tadzio on the beach at the denouement of Thomas Mann's 1912 novella Death in Venice. As one might exclaim reading Hollinghurst's latest novel Our Evenings, plus ça change.\nHollinghurst is now entering his 70s, with seven books that have rendered his name synonymous with gay British literature over the past five decades. His earlier novels, from his debut The Swimming-Pool Library (1988) to the Booker Prize-winning The Line of Beauty (2004), focus on specific moments in time, encircled by the Aids crisis, Thatcherism, and the prohibition of the \"promotion of homosexuality\" under the UK's 1988 Section 28 law. His latest three books The Stranger's Child (2011), The Sparsholt Affair (2017), and most recently Our Evenings (2024) encompass the scope of entire gay lifetimes. There is a sense of nostalgia, but often of anemoia too – a yearning for a time and a place one has never known.  \nHollinghurst, the son of a Gloucestershire bank manager, is an outsider, wandering through the affluent streets of West London and speculating on the revelries of the gay men who gorge on champagne and cocaine while talking of Wagner and Henry James behind closed doors. Reminiscing about how he used to walk down Kensington Park Gardens several times a week when he first moved to the capital in 1981, Hollinghurst once said, \"it was all a part of my romantic sense of London as a scene of infinite possibilities, both real and fictional.\" He translated that feeling of being outside, looking in, through Will Beckwith, the narrator of The Swimming-Pool Library, who comes of age in this entitled environ. And yet entering the smoking room of the Corinthian gentlemen's club he reflects, \"I felt like an intruder in a film, who has coshed an orderly and, disguised in his coat, enters a top-secret establishment, in this case a home for people kept artificially alive.\"\nIn 1979 Hollinghurst completed his Masters with a thesis on three of his favourite authors: Ronald Firbank, LP Hartley, and EM Forster. Following the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Britain in 1967, authors grew bolder with their literary depictions of relations and relationships between men – to the point that many suppressed the elegance of literary form under the need to hastily capture gay experience. The Swimming-Pool Library was a refreshing combination of style and sex, tracing the line of the male form in delicate prose with apparent insouciance. His imagery is lightly painted, but it is graphic in the mind – a technique learned from these earlier gay authors who could not, as Hollinghurst's lesser contemporaries might, be blunt about sex.\nEach of Hollinghurst's novels might be subtitled as an ode to one of his literary heroes; The Line of Beauty to Henry James, and The Folding Star to Thomas Mann, for example. The Swimming-Pool Library is explicitly reverent of Firbank, an English author whose novels, including Valmouth (1919), were cited by Susan Sontag in her definition of \"camp\" due to their florid and humourous caricatures of the elite. Will reads Firbank voraciously in the novel, including a beautiful copy of The Flower Beneath The Foot (1923), which is symbolically destroyed when he is beaten up by a group of homophobic louts. The comfort and safety that being rich and educated often brings to gay people in the upper classes is not a constant, and occasionally ugliness mars the immaculate canvases with which Hollinghurst's protagonists envelop themselves. \nThere are sanctuaries that recur: private members' clubs, homes in West London or the country, Oxford (or sometimes Cambridge), and cultural venues. Opera and classical music drowns out the hubbub of the busy streets – in The Swimming-Pool Library Will attends a production of Billy Budd, an opera with libretto by Forster and Eric Crozier and music by Benjamin Britten. It is based on the novella by Herman Melville, about a sailor who is condemned to death for killing his master-at-arms, which is frequently read as homoerotic, as it is by Will: \"The young baritone, singing with the greatest beauty and freshness, brought an extraordinary quality of resisted pathos to Billy; in the stammering music his physiognomy, handsome and forthright and yet with a curious fleshy debility about the mouth, made me believe it as his own tragedy.\"\nWill, like Hollinghurst's other protagonists, recalls his sexuality burgeoning at Oxford. In Our Evenings, Dave Win recalls hearing from dons in their \"stammering irrelevant way about Ancient Greece and relations between boys and older men\". It is reminiscent of Forster's most obviously queer novel, Maurice, published a year after his death in 1971, in which the Cambridge student lovers at its centre learn of same-sex love through Ancient Greek writings such as Plato's Symposium. It is an Oxbridge education which opens the door of these young men to sexuality as well as to the upper echelons of British society. Hollinghurst has said, \"With the social world of public school types, these things are sort of accepted, particularly when you're young, and in a way that they're not when you’re out in the rough-and-tumble real world.\" School and university exist in Hollinghurst's world as a sort of playground of sexuality that becomes married to knowledge and taste.\nThe Line of Beauty follows Nick Guest as he housesits for an Oxford friend whose father is a Conservative MP. His academic focus is on US émigré author Henry James, whose novels inform Hollinghurst's perspective of outsiders becoming integrated into the elite, and the ensuing social dissonance. Nick is obsessed with his concept of beauty – derived from Hogarth's theory about the \"line of beauty\", a double, S-shaped curve representing the perfect form – which he draws across art, music, and the male form, rendering him blind to the behaviours of benefactors. Discussing James's novels, Nick observes that characters often call each other beautiful when they are being wicked: \"In the later books, you know, they do it more and more, when actually they're more and more ugly – in a moral sense.\"\nDave Win in Our Evenings is a slightly different proposition however. Talking to the BBC about the new novel, critic Caspar Salmon observes, \"I don't think this narrator completely meshes with the classic Hollinghurst viewpoint, which is apologetically classical and conservative, but animated by a desire to prod at everything. In the earlier books [it] is quite giddy, [but here it's] more melancholy.\" Dave is similar to Nick Guest in having been to Oxford and found himself in a higher class than that of his adolescence, but the crucial distinction is that Dave is not white. Race has been a complex theme in all of Hollinghurst's novels, with his white protagonists' narratorial gaze constantly falling upon men of colour described with fetishistic detail.\nMore like this: • Why The Great Gatsby is so misunderstood• Why Britain loves Jilly Cooper's novels• The medieval tales that broke sexual taboos\nIn The Line of Beauty, Nick apologises to a cab driver after a particularly nasty dinner guest called Barry Groom is abusive to him: \"Nick's heart went out to the Caribbean accent, in instant sentimental allegiance – he felt himself float out towards it from the cigar-choked huddle at the table, the Oxonian burble and Barry's wine.\" However, Dave in Our Evenings experiences prejudice directly, with one character observing that he is from Burma, \"and the hint of a guttural r seemed to colour the country with her own unknown assumptions about it\". Dave needs to tread more carefully in his adopted social class than Nick does, aware of the unspoken judgements they pass. It is hard to imagine Dave, for example, having the boldness to ask Margaret Thatcher for a boogie at a Tory soirée, as Nick does.\nLike Sally Bowles slowly feeling her hedonistic lifestyle in Berlin being encroached upon by the rise of Nazism in Isherwood's Goodbye to Berlin, Nick Guest is for a while blind to the impact of political homophobia and the developing Aids crisis on his beautiful existence.

Like Alice, Nick falls down the rabbit hole from innocence to experience, in the space of four years, from 1983 to 1987. \nOur Evenings by contrast is the story of a lifetime, and Dave's journey towards jaded melancholy is much longer.

{"id": 5, "question": "In which year was The Last Man on Earth released?", "answer": ["1924"], "doc": ["The last one was The Last Man on Earth. Rage of the Buccaneers was released in the US in 1963; the other two were released in 1964. The copyright on The Last Man on Earth is 1963, however. [4] Interestingly, the star of the film, Lamberto Maggiorani, was not (at that time) a professional actor.", "[12] As of March 2024, The Last Man on Earth holds a 79% rating at the film review aggregator Web site Rotten Tomatoes from 28 reviews.[13] Phil Hall of Film Threat called The Last Man on Earth \"the best Vincent Price movie ever made\".", "But I will say this for The Last Man on Earth: it does not seem like the sort of thing that would be a primetime network sitcom. And that's precisely why it should be one. James Poniewozik of Time[47] The Last Man on Earth received generally positive reviews from critics.", "The Last Man on Earth was the first of at least four adaptations of Richard Matheson’s now classic 1954 novel I Am Legend. (At the time of its release, it was not terribly well reviewed — but then, horror and science fiction has not traditionally received the highest of praise when first released.", "But The Last Man on Earth is now and always will be the 1964 classic starring Vincent Price. It was the first psychotronic film I ever saw — at the age of 5. And I had nightmares about it for years. Any film that gives children nightmares for years can’t be all bad and is probably really good. The Last Man on Earth is great.", "The Last Man on Earth is one of the earliest films in history to feature a female president of the US. It set the tone for the films and shows that came next.\nOne hundred years ago, a woman was elected as the president of the United States. This didn't happen in reality, of course, but a fictional female president did appear in a film that was released exactly a century ago, in 1924 – and it's one of the earliest surviving on-screen examples of a woman in that role.\nThe Last Man on Earth is a silent comedy starring Earle Foxe and directed by JG Blystone. Foxe plays Elmer, the one adult male in the future year of 1954 who hasn't been snuffed out by a disease called \"masculitis\". Luckily for him, he was living alone in a forest when the virus struck, so when he is brought back to civilisation, he is a sought-after specimen. The government buys him for $10m and two \"senatresses\" have a boxing match for the right to marry him – but Elmer only has eyes for his childhood sweetheart.\nAdapted from a short story by John D Swain, The Last Man on Earth is really an excuse to have some risqué fun with the male fantasy of being pursued by countless women. \"Little, if any, attempt is made to conceal the fact that they are impelled by sex impulse,\" tutted the Virginia State Board of Censors in its review of this \"smutty\" and \"indecent\" work. But the film also mocks the very idea of a society with women in charge. The White House is overgrown and unkempt, while the president herself (Martha Mattox) prefers to tend to stray cats than to run the country.\n\"Just imagine,\" says Erika Cornelius Smith, director of Research Strategy at the University of Illinois, and an expert on depictions of women in fiction. \"Women boxing! Women in government! The only way audiences could cope with this type of thing in popular culture was that they knew it was absurd and it would never happen.\"\nFor the rest of the 20th Century, there weren't many other female US presidents on screen. Betty Boop and Olive Oyl made brief animated trips to the White House in 1932 and 1948, respectively, but most film-makers stuck to the familiar status quo of male presidents. \"Popular culture is a space of creativity and imagination and possibility,\" says Smith. \"But [film and television creators] struggle to balance this wonderful opportunity to be creative with the need to sell advertising and make a profit. Their shows have to have a market. Possibility and profitability are always going to compete.\"\nBut why would a female president threaten that profitability? If a film or a TV series departs from reality in other regards, why shouldn't it shake things up in this particular way, too? Karrin Vasby Anderson of Colorado State University is the co-author of a book on the subject, Woman President, and she argues that, in the past, such a character might have put off more conservative viewers. \"The US presidency has long been one of the world's most important displays of traditional masculinity and heteronormative family values, with the first lady playing an important supporting role,\" she says. \"A woman president upends that.\"\nThat could be one reason why, when a female president does crop up on screen, she is rarely taken seriously: in many respects, the president in The Last Man on Earth set the tone for her less-than-inspiring successors for decades to come. One recurring element is that the scenario is set in the future when, the implication goes, the world is bizarrely different from our own. The first example of this, after The Last Man on Earth, is Project Moonbase, which was released in 1953 and set in the year 1970. Ernestine Barrier plays madam president, and other women occupy positions of power – although as Smith points out, the heroine (Donna Martell), a colonel in charge of a lunar mission, is \"easily frightened and turns to her male colleague and love interest as soon as the situation becomes dangerous\".\nFemale presidents would go on to be seen in the imagined futures and futuristic alternate realities conjured up by Back to The Future Part II (1989), Battlestar Galactica (2003-2009), Independence Day: Resurgence (2016), For All Mankind (2019-present) and Don't Look Up (2021). In Bart to the Future, an episode of The Simpsons from 2000, Lisa Simpson grows up to be \"America's first straight female president\". One of the episode's prescient jokes is that her predecessor was a certain President Trump.\nAnother trope is that female presidents aren't often put in the White House by an ordinary, free and fair election, but by a crisis. It's an especially severe crisis in The Last Man on Earth, of course. To quote Farran Smith Nehme in Film Comment: \"For a woman to be elected president, literally every single man on Earth – save one tree-dwelling hermit who presumably wasn't registered to vote – had to die first.\" But even in less extreme scenarios, it's common in films and shows for a woman to step in only after the male president has died or resigned while in office. Just look at some of the most recent examples: Geena Davis's Mackenzie Allen in Commander in Chief (2005), Patricia Wettig's Caroline Reynolds in Prison Break (2005-2017), Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Selina Meyer in Veep (2012-2019), and Robin Wright's Claire Hale Underwood in House of Cards (2013-2018) all became presidents without voters' approval.\nSimilarly, the fictional women themselves aren't always keen to do the job. \"In television and film, the only women who can be trusted as US president are those who don't want to be there,\" says Anderson. \"Heroic women presidents, like Téa Leoni's character in Madam Secretary, have to be dragged into public service. Women with political ambition, such as Cherry Jones's president in 24 and Julia Louis-Dreyfus's character in Veep, prove to be untrustworthy, or their presidencies often end in tragedy. Fictional male presidents can be principled, effective, and politically ambitious. Women on screen still have to choose between ambition and trustworthiness.\"\nMore like this:• 10 great films about US presidential elections• The most misunderstood Oscar winner ever• Why Joker 2's mega budget spelled disaster\nAnother lingering trope is that female presidents on screen seem to have trouble concentrating on governing. The president in The Last Man on Earth is busy with stray cats, but her later equivalents are usually distracted by their husbands and children. Hail to the Chief, an ABC sitcom from 1985, had Patty Duke as Julia Mansfield, a president juggling politics with family. Twenty years on in 2005, the advertisements for ABC's Commander in Chief billed Davis's character as \"a woman president who has the world on her shoulders and her children on her back\".\nStill, 100 years after The Last Man on Earth, the tropes are changing, however slowly. There have already been more fictional female presidents in the 21st Century than there were in the 20th, and there are even cases in which their gender isn't the main issue. Meryl Streep's Janie Orlean in Don't Look Up (2021) may be a terrible president, but that's not because she's a woman, while Alfre Woodard's Constance Payton in State of Affairs (2014-2015) is competent and tough.\nHillary's Clinton's presidential bid in 2016 was undoubtedly influential. \"Certainly the visibility of candidates like Hillary Clinton made a significant impact on these types of characters,\" says Smith. \"I don't think Elizabeth McCord [in Madam Secretary], for instance, is exactly based on Clinton, but there was a level of seriousness to Clinton's candidacy which lent itself to McCord's candidacy. And that show really struck me as different from the mould in a lot of ways, both in that it was trying to address the stereotypes in prior depictions, and it was trying to move past them.\"\nIn general, Smith adds, the more women in politics there are in reality, the more there are in fiction – and, potentially, vice versa. \"These shows were made when there were very serious candidates running not just for president but for governor and for positions in the Senate and Congress, so having real examples cues writers and those in the industry to start thinking about storylines with those characters. Reciprocally, how they then craft those characters and storylines shapes how we imagine those individuals will act in office, so I see it as a feedback loop.\"\nIt's worth considering a film that was ahead of its time… most of the way through, anyway. Kisses for My President is a 1964 comedy in which Polly Bergen plays the president, and Fred MacMurray plays her husband, who struggles with being a \"male first lady\". \"It actually offers a pretty progressive depiction of a woman president,\" says Anderson. \"She's a smart and skilled politician voted into office by a united and enthusiastic cohort of women voters.\"\nThe film didn't carry its progressive premise all the way through, however. After the president faints, she discovers that she is pregnant, so she resigns from office to devote herself to motherhood. \"You can't work and be pregnant – you can't work and raise a family, that's absurd,\" laughs Smith. \"And if the president can't work and raise a family, that definitely sends a message to the rest of women in society.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Ernestine Barrier plays madam president, and other women occupy positions of power – although as Smith points out, the heroine (Donna Martell), a colonel in charge of a lunar mission, is \"easily frightened and turns to her male colleague and love interest as soon as the situation becomes dangerous\".\nFemale presidents would go on to be seen in the imagined futures and futuristic alternate realities conjured up by Back to The Future Part II (1989), Battlestar Galactica (2003-2009), Independence Day: Resurgence (2016), For All Mankind (2019-present) and Don't Look Up (2021). In Bart to the Future, an episode of The Simpsons from 2000, Lisa Simpson grows up to be \"America's first straight female president\". One of the episode's prescient jokes is that her predecessor was a certain President Trump.\nAnother trope is that female presidents aren't often put in the White House by an ordinary, free and fair election, but by a crisis. It's an especially severe crisis in The Last Man on Earth, of course. To quote Farran Smith Nehme in Film Comment: \"For a woman to be elected president, literally every single man on Earth – save one tree-dwelling hermit who presumably wasn't registered to vote – had to die first.\" But even in less extreme scenarios, it's common in films and shows for a woman to step in only after the male president has died or resigned while in office. Just look at some of the most recent examples: Geena Davis's Mackenzie Allen in Commander in Chief (2005), Patricia Wettig's Caroline Reynolds in Prison Break (2005-2017), Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Selina Meyer in Veep (2012-2019), and Robin Wright's Claire Hale Underwood in House of Cards (2013-2018) all became presidents without voters' approval.\nSimilarly, the fictional women themselves aren't always keen to do the job. \"In television and film, the only women who can be trusted as US president are those who don't want to be there,\" says Anderson. \"Heroic women presidents, like Téa Leoni's character in Madam Secretary, have to be dragged into public service. Women with political ambition, such as Cherry Jones's president in 24 and Julia Louis-Dreyfus's character in Veep, prove to be untrustworthy, or their presidencies often end in tragedy. Fictional male presidents can be principled, effective, and politically ambitious. Women on screen still have to choose between ambition and trustworthiness.\"\nMore like this:• 10 great films about US presidential elections• The most misunderstood Oscar winner ever• Why Joker 2's mega budget spelled disaster\nAnother lingering trope is that female presidents on screen seem to have trouble concentrating on governing. The president in The Last Man on Earth is busy with stray cats, but her later equivalents are usually distracted by their husbands and children. Hail to the Chief, an ABC sitcom from 1985, had Patty Duke as Julia Mansfield, a president juggling politics with family. Twenty years on in 2005, the advertisements for ABC's Commander in Chief billed Davis's character as \"a woman president who has the world on her shoulders and her children on her back\".\nStill, 100 years after The Last Man on Earth, the tropes are changing, however slowly. There have already been more fictional female presidents in the 21st Century than there were in the 20th, and there are even cases in which their gender isn't the main issue. Meryl Streep's Janie Orlean in Don't Look Up (2021) may be a terrible president, but that's not because she's a woman, while Alfre Woodard's Constance Payton in State of Affairs (2014-2015) is competent and tough.\nHillary's Clinton's presidential bid in 2016 was undoubtedly influential. \"Certainly the visibility of candidates like Hillary Clinton made a significant impact on these types of characters,\" says Smith. \"I don't think Elizabeth McCord [in Madam Secretary], for instance, is exactly based on Clinton, but there was a level of seriousness to Clinton's candidacy which lent itself to McCord's candidacy. And that show really struck me as different from the mould in a lot of ways, both in that it was trying to address the stereotypes in prior depictions, and it was trying to move past them.\"\nIn general, Smith adds, the more women in politics there are in reality, the more there are in fiction – and, potentially, vice versa. \"These shows were made when there were very serious candidates running not just for president but for governor and for positions in the Senate and Congress, so having real examples cues writers and those in the industry to start thinking about storylines with those characters. Reciprocally, how they then craft those characters and storylines shapes how we imagine those individuals will act in office, so I see it as a feedback loop.\"\nIt's worth considering a film that was ahead of its time… most of the way through, anyway. Kisses for My President is a 1964 comedy in which Polly Bergen plays the president, and Fred MacMurray plays her husband, who struggles with being a \"male first lady\". \"It actually offers a pretty progressive depiction of a woman president,\" says Anderson. \"She's a smart and skilled politician voted into office by a united and enthusiastic cohort of women voters.\"\nThe film didn't carry its progressive premise all the way through, however. After the president faints, she discovers that she is pregnant, so she resigns from office to devote herself to motherhood. \"You can't work and be pregnant – you can't work and raise a family, that's absurd,\" laughs Smith. \"And if the president can't work and raise a family, that definitely sends a message to the rest of women in society.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}
{"id": 7, "question": "How many paintings did Monet create during his visits to London between 1899 and 1901?", "answer": ["Nearly 100 paintings"], "doc": ["Between 1899 and 1901, Monet made three extended visits to London, where he painted nearly 100 views of the Thames River and its iconic landmarks, including Charing Cross Bridge, Waterloo Bridge, and the Houses of Parliament. These paintings are celebrated for their evocative portrayal of London’s fog, a phenomenon Monet found uniquely compelling.", "Attracted to London because of the striking effects created by the fog, smoke, and rain, Monet painted nearly 100 views along the river between 1899 and 1901. These works established Monet as a 20th-century master whose influence was strongly felt by a rising generation of modernists.", "In three visits to London between 1899 and 1901, the French Impressionist, then approaching 60 years of age, embarked upon one of the most ambitious series of penetrating paintings ever undertaken by any artist – a project that is now the focus of a groundbreaking exhibition at the Courtauld Institute, Monet and London: Views of the Thames.", "by a cacophony of animals and machines\". The hellish scene was a source of great inspiration to Claude Monet, who visited three times between 1899 and 1901 and painted dozens of pictures of the view from his room at the Savoy hotel.", "Monet painted over 40 versions of Waterloo Bridge during three London sojourns between 1899 and 1901. He saw these paintings both individually and as an ensemble that, collectively, expressed his sense of the essential subject—the atmosphere and colors of the fog-bound landscape of London’s Thames River.", "A new exhibition charts how Claude Monet's revolutionary, fog-shrouded visions of the Thames would \"irreversibly alter how London saw itself\".\nSome artists help us perceive the world more precisely. A rare few go further. They look beyond looking. Theirs is a deeper reality, more felt than seen. Claude Monet is one of those. In three visits to London between 1899 and 1901, the French Impressionist, then approaching 60 years of age, embarked upon one of the most ambitious series of penetrating paintings ever undertaken by any artist – a project that is now the focus of a groundbreaking exhibition at the Courtauld Institute, Monet and London: Views of the Thames. \nFrom a murky miasma of toxic, soot-laced smog that choked the very breath of the Thames, Monet magicked up nearly 100 paintings – more than he would devote to any other subject in his long career. His evanescent visions, which dissolve the heft of London's crowded bridges and imposing palaces into intangible tapestries of vibrating vapour, would shape forever the way the world conceived of the \"unreal city\", as TS Eliot would later call it – a place beyond place that sits outside of time, an ethereal elsewhere.\nConsider the evaporative power of a single instalment of the sprawling series, London, The Houses of Parliament, Shaft of Sunlight in the Fog. Among the best known of Monet's views of the Thames, the painting captures the propulsive turrets of the Palace of Westminster, juddering in a flash of late-afternoon sun that teasingly transparentises a curtain of fog that shrouds the neo-Gothic structure.\nDuring the artist's second stay in London in 1901, Monet began chronicling the fluctuating temperaments of the Houses of Parliament from a covered terrace of the recently constructed St Thomas's Hospital, directly across the river from the palace on the Southbank. A year earlier, the artist had begun translating, from the balcony of his sixth-floor rooms in the Savoy Hotel where the series began in September 1899, the shifting dispositions of dawn light as it alchemised the rigid reach of Waterloo Bridge and Charing Cross Bridge into luminous levitations. The ensuing studies of the Houses of Parliament, caught at different times of the day and in varying densities of smog and mist, demonstrate a further intensification of the artist's understanding of the very essence of his subject.\nWhile Monet's work is often celebrated for its exquisite portrayal of light, there is a slight, though significant, imprecision in the praise. What distinguishes his paintings from those of Pissarro, Morisot and his other Impressionist peers is their conviction in the annihilating potential of sun-soaked air, which Monet sees as key to comprehending the ephemerality of form. The world is a mesmerising mirage. Through the lens of Monet's painting, form – no matter how stony or static, intransigent or inert – is fungible. It fights for survival.\nOn first seeing a display of Monet's London paintings five years later, a US collector and writer attested to the retinal riddle presented by Monet's enthralling canvases, which seem to reverse the respective concretions of material substance and refulgent air. The urban infrastructures, Desmond FitzGerald explained: \"are all so misty that at first the beholder gazes with astonishment at what seems to be a half-finished picture; but gradually, as the eye penetrates the fog, objects begin to come out… The illusion is wonderful, and has never been attempted in exactly the same manner before. The Houses of Parliament shine out of the fog with the colour of old-rose or purple.\"\nFitzGerald's insistence that what Monet had seized was at once \"an illusion\" and something never before articulated by an artist is telling. Introduced into English in the middle of the 14th Century, the word \"illusion\" is related to \"ludicrous\" and initially denoted a jeering act of mocking deception. Is it possible that Monet's mesmeric depictions of the Thames differ so markedly from those of earlier artists because they don't, in fact, capture his subject as it actually appeared? Are his paintings, in truth, resplendent lies?\nMonet was the first to confess that in order to make London a suitable subject for him to take on, a fabricating Insta-filter was required. \"Without the fog,\" he remarked, \"London wouldn't be a beautiful city. It's the fog that gives it its magnificent breadth. Its regular and massive blocks become grandiose within that mysterious cloak.\" The sheer panic that Monet suffered when he pulled back the curtains in his hotel room – to discover the crisp, clean light of a mistless morning – is palpable. \"Upon getting up,\" he confided to his wife in a letter written in March 1900, \"I was terrified to see that there was no fog, not even the hint of mist; I was devastated and already seeing all my canvases ruined.\" His relief when, \"little by little, with the fires lighting up, smoke and mist returned,\" only corroborates the suspicion that London, as a place, was all but incidental to his purposes. What he was really compiling weren't studies of a city but experiments in optics – a pioneering treatise on the undiscovered properties of light itself.\nIt is among the more intriguing, and under-explored, cultural coincidences that Monet's audacious series, which provocatively posits light as pulsing parcels deftly described in short brushstrokes, began at the same moment that, in Germany, the theoretical physicist Max Planck was celebrating a breakthrough in his own conception of light as quanta, or packets of energy. Light, it seems, was in the air. By seizing upon the murky medium of virulent vapours spewing from the chimneys of the factories that crammed the banks of the river – Blake's \"dark satanic mills\" – Monet painstakingly tested his paradoxical hypothesis that what is most worth seeing is what is least visible: the vibrating veil that invigorates reality.\nMore like this:• Why there is more to Banksy than meets the eye• This iconic English painting is not what it seems• The overlooked painting that unlocks Impressionism\nSo acclimatised are our eyes to seeing the Thames through the smudgy lens of Monet's scintillating smoggles, it is almost impossible to imagine how the river could be perceived before he made us aware of the weave of fog's \"mysterious cloak\". Writing in the same year that Monet first set up his easel in the Savoy, Oscar Wilde wrestled with the very existence of fog in his essay The Decay of Lying. \"At present, people see fogs, not because there are fogs,\" Wilde mused: \"but because poets and painters have taught them the mysterious loveliness of such effects. There may have been fogs for centuries in London. I dare say there were. But no one saw them, and so we do not know anything about them. They did not exist till Art had invented them.\"\nAs if commenting directly on Monet's works, which would not be shown for another five years, Wilde concludes that: \"things are because we see them, and what we see, and how we see it, depends on the Arts that have influenced us. To look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing. One does not see anything until one sees its beauty.\" Monet's disassembly of soot-laced fog into a diaphanous fabric (replete with \"all sorts of colours\", as the artist himself explained; \"there are black, brown, yellow, green, purple fogs\") would soon supersede the visions of his predecessors and irreversibly alter how London saw itself.\nSet side-by-side comparable views of the Thames by Monet and by his esteemed British forebear, JMW Turner, to whom the Impressionist was occasionally likened, and it is difficult to believe that the two artists set their easels in the same city. Turner's 1830-35 painting The Thames Above Waterloo Bridge, which glimpses the city from a similar vantage to Monet's Waterloo Bridge, Sunlight Effect, 1900, illustrates the divergence. While both artists are obsessed with light, for Turner the Sun was a muscular god, not a fine hook ripping at the threads holding reality together. In Turner's canvas, smoke belching forth from a factory is not a blessing but a scar. The dark billows seem to assume the shape of a yelping black dog, leaping from a chimney, scratching at the sky. The poisonous pollution is an irritation, not a revelation.\nTo appreciate just how revolutionary Monet's vision of London was at the turn of the 20th Century, one need merely compare it with that of his younger self. Thirty years earlier, the fledgling artist, then in his late 20s, took refuge in London, fleeing his hometown of Le Havre to avoid fighting in the Franco-Prussian War. An early painting by Monet that he undertook at the time, The Thames below Westminster, 1871, illustrates the instinctive allure fog held for him and finds the emerging artist gracefully weighing the relative gravities of light and levitations of architecture, as the Houses of Parliament begin to lose themselves in the tightening fabric of fog. But what holds our focus is not the strobing analysis of light's essence that we find in his later paintings, such as Charing Cross Bridge, The Thames, 1903, but the rigid armature of the wooden pier we see being constructed clamorously on the right of the canvas. The fog is vivid, not yet vital.\nThough we tend to think of Impressionism as a movement devoted to capturing – quickly and at first hand – fleeting moments, Monet's London series succeeded in turning this ideology on its head. Far from chronicling transitory glimmers, the Thames paintings are complex compressions of multiple moments artificially fused, reworked continuously over an expanse not of minutes but years. Rather than tending to a single canvas at a time, Monet would strew about his hotel room scores of fragmentary studies – fits-and-starts he would fumble for when a particular cohesion of mist, smoke and sunlight would reappear again. As no given light effect would linger more than a few minutes, every canvas is a palimpsest of echoing atmospherics. \nBack in his studio in Giverny, Monet spent four years revising his visions in an effort to coax from their archaeologies of light harmonies that could hold them together like a symphony. The result is an immersive, misunderstood, multi-panel masterpiece that was scattered to the four winds when the paintings were sold off individually to international collectors. The Courtauld's exhibition offers a precious opportunity to surround oneself with more than  a third of the works that Monet started between 1899 and 1901 – a convergence of wonder that shaped the way we see and, like the miracles of light they capture, may never occur again. \nMonet and London. Views of the Thames is at the Courtauld Gallery, London, until 19 Jan 2025.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}
{"id": 8, "question": "Who directed the 1984 film The Terminator?", "answer": ["James Cameron"], "doc": ["Skydance responded that it had a deal in place with Cameron and that it \"controls the rights to the Terminator franchise for the foreseeable future\".[26] The Terminator is a 1984 science fiction action film released by Orion Pictures, co-written and directed by James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn.", "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, released by Warner Bros.

On its opening week, The Terminator played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one at the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh, God! You Devil.", "[127] In 2019, Huw Fullerton of Radio Times ranked it the second best film of the six in the franchise, stating \"The Terminator was a brilliantly original, visceral and genuinely scary movie when it was released in 1984, and no matter how badly the visual effects age it hasn't lost its impact.", "The Terminator is a 1984 American science fiction action film directed by James Cameron, written by Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd and produced by Hurd.", "Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, the 1984 blockbuster The Terminator has become synonymous with the dangers of superintelligent machines. But it \"helps and hinders\" our understanding of AI.\nIn one episode of the HBO sitcom Silicon Valley, Thomas Middleditch (Richard Hendricks) is explaining his machine-learning platform Pied Piper to a focus group when one participant inevitably compares it to James Cameron's 1984 film The Terminator. \"No, no, no,\" insists the exasperated Middleditch. \"I can assure you that there is no Skynet type of situation here. No, Pied Piper will in no way become sentient and try to take over the world.\" Too late. He's lost the room.\nWith its killer robots and its rogue AI system, Skynet, The Terminator has become synonymous with the spectre of a machine intelligence that turns against its human creators. Picture editors routinely illustrate articles about AI with the chrome death's head of the film's T-800 \"hunter-killer\" robot. The roboticist Ronald Arkin used clips from the film in a cautionary 2013 talk called How NOT to build a Terminator.\nBut the film is a mixed blessing. The philosopher Nick Bostrom, whose 2014 book Superintelligence popularised the existential risk of \"unaligned AI\" (AI that is not aligned with human values and wellbeing) admitted that his wife \"teases me about the Terminator and the robot army\". In his book The Road to Conscious Machines, AI researcher Michael Woolridge frames an entire chapter with a complaint about \"the Terminator narrative of AI\".\nThere are more recent, and more plausible, influential films about AI, including Ex Machina and Her, but when it comes to the dangers of the technology, The Terminator reigns supreme 40 years after its release. \"It's almost, in a funny way, more germane now than it was when it came out,\" Cameron told The Ringer about the film and its 1991 sequel, \"because AI is now a real thing that we have to deal with, and then it was a fantasy.\"\nThis is quite an achievement for a film that is not, in fact, particularly interested in AI. First and foremost, it is a lean and lurid thriller about an unstoppable \"man\" chasing a scared but resourceful woman. The T-800 is an implacable killer in the vein of Michael Myers from Halloween. Cameron called it \"a science-fiction slasher film\". Secondarily, it is a time-travel film on the theme of \"fate vs will\", as Cameron put it.\nThe briskly sketched premise is that at some point between 1984 and 2029, the US entrusted its entire defence system to Skynet. One day, Skynet achieved superintelligence – a mind of its own – and initiated a global nuclear war. Humanity's survivors then waged a decades-long rebellion against Skynet's robot army. By 2029, the human resistance is on the verge of victory thanks to the leadership of one John Connor, so Skynet dispatches a T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to 1984 to kill John's mother-to-be Sarah (Linda Hamilton) before she becomes pregnant. The resistance responds by sending back Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to stop the T-800 and save Sarah. In one of those time-loop paradoxes that viewers should not examine too closely, Kyle hooks up with Sarah and turns out to be John's father. The future is saved.\nThe Terminator, then, is a thriller, a love story, a time-hopping rumination on free will and a satire about our dependence on technology. It is anti-corporate, anti-war, anti-gun and largely anti-machine. Technology, from answering machines to Walkmans, is involved when people get killed in this film. But it has very little to say about AI itself.\nThe Terminator would become one of the most profitable films of all time, grossing $78.4m, but Cameron had no expectation of creating a cultural touchstone. He wrote the screenplay in a tatty hotel in Rome in 1982 after being fired from his first directing gig, Piranha II: The Spawning, and his producer Gale Ann Hurd could only rustle up a $6.4m budget. His lead actor, a former bodybuilder of unproven talent, did not have high hopes. Schwarzenegger told a friend about \"some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple of weeks\".\nCameron himself expected The Terminator to get \"stomped\" at the box office by the autumn's two sci-fi epics: David Lynch's Dune and Peter Hyams's 2010: The Year We Make Contact, a soon-forgotten sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey. There's an attractive synchronicity here: not only did The Terminator outperform 2010 but Skynet came to supplant 2001's murderous computer HAL 9000 as the dominant image of AI gone bad.\nLong before the field of AI existed, its potential dangers manifested in the form of the robot, created by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play RUR and popularised by Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis. In his excellent BFI book on The Terminator, Sean French suggests that the movie's most memorable image – the T-800 striding out of the flames, its suit of flesh melted away to expose its metallic endoskeleton – was a nod to the burning robot in Metropolis. In the 1920s, it stood to reason that machine intelligence would walk and talk, like Frankenstein's monster. The popularity of lethal robots led the science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, in 1942, to draw up the \"three laws of robotics\": the first ever attempt to define ethical AI.\nIn the real world, the field of artificial intelligence officially began in 1956 at a summer school at Dartmouth University, organised by computer scientists John McCarthy (who coined the term) and Marvin Minsky. Their ambition was to design machines that could think like humans, but this proved much harder than they had imagined. The history of AI is one of boom and bust: a cycle of so-called \"AI springs\" and \"AI winters\". Mindboggling promises attract attention, funding and talent; their failure to materialise causes all three to slump.\nThe boom of the 1960s, before the scale of the technical obstacles became apparent, is known as the Golden Age of AI. Extravagant hype about \"electronic brains\" excited director Stanley Kubrick and writer Arthur C Clarke, who integrated AI into 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey in the form of HAL 9000. The name (meaning Heuristically Programmed Algorithmic Computer) came from Minsky himself, hired as a consultant by Kubrick. The T-800's red eyes are surely a homage to HAL – seeing 2001 as a child set Cameron on the path to becoming a film-maker.\nDaniel Crevier, a historian of AI, contrasted the HAL scenario (poorly programmed computer goes awry) with the scenario in DF Jones's 1966 thriller Colossus (computer becomes a god-like new lifeform). In Jones's novel, the US government unwisely entrusts its entire defence machinery to the titular supercomputer. Colossus achieves sentience, joins forces with its Soviet counterpart and blackmails humanity into submitting to a techno-dictatorship: surrender or face nuclear annihilation. Colossus is a proto-Skynet.\nNeither HAL nor Colossus had – or needed – bodies. Cameron's brilliant innovation was to combine the out-of-control computer (Skynet) with the killer robot (the T-800). The T-800 is a single-purpose form of AI that can learn from its environment, solve problems, perform sophisticated physical tasks and deepfake voices, yet struggles to hold a conversation. Skynet, it seems, can do everything but move.\nSkynet was a product of the second AI spring. While Cameron was writing the screenplay, the British-Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton was rethinking and reviving research into the neural-net approach to AI: modelling machine intelligence on the neurons in the human brain. Skynet is neural-net AI. Hinton, who has just won the Nobel Prize for physics, has recently become an AI doomer (\"My intuition is: we're toast. This is the actual end of history\"), but according to a New Yorker profile, he enjoyed The Terminator in 1984: \"It didn't bother him that Skynet… was a neural net; he was pleased to see the technology portrayed as promising.\"\nThe name Skynet may also have been a nod to Star Wars, President Reagan's doomed dream of creating an anti-nuclear shield around the US with space-based lasers. (Fortunately for the franchise's future, it also inadvertently echoed the internet – a word that existed in 1984 but was not widely used until the 1990s.) The portmanteau names of ambitious new start-ups like IntelliCorp, Syntelligence and TeKnowledge possibly inspired Cameron to crunch down the original name of Skynet's creator, Cyber Dynamics Corporation, into Cyberdyne Systems.\nRewatching The Terminator now, it is surprising to find that the word Skynet is only uttered twice. According to Kyle Reese it was: \"New. Powerful. Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all. They say it got smart… a new order of intelligence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided our fate in a microsecond… extermination.\" That's the extent of the film's interest in AI. As Cameron has often said, the Terminator films are really about people rather than machines.\nThe blockbuster 1991 sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day filled out the story a little. It springs from another time paradox: the central processing unit and right arm of the original Terminator survived its destruction and enabled Cyberdyne scientist Miles Bennett Dyson (Joe Morton) to design Skynet. The heroes' task now is not just to save 10-year-old John Connor from the time-travelling T-1000 but to destroy Skynet in the digital cradle. (This was Cameron's last word on the subject until he produced and co-wrote 2019's Terminator: Dark Fate. He recently told Empire magazine that all the intervening sequels were \"discountable\".)\nIn Terminator 2, a Schwarzenegger-shaped T-800 is protector rather than hunter, and therefore the bearer of exposition: \"The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997. Human decisions are removed from strategic defence. Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate. It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29th. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.\" Skynet fights back by launching nuclear missiles at Russia, in the knowledge that the counter-attack will devastate the US. Three billion people die in 24 hours: Judgement Day.\nThis is a fundamentally different account to Reese's. In the first film, Skynet overinterprets its programming by deeming all of humanity a threat. In the second, it is acting out of self-interest. The contradiction does not trouble most viewers, but it does illustrate a crucial disagreement about the existential risk of AI.\nMore like this:• Avatar 2 and the future of visual effects• What Alien can tell us about office life• Why Star Wars shouldn't have sequels\nThe layperson is likely to imagine unaligned AI as rebellious and malevolent. But the likes of Nick Bostrom insist that the real danger is from careless programming. Think of the sorcerer's broom in Disney's Fantasia: a device that obediently follows its instructions to ruinous extremes. The second type of AI is not human enough it lacks common sense and moral judgement. The first is too human - selfish, resentful, power-hungry. Both could in theory be genocidal.\nThe Terminator therefore both helps and hinders our understanding of AI: what it means for a machine to \"think\", and how it could go horrifically wrong. Many AI researchers resent the Terminator obsession altogether for exaggerating the existential risk of AI at the expense of more immediate dangers such as mass unemployment, disinformation and autonomous weapons. \"First, it makes us worry about things that we probably don't need to fret about,\" writes Michael Woolridge. \"But secondly, it draws attention away from those issues raised by AI that we should be concerned about.\"\nCameron revealed to Empire that he is plotting a new Terminator film which will discard all the franchise's narrative baggage but retain the core idea of \"powerless\" humans versus AI. If it comes off, it will be fascinating to see what the director has to say about AI now that it is something we talk - and worry - about every day. Perhaps The Terminator's most useful message to AI researchers is that of \"will vs fate\": human decisions determine outcomes. Nothing is inevitable.\nDorian Lynskey is the author of Everything Must Go: The Stories We Tell About the End of the World (April 2024).\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

No, Pied Piper will in no way become sentient and try to take over the world.\" Too late. He's lost the room.\nWith its killer robots and its rogue AI system, Skynet, The Terminator has become synonymous with the spectre of a machine intelligence that turns against its human creators. Picture editors routinely illustrate articles about AI with the chrome death's head of the film's T-800 \"hunter-killer\" robot. The roboticist Ronald Arkin used clips from the film in a cautionary 2013 talk called How NOT to build a Terminator.\nBut the film is a mixed blessing. The philosopher Nick Bostrom, whose 2014 book Superintelligence popularised the existential risk of \"unaligned AI\" (AI that is not aligned with human values and wellbeing) admitted that his wife \"teases me about the Terminator and the robot army\". In his book The Road to Conscious Machines, AI researcher Michael Woolridge frames an entire chapter with a complaint about \"the Terminator narrative of AI\".\nThere are more recent, and more plausible, influential films about AI, including Ex Machina and Her, but when it comes to the dangers of the technology, The Terminator reigns supreme 40 years after its release. \"It's almost, in a funny way, more germane now than it was when it came out,\" Cameron told The Ringer about the film and its 1991 sequel, \"because AI is now a real thing that we have to deal with, and then it was a fantasy.\"\nThis is quite an achievement for a film that is not, in fact, particularly interested in AI. First and foremost, it is a lean and lurid thriller about an unstoppable \"man\" chasing a scared but resourceful woman. The T-800 is an implacable killer in the vein of Michael Myers from Halloween. Cameron called it \"a science-fiction slasher film\". Secondarily, it is a time-travel film on the theme of \"fate vs will\", as Cameron put it.\nThe briskly sketched premise is that at some point between 1984 and 2029, the US entrusted its entire defence system to Skynet. One day, Skynet achieved superintelligence – a mind of its own – and initiated a global nuclear war. Humanity's survivors then waged a decades-long rebellion against Skynet's robot army. By 2029, the human resistance is on the verge of victory thanks to the leadership of one John Connor, so Skynet dispatches a T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to 1984 to kill John's mother-to-be Sarah (Linda Hamilton) before she becomes pregnant. The resistance responds by sending back Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to stop the T-800 and save Sarah. In one of those time-loop paradoxes that viewers should not examine too closely, Kyle hooks up with Sarah and turns out to be John's father. The future is saved.\nThe Terminator, then, is a thriller, a love story, a time-hopping rumination on free will and a satire about our dependence on technology. It is anti-corporate, anti-war, anti-gun and largely anti-machine. Technology, from answering machines to Walkmans, is involved when people get killed in this film. But it has very little to say about AI itself.\nThe Terminator would become one of the most profitable films of all time, grossing $78.4m, but Cameron had no expectation of creating a cultural touchstone. He wrote the screenplay in a tatty hotel in Rome in 1982 after being fired from his first directing gig, Piranha II: The Spawning, and his producer Gale Ann Hurd could only rustle up a $6.4m budget. His lead actor, a former bodybuilder of unproven talent, did not have high hopes. Schwarzenegger told a friend about \"some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple of weeks\".\nCameron himself expected The Terminator to get \"stomped\" at the box office by the autumn's two sci-fi epics: David Lynch's Dune and Peter Hyams's 2010: The Year We Make Contact, a soon-forgotten sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey. There's an attractive synchronicity here: not only did The Terminator outperform 2010 but Skynet came to supplant 2001's murderous computer HAL 9000 as the dominant image of AI gone bad.\nLong before the field of AI existed, its potential dangers manifested in the form of the robot, created by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play RUR and popularised by Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis. In his excellent BFI book on The Terminator, Sean French suggests that the movie's most memorable image – the T-800 striding out of the flames, its suit of flesh melted away to expose its metallic endoskeleton – was a nod to the burning robot in Metropolis. In the 1920s, it stood to reason that machine intelligence would walk and talk, like Frankenstein's monster. The popularity of lethal robots led the science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, in 1942, to draw up the \"three laws of robotics\": the first ever attempt to define ethical AI.\nIn the real world, the field of artificial intelligence officially began in 1956 at a summer school at Dartmouth University, organised by computer scientists John McCarthy (who coined the term) and Marvin Minsky. Their ambition was to design machines that could think like humans, but this proved much harder than they had imagined. The history of AI is one of boom and bust: a cycle of so-called \"AI springs\" and \"AI winters\". Mindboggling promises attract attention, funding and talent; their failure to materialise causes all three to slump.\nThe boom of the 1960s, before the scale of the technical obstacles became apparent, is known as the Golden Age of AI. Extravagant hype about \"electronic brains\" excited director Stanley Kubrick and writer Arthur C Clarke, who integrated AI into 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey in the form of HAL 9000. The name (meaning Heuristically Programmed Algorithmic Computer) came from Minsky himself, hired as a consultant by Kubrick. The T-800's red eyes are surely a homage to HAL – seeing 2001 as a child set Cameron on the path to becoming a film-maker.\nDaniel Crevier, a historian of AI, contrasted the HAL scenario (poorly programmed computer goes awry) with the scenario in DF Jones's 1966 thriller Colossus (computer becomes a god-like new lifeform). In Jones's novel, the US government unwisely entrusts its entire defence machinery to the titular supercomputer. Colossus achieves sentience, joins forces with its Soviet counterpart and blackmails humanity into submitting to a techno-dictatorship: surrender or face nuclear annihilation. Colossus is a proto-Skynet.\nNeither HAL nor Colossus had – or needed – bodies. Cameron's brilliant innovation was to combine the out-of-control computer (Skynet) with the killer robot (the T-800). The T-800 is a single-purpose form of AI that can learn from its environment, solve problems, perform sophisticated physical tasks and deepfake voices, yet struggles to hold a conversation. Skynet, it seems, can do everything but move.\nSkynet was a product of the second AI spring. While Cameron was writing the screenplay, the British-Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton was rethinking and reviving research into the neural-net approach to AI: modelling machine intelligence on the neurons in the human brain. Skynet is neural-net AI. Hinton, who has just won the Nobel Prize for physics, has recently become an AI doomer (\"My intuition is: we're toast. This is the actual end of history\"), but according to a New Yorker profile, he enjoyed The Terminator in 1984: \"It didn't bother him that Skynet… was a neural net; he was pleased to see the technology portrayed as promising.\"\nThe name Skynet may also have been a nod to Star Wars, President Reagan's doomed dream of creating an anti-nuclear shield around the US with space-based lasers. (Fortunately for the franchise's future, it also inadvertently echoed the internet – a word that existed in 1984 but was not widely used until the 1990s.) The portmanteau names of ambitious new start-ups like IntelliCorp, Syntelligence and TeKnowledge possibly inspired Cameron to crunch down the original name of Skynet's creator, Cyber Dynamics Corporation, into Cyberdyne Systems.\nRewatching The Terminator now, it is surprising to find that the word Skynet is only uttered twice. According to Kyle Reese it was: \"New. Powerful. Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all. They say it got smart… a new order of intelligence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided our fate in a microsecond… extermination.\" That's the extent of the film's interest in AI. As Cameron has often said, the Terminator films are really about people rather than machines.\nThe blockbuster 1991 sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day filled out the story a little. It springs from another time paradox: the central processing unit and right arm of the original Terminator survived its destruction and enabled Cyberdyne scientist Miles Bennett Dyson (Joe Morton) to design Skynet. The heroes' task now is not just to save 10-year-old John Connor from the time-travelling T-1000 but to destroy Skynet in the digital cradle. (This was Cameron's last word on the subject until he produced and co-wrote 2019's Terminator: Dark Fate. He recently told Empire magazine that all the intervening sequels were \"discountable\".)\nIn Terminator 2, a Schwarzenegger-shaped T-800 is protector rather than hunter, and therefore the bearer of exposition: \"The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997. Human decisions are removed from strategic defence. Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate. It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29th. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.\" Skynet fights back by launching nuclear missiles at Russia, in the knowledge that the counter-attack will devastate the US. Three billion people die in 24 hours: Judgement Day.\nThis is a fundamentally different account to Reese's. In the first film, Skynet overinterprets its programming by deeming all of humanity a threat. In the second, it is acting out of self-interest. The contradiction does not trouble most viewers, but it does illustrate a crucial disagreement about the existential risk of AI.\nMore like this:• Avatar 2 and the future of visual effects• What Alien can tell us about office life• Why Star Wars shouldn't have sequels\nThe layperson is likely to imagine unaligned AI as rebellious and malevolent. But the likes of Nick Bostrom insist that the real danger is from careless programming. Think of the sorcerer's broom in Disney's Fantasia: a device that obediently follows its instructions to ruinous extremes. The second type of AI is not human enough it lacks common sense and moral judgement. The first is too human - selfish, resentful, power-hungry. Both could in theory be genocidal.\nThe Terminator therefore both helps and hinders our understanding of AI: what it means for a machine to \"think\", and how it could go horrifically wrong. Many AI researchers resent the Terminator obsession altogether for exaggerating the existential risk of AI at the expense of more immediate dangers such as mass unemployment, disinformation and autonomous weapons. \"First, it makes us worry about things that we probably don't need to fret about,\" writes Michael Woolridge. \"But secondly, it draws attention away from those issues raised by AI that we should be concerned about.\"\nCameron revealed to Empire that he is plotting a new Terminator film which will discard all the franchise's narrative baggage but retain the core idea of \"powerless\" humans versus AI. If it comes off, it will be fascinating to see what the director has to say about AI now that it is something we talk - and worry - about every day. Perhaps The Terminator's most useful message to AI researchers is that of \"will vs fate\": human decisions determine outcomes.

When she rebuilt her home in summer 2024, she wanted to keep this view.\nOn 30 December 2021, rapidly moving winds had carried hot flames across these plains to her neighbourhood in the Denver suburb of Superior, Colorado, destroying her home and nearly 1,000 others. Her husband, Matteo Rebeschini, and children were trapped in the front foyer for 30 minutes as their house burned, before escaping unharmed once the fire passed.\nThe fire brought trauma that lasts to this day, but Glover and Rebeschini were determined to rebuild. So they did – only this time, they used earth blocks.\n\"We want to be able to feel safe,\" says Glover. \"We wanted to build a house so that if something like this happens again, we have time.\"\nEarthen homes have a deep history throughout the world, from pit cave dwellings in northern China to the mud homes of Sana'a, Yemen. Indigenous communities in the south-western US states of Colorado and New Mexico used adobe, or \"mud brick\" in Spanish, to build earthen homes for thousands of years, using their thick walls to keep homes cool during hot summers and retain the sun's heat during cold winters.\nWhile earthen construction has been largely neglected by US builders for decades, the material has an increasingly relevant use in modern times. As climate change increases the risk of wildfires through the western US, homeowners like Glover are beginning to turn to it for a new reason: as a strategy to protect themselves from fire.\nTheir intuition is backed up by early research, which has found earthen homes could show extraordinary promise in resisting wildfires – and could even strengthen after exposure.\n\"Properly done and more historically done, an adobe house has a better chance of surviving a wildfire,\" says Quentin Wilson, a former volunteer firefighter and a board member of Adobe in Action, a non-profit based in Santa Fe, New Mexico which promotes building with earth.\nThat said, traditional adobe homes in New Mexico are hardly fireproof – they generally use protruding wooden beams called vigas, which can easily catch fire.\nBut when adobe homes are constructed with the threat of fire in mind, builders can eliminate things like exposed wood and air vents, often adding earthen beams or in some cases large planks of wood that don't protrude from the house. \"There's really nothing there that will ignite\", says Wilson. \"These are pretty much absolutely fireproof, flameproof materials.\"\nIn 2021, Michele Barbato, co-director of the Climate Adaptation Research Center at the University of California, Davis, and his students did a series of tests on compressed earth blocks, made at his testing area using soil mixed with water and chemical stabilisers. The researchers took a blowtorch to a compressed earth block at nearly 1,900C (3,452F), far hotter than an average wildfire. They also put a block in a 1,200C (2,192F) furnace.\nUpon exposure to heat, the blocks hardened and turned to red clay, similar to baking pottery in a kiln. More than just showing the earth blocks can withstand fire, the tests – which have been presented as a peer-reviewed conference paper but are not yet published in a journal – therefore indicate they strengthen after exposure. They perform just as well in dry climates, Barbato says, while in wet weather, they even improve, as the material hardens making it tougher for water to penetrate.\n\"Even if your house burns down, if the walls stay up, they are safe to be reused,\" he says.\nAt present, however, no houses made with these blocks have yet been put to the test with a fire, although a test has been conducted on a single wall.\nBut while it is early days for the research on earth bricks, some real-life examples do appear to indicate these houses could be capable of withstanding fire more than other buildings. When the Bobcat Fire swept through Littlerock, California in 2020, for example, the land around Stevie Love's earth home, built in 2008, was blackened by fire for miles around, but her home survived.\nA few years earlier, a fire crew prepared for another wildfire to potentially cross the hills behind their home. \"They described our house as a 'stand alone',\" Love says, meaning that if a fire came, its adobe walls and steel roof would protect it. \"They said the fast-moving fire would just blow by our house.\"\nAnd in 2016, in the Manzano Mountains of New Mexico, the Dog Head Fire burned through 18,000 acres (7,280 hectares) and destroyed 12 homes – but an old adobe church standing alongside them was left intact.\nFor Glover, an avid gardener, her inspiration to build from earth came from her garden.\nAfter the 2021 fire, she returned to her property and found flowerpots that had melted, leaving several unharmed piles of dirt behind. \"I said to myself, dirt doesn't burn,\" she recalls. \"We should build a house of dirt.\"\nGlover, who is from Northern Ireland, and her Italian husband were both used to earth and brick structures with thick walls from their home countries. \"It didn't scare me,\" she says. \"Whereas having a conventional stick-built American house scared me.\"\nNot long after the fire, Glover drove past a billboard advertising Colorado Earth, a Brighton, Colorado company making compressed earth blocks called EcoBlox from waste material sourced from a local quarry.\nLisa Morey, the founder and owner of Colorado Earth, has been building with earth blocks since 2000, when she came across the work of earth builder Vince Ogletree while studying architectural design in New Zealand.\nThe company's earth blocks are made by mixing dirt with limestone and water, then using a hydraulic press to compress them into solid blocks that are ready to use once they dry. Unlike bricks, they're made without being heated, dramatically reducing the embodied carbon used to produce each block, Morey says.\n\"[An EcoBlox wall is] an unfired structural masonry wall that's made from local materials,\" Morey says. \"It's resistant to mould, fire and bullets. And bugs don't like them.\"\nBarbato's work has also indicated that earth homes could lead to substantially fewer emissions if they do burn in wildfires, with another peer-reviewed conference paper finding earth block building results in 58% fewer emissions than light-frame wood buildings.\nTiny beads of perlite, a lightweight volcanic glass used for insulation, blow into Morey's hair as she walks around a construction site in the Denver suburb of Longmont when I visit in late September 2024. Here, a family is rebuilding a farm complex that was destroyed in a fire several years ago.\nMelanie MacKinnon says she and her husband had already been thinking of rebuilding when the fire happened. \"When we moved here, we had a plan for the farm,\" she says. \"After the fire, we realised that the farm has a plan for us.\"\nMacKinnon grew up in Santa Fe, New Mexico where adobe buildings are commonplace. \"I know what it's like to live inside of that,\" she said. \"We don't need air conditioning. It's fire resistant because it's not made out of timber.\"\nThe earth homes being constructed by Morey have additional features that prevent wildfires, designed to increase the odds a rapidly moving fire will pass without finding something to catch onto and ignite.\nGlover's completed home, for example, has thick, high-efficiency windows that, in a worst-case scenario, would take hours for fire to penetrate. There's a total absence of protruding roof vents, which can give flaming embers an avenue to get inside. Instead, there's a centralised ventilation system that can be closed in minutes when experiencing strong winds. \"Fire's not going to get into the gaps,\" she says. \"It's completely sealed.\"\nThese add to what already feels like an envelope of protection from the elements. \"My clients who live in these homes, they say that there could be an Armageddon going on outside and they wouldn't know,\" Morey says.\nGlover says windy days still bring traumatic memories of the fire that destroyed her previous home and took the lives of several pets. For weeks after the fire, she would lie awake imagining the destruction. \"It was just flames, flames, flames. It's horrible,\" she says. \"It's your home. It's like your sanctuary.\"\nAs she speaks, an impromptu windstorm sends strong gusts through her backyard, lashing her balcony and metal flower beds. But inside her living room, it barely makes a sound.\n\"That would be a lot more intense in a normal house, just so you know,\" Glover says.\nGlover knows that the house is not infallible. \"I have never said that this house is fireproof,\" she says. \"The blocks are fireproof. But… I can't live in a house without windows and [a] roof. And I've done the very best I possibly can.\"\nThere is still an uphill battle for more earth homes to be built throughout the United States, where fast-paced construction with environmentally unfriendly materials is normalised.\nSeveral of Glover's neighbours considered building earth homes after the 2021 fire. But they ultimately opted against it, spooked by the challenges of closely managing a project seen as eccentric by most builders.\nGlover kept costs down by serving as her own general contractor, meaning she and her husband were heavily involved in design decisions and engaging with builders.\nUltimately, their home cost around $280 (£210) per sq ft to build – more expensive than traditional homes in the community, which were built for around $250 (£188) per sq ft, Glover and Morey say, but less than many other green buildings.\nThe savings on utilities (due to higher energy efficiency) also bring costs down over time, though, says Glover.\nLabour costs, the bulk of the expense, could potentially be reduced with machines that mass produce earth blocks. The material itself ranges from free to cheap. Morey says she spends $4 (£3) for each tonne of dirt. \"And I can make about 100 bricks from that $4,\" she says.\nStill, earth builders can also be stopped in their tracks by bureaucracy, says Ryan Timmermans, a military veteran who founded Veterans Off-Grid, a non-profit providing assistance to veterans in need on a 50 acre (20 hectare) off-grid campus in Carson, New Mexico.\nTimmermans has constructed several earth buildings on the property, from small adobe huts to an Earthship, an off-grid structure built with walls of rammed earth and tires. These structures are designed to more effectively resist the winds that tear across the vast northern New Mexico plateau, he says. There is also a chance of wind carrying fire across a plateau.\nBut the wider construction industry has yet to adapt, from builders gaining more knowledge to insurers and mortgage lenders creating policies to accommodate earth homes.\n\"If a wildfire consumed it and there were trees all around, 60% of it would still be there,\" Timmermans said, pointing at the nearby Earthship. \"Why the hell is it more expensive to insure?\"\nMore like this: • The ancient material that cools homes• The houses built to survive floods• The homes that can weather category 5 hurricanes\nBarbato, the researcher, is part of a team working on a set of standards that would help local governments set codes for earth building in the US.\nSome earth builders mix dirt with binders such as cement to make them stronger, as they \"have been pushed by standards and codes to really treat them as bricks\", he says. \"And that's not really the right way of using this material.\"\nInstead, the dirt can be stabilised with \"a proper composition between clay, silt and sand\" Barbato says, which also gives earth blocks the breathability that either sucks in or releases humidity, keeping a home from ever getting too hot or too cold.\nWith the proper codes in place, \"we can bring the cost of an earthen home lower than the cost of a wooden home\", Barbato says, citing a study he co-authored in 2018 evaluating an earth wall technology his team is currently developing.\nHe believes this will clear a major obstacle to widespread earth construction: familiarising people with it.

When she rebuilt her home in summer 2024, she wanted to keep this view.\nOn 30 December 2021, rapidly moving winds had carried hot flames across these plains to her neighbourhood in the Denver suburb of Superior, Colorado, destroying her home and nearly 1,000 others. Her husband, Matteo Rebeschini, and children were trapped in the front foyer for 30 minutes as their house burned, before escaping unharmed once the fire passed.\nThe fire brought trauma that lasts to this day, but Glover and Rebeschini were determined to rebuild. So they did – only this time, they used earth blocks.\n\"We want to be able to feel safe,\" says Glover. \"We wanted to build a house so that if something like this happens again, we have time.\"\nEarthen homes have a deep history throughout the world, from pit cave dwellings in northern China to the mud homes of Sana'a, Yemen. Indigenous communities in the south-western US states of Colorado and New Mexico used adobe, or \"mud brick\" in Spanish, to build earthen homes for thousands of years, using their thick walls to keep homes cool during hot summers and retain the sun's heat during cold winters.\nWhile earthen construction has been largely neglected by US builders for decades, the material has an increasingly relevant use in modern times. As climate change increases the risk of wildfires through the western US, homeowners like Glover are beginning to turn to it for a new reason: as a strategy to protect themselves from fire.\nTheir intuition is backed up by early research, which has found earthen homes could show extraordinary promise in resisting wildfires – and could even strengthen after exposure.\n\"Properly done and more historically done, an adobe house has a better chance of surviving a wildfire,\" says Quentin Wilson, a former volunteer firefighter and a board member of Adobe in Action, a non-profit based in Santa Fe, New Mexico which promotes building with earth.\nThat said, traditional adobe homes in New Mexico are hardly fireproof – they generally use protruding wooden beams called vigas, which can easily catch fire.\nBut when adobe homes are constructed with the threat of fire in mind, builders can eliminate things like exposed wood and air vents, often adding earthen beams or in some cases large planks of wood that don't protrude from the house. \"There's really nothing there that will ignite\", says Wilson. \"These are pretty much absolutely fireproof, flameproof materials.\"\nIn 2021, Michele Barbato, co-director of the Climate Adaptation Research Center at the University of California, Davis, and his students did a series of tests on compressed earth blocks, made at his testing area using soil mixed with water and chemical stabilisers. The researchers took a blowtorch to a compressed earth block at nearly 1,900C (3,452F), far hotter than an average wildfire. They also put a block in a 1,200C (2,192F) furnace.\nUpon exposure to heat, the blocks hardened and turned to red clay, similar to baking pottery in a kiln. More than just showing the earth blocks can withstand fire, the tests – which have been presented as a peer-reviewed conference paper but are not yet published in a journal – therefore indicate they strengthen after exposure. They perform just as well in dry climates, Barbato says, while in wet weather, they even improve, as the material hardens making it tougher for water to penetrate.\n\"Even if your house burns down, if the walls stay up, they are safe to be reused,\" he says.\nAt present, however, no houses made with these blocks have yet been put to the test with a fire, although a test has been conducted on a single wall.\nBut while it is early days for the research on earth bricks, some real-life examples do appear to indicate these houses could be capable of withstanding fire more than other buildings.

Young and Hsiang’s research is the first to suggest that hurricanes are an important driver for the distribution of overall mortality risk across the country.", "An outsized proportion of low-income and historically-disadvantaged communities in the United States reside in tropical cyclone-affected areas; understanding the public health consequences of climate-related disasters such as hurricanes and other tropical cyclones is an essential component of environmental justice.", "Climate change is worsening hurricane impacts in the United States by increasing the intensity and decreasing the speed at which they travel. Scientists are currently uncertain whether there will be a change in the number of hurricanes, but they are certain that the intensity and severity of hurricanes will continue to increase.", "Disease-causing microorganisms churn in the floodwaters after a hurricane and grow in people's homes long after the first danger has passed. But knowing when to seek medical attention can help limit the spread of disease after a storm.\nOver the last seven years, Naresh Kumar and colleagues at the University of Miami have been steadily collecting data on hurricanes, from Maria in 2017 to Irma, Ian, Michael, Dorian and now the recent Hurricanes Helene and Milton, deadly storms which have all inflicted billions of dollars of havoc on the US.\nBut their focus was not on the damage to infrastructure wreaked by the storms, or the lives lost during the storm surge. Instead, they were focused on something far more subtle, and yet still deadly – how such natural disasters can fuel a whole plethora of infectious diseases.\nThis has been spotlighted by the recent aftermath of Hurricane Helene which hit Florida with storm surges and winds of up to 225km/h (140mph) before triggering flooding and landslides in western North Carolina. Florida health authorities released a warning in early October of a likely spike in Vibrio vulnificus infections, urging residents to avoid wading in floodwaters.  \nVibrio vulnificus is a bacteria which can cause the breakdown of skin and soft tissue, sometimes leading to amputations. According to the latest data, 77 cases and 15 deaths have been reported so far in 2024, the most recorded cases in the past decade, though it is not known how many of cases were reported since Helene and Milton. In 2022, Florida reported an unusual increase in Vibrio vulnificus infections in the wake of Hurricane Ian.\n\"Vibrio prefers warmer waters, and hurricanes typically occur during times when the water is warmest,\" says John Drake, director of the centre for the ecology of infectious diseases at the University of Georgia. \"Flooding associated with hurricanes could very well lead to a redistribution of Vibrio further inland, and it goes without saying that there is increased human exposure to contaminated water when a hurricane hits.\"\nEvery year, the impacts of tropical cyclones – defined as storm systems with winds exceeding 119km/h (74mph) – affect an estimated 150 million people around the world, mostly located in coastal communities. These storms encompass hurricanes which occur in the North Atlantic Ocean and Northeast Pacific, typhoons which form in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, and cyclones which begin in the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean.\nWith some forecasts suggesting that the intensity of tropical cyclones will grow with rising ocean temperatures, understanding the full breadth of these storms' impact on disease is becoming increasingly urgent.\n\"We have been studying hurricanes for a while now and there are different pathways through which infectious diseases are exacerbated, mostly contaminated food, contaminated water and an increase in environmental pathogens,\" says Kumar.\nOne of the biggest impacts of hurricanes and other tropical cyclones is thought to be gastrointestinal infections, with communities in the storm's path becoming exposed to the kind of diseases which might traditionally be associated with extreme poverty. Studies have found that hurricanes have caused spates of cholera across the American coastal south, while a 2023 study noted that typhoons in Taiwan had led to an increased burden of intestinal diseases, and infections which later progressed to sepsis.\nAccording to Kumar, the reason for this is because extreme storms cause an enormous displacement of water, with storm surges raising the water level by 6m (19.7ft) or more, overwhelming or destroying sewage infrastructure, as well as introducing animal waste from farms into the water supply. If such pathogens work their way into rivers, they can then travel hundreds of miles.\n\"A certain amount of microbial contamination happens via these routes even through ordinary rainfall,\" says Kumar. \"There's a programme in Florida called Healthy Beaches which shows that the concentrations of bacteria found in human waste jumps whenever there's a significant amount of rain.\"\nMore like this:• The destructive power of Hurricane Milton in 3 images• How zoos protect animals when a hurricane hits• Why mosquitoes are thriving in a warmer world\nThe sheer force of the winds can disperse pathogenic bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms many kilometres into the atmosphere. A specialised aircraft developed by Nasa discovered that a large number of bacteria and fungi had been dispersed to heights of up to 10,000m (33,000ft) by hurricanes Earl and Karl, severe storms which formed in August and September 2010. Together they affected the Atlantic coastlines of North and Central America stretching from Eastern Canada down to Mexico.\nDrake says that such discoveries have already forced some municipalities with large sewage treatment facilities to develop emergency contingency plans to deal with hurricanes. Farms have had to adapt too.\n\"After Hurricane Floyd hit eastern North Carolina in 1999, the resulting flooding and rupture of swine lagoons [where pig manure is stored] led to a public health decree that changed how swine lagoons are built and managed,\" he says. \"I think that the consequences of the atmospheric dispersion of such microorganisms needs much more attention.\"\nOnce the floodwaters recede, the recovery and rebuilding process can begin. However, microbiologists are increasingly realising that an often-overlooked public health threat is the stagnant water left behind pooling in gardens, parts of the home and farmland, creating an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes.\nNumerous studies have shown that the incidence of viral diseases such as West Nile, Zika, dengue and chikungunya, which are spread by mosquitoes, tends to increase in the aftermath of a hurricane. West Nile cases rose in Louisiana and Mississippi following Hurricane Katrina, dengue cases reportedly increased in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Fiona and the risk of contracting Zika rose in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew. While malaria has rarely been considered a public health threat in Canada, there are growing concerns that hurricanes hitting Canada's eastern border may be contributing to the rise of the disease in the south of the country.\n\"Having these standing water sources can change some of the dynamics in the local ecosystem in terms of the number of insects present,\" says Kimberly Davis, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland.\nIndoor flooding can also allow moulds to flourish, with even small leaks capable of inducing fungal growth in ventilation and air conditioning systems, affecting the air quality within homes, compromising breathing and aggravating the immune system. Studies found that flooding in Louisiana following hurricanes Rita and Katrina led to an increase in the airborne fungi Penicillium and Aspergillus, which can cause allergies, respiratory infections and pneumonia.\nKumar tells the BBC that new, currently unpublished data from his research into the aftermath of hurricanes Maria, Irma and Michael, shows that a significant number of people in Florida developed new chronic health conditions such as asthma and allergies in the six months following the disasters, something which he suspects to have been triggered by the spread of moulds. He has also found that existing asthma patients can experience an acute exacerbation or an asthma attack in the immediate aftermath, and their symptoms worsen.\n\"In Florida, the Sun is still quite strong during hurricane season, through September and October, and water evaporates, and become airborne,\" says Kumar. \"Because of this, you have a constant airborne concentration of more fungi in the air.\" Repairing damaged homes often takes precedence over seeking medical attention for their coughing and sneezing, Kumar says.\nKumar says that the long-term consequences of this for public health are often underestimated. \"If you'd never previously been exposed to severe concentrations of black mould inside the home, and now you're chronically exposed to this, you could have allergies or asthma for the rest of your life and it might be life-threatening,\" he says. He remembers one case study after Hurricane Ian \"where someone ended up staying in a mould-infected home and dying two or three months after the hurricane made landfall\".\nIn some cases, the sheer amount of damage to healthcare infrastructure also limits access to medical care, especially for conditions deemed non-life threatening, with power outages and flooding forcing hospitals and pharmacies to close. In New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, three major hospitals were surrounded by floodwater and remained closed for several months.\nBut not everyone in society faces the same level of risk. Gina Charnley, a global health researcher at Imperial College London, says that infectious diseases in the aftermath of natural disasters tend to disproportionately affect those in poverty.\n\"Following disasters, people who have the means and ability to move away from these risks tend to not get sick, and those who can't such as the elderly, pregnant women, or children, are the ones who most often get sick,\" she says. \"Many infectious diseases globally could be reduced if we lift people out of poverty, but we have a long history of inaction on this.\"\nBoth Davis and Kumar believe that more needs to be done when it comes to identifying areas at the greatest risk in the aftermath of severe storms, and preventing, identifying and treating infections.\n\"There is a lot which we could do,\" says Kumar. \"Mobile healthcare delivery systems at every single place where we anticipate people will congregate, including evacuation centres. You have to come to the affected communities where people might be at risk because otherwise they might not seek care and perish because of that. This is not only government responsibility, but of all healthcare providers, public and private.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X and Instagram."]}

But knowing when to seek medical attention can help limit the spread of disease after a storm.\nOver the last seven years, Naresh Kumar and colleagues at the University of Miami have been steadily collecting data on hurricanes, from Maria in 2017 to Irma, Ian, Michael, Dorian and now the recent Hurricanes Helene and Milton, deadly storms which have all inflicted billions of dollars of havoc on the US.\nBut their focus was not on the damage to infrastructure wreaked by the storms, or the lives lost during the storm surge. Instead, they were focused on something far more subtle, and yet still deadly – how such natural disasters can fuel a whole plethora of infectious diseases.\nThis has been spotlighted by the recent aftermath of Hurricane Helene which hit Florida with storm surges and winds of up to 225km/h (140mph) before triggering flooding and landslides in western North Carolina. Florida health authorities released a warning in early October of a likely spike in Vibrio vulnificus infections, urging residents to avoid wading in floodwaters.  \nVibrio vulnificus is a bacteria which can cause the breakdown of skin and soft tissue, sometimes leading to amputations. According to the latest data, 77 cases and 15 deaths have been reported so far in 2024, the most recorded cases in the past decade, though it is not known how many of cases were reported since Helene and Milton. In 2022, Florida reported an unusual increase in Vibrio vulnificus infections in the wake of Hurricane Ian.\n\"Vibrio prefers warmer waters, and hurricanes typically occur during times when the water is warmest,\" says John Drake, director of the centre for the ecology of infectious diseases at the University of Georgia. \"Flooding associated with hurricanes could very well lead to a redistribution of Vibrio further inland, and it goes without saying that there is increased human exposure to contaminated water when a hurricane hits.\"\nEvery year, the impacts of tropical cyclones – defined as storm systems with winds exceeding 119km/h (74mph) – affect an estimated 150 million people around the world, mostly located in coastal communities. These storms encompass hurricanes which occur in the North Atlantic Ocean and Northeast Pacific, typhoons which form in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, and cyclones which begin in the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean.\nWith some forecasts suggesting that the intensity of tropical cyclones will grow with rising ocean temperatures, understanding the full breadth of these storms' impact on disease is becoming increasingly urgent.\n\"We have been studying hurricanes for a while now and there are different pathways through which infectious diseases are exacerbated, mostly contaminated food, contaminated water and an increase in environmental pathogens,\" says Kumar.\nOne of the biggest impacts of hurricanes and other tropical cyclones is thought to be gastrointestinal infections, with communities in the storm's path becoming exposed to the kind of diseases which might traditionally be associated with extreme poverty. Studies have found that hurricanes have caused spates of cholera across the American coastal south, while a 2023 study noted that typhoons in Taiwan had led to an increased burden of intestinal diseases, and infections which later progressed to sepsis.\nAccording to Kumar, the reason for this is because extreme storms cause an enormous displacement of water, with storm surges raising the water level by 6m (19.7ft) or more, overwhelming or destroying sewage infrastructure, as well as introducing animal waste from farms into the water supply. If such pathogens work their way into rivers, they can then travel hundreds of miles.\n\"A certain amount of microbial contamination happens via these routes even through ordinary rainfall,\" says Kumar. \"There's a programme in Florida called Healthy Beaches which shows that the concentrations of bacteria found in human waste jumps whenever there's a significant amount of rain.\"\nMore like this:• The destructive power of Hurricane Milton in 3 images• How zoos protect animals when a hurricane hits• Why mosquitoes are thriving in a warmer world\nThe sheer force of the winds can disperse pathogenic bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms many kilometres into the atmosphere. A specialised aircraft developed by Nasa discovered that a large number of bacteria and fungi had been dispersed to heights of up to 10,000m (33,000ft) by hurricanes Earl and Karl, severe storms which formed in August and September 2010. Together they affected the Atlantic coastlines of North and Central America stretching from Eastern Canada down to Mexico.\nDrake says that such discoveries have already forced some municipalities with large sewage treatment facilities to develop emergency contingency plans to deal with hurricanes. Farms have had to adapt too.\n\"After Hurricane Floyd hit eastern North Carolina in 1999, the resulting flooding and rupture of swine lagoons [where pig manure is stored] led to a public health decree that changed how swine lagoons are built and managed,\" he says. \"I think that the consequences of the atmospheric dispersion of such microorganisms needs much more attention.\"\nOnce the floodwaters recede, the recovery and rebuilding process can begin. However, microbiologists are increasingly realising that an often-overlooked public health threat is the stagnant water left behind pooling in gardens, parts of the home and farmland, creating an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes.\nNumerous studies have shown that the incidence of viral diseases such as West Nile, Zika, dengue and chikungunya, which are spread by mosquitoes, tends to increase in the aftermath of a hurricane. West Nile cases rose in Louisiana and Mississippi following Hurricane Katrina, dengue cases reportedly increased in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Fiona and the risk of contracting Zika rose in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew. While malaria has rarely been considered a public health threat in Canada, there are growing concerns that hurricanes hitting Canada's eastern border may be contributing to the rise of the disease in the south of the country.\n\"Having these standing water sources can change some of the dynamics in the local ecosystem in terms of the number of insects present,\" says Kimberly Davis, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland.\nIndoor flooding can also allow moulds to flourish, with even small leaks capable of inducing fungal growth in ventilation and air conditioning systems, affecting the air quality within homes, compromising breathing and aggravating the immune system. Studies found that flooding in Louisiana following hurricanes Rita and Katrina led to an increase in the airborne fungi Penicillium and Aspergillus, which can cause allergies, respiratory infections and pneumonia.\nKumar tells the BBC that new, currently unpublished data from his research into the aftermath of hurricanes Maria, Irma and Michael, shows that a significant number of people in Florida developed new chronic health conditions such as asthma and allergies in the six months following the disasters, something which he suspects to have been triggered by the spread of moulds. He has also found that existing asthma patients can experience an acute exacerbation or an asthma attack in the immediate aftermath, and their symptoms worsen.\n\"In Florida, the Sun is still quite strong during hurricane season, through September and October, and water evaporates, and become airborne,\" says Kumar. \"Because of this, you have a constant airborne concentration of more fungi in the air.\" Repairing damaged homes often takes precedence over seeking medical attention for their coughing and sneezing, Kumar says.\nKumar says that the long-term consequences of this for public health are often underestimated. \"If you'd never previously been exposed to severe concentrations of black mould inside the home, and now you're chronically exposed to this, you could have allergies or asthma for the rest of your life and it might be life-threatening,\" he says. He remembers one case study after Hurricane Ian \"where someone ended up staying in a mould-infected home and dying two or three months after the hurricane made landfall\".\nIn some cases, the sheer amount of damage to healthcare infrastructure also limits access to medical care, especially for conditions deemed non-life threatening, with power outages and flooding forcing hospitals and pharmacies to close. In New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, three major hospitals were surrounded by floodwater and remained closed for several months.\nBut not everyone in society faces the same level of risk. Gina Charnley, a global health researcher at Imperial College London, says that infectious diseases in the aftermath of natural disasters tend to disproportionately affect those in poverty.\n\"Following disasters, people who have the means and ability to move away from these risks tend to not get sick, and those who can't such as the elderly, pregnant women, or children, are the ones who most often get sick,\" she says. \"Many infectious diseases globally could be reduced if we lift people out of poverty, but we have a long history of inaction on this.\"\nBoth Davis and Kumar believe that more needs to be done when it comes to identifying areas at the greatest risk in the aftermath of severe storms, and preventing, identifying and treating infections.\n\"There is a lot which we could do,\" says Kumar. \"Mobile healthcare delivery systems at every single place where we anticipate people will congregate, including evacuation centres. You have to come to the affected communities where people might be at risk because otherwise they might not seek care and perish because of that.

Studies have found that hurricanes have caused spates of cholera across the American coastal south, while a 2023 study noted that typhoons in Taiwan had led to an increased burden of intestinal diseases, and infections which later progressed to sepsis.\nAccording to Kumar, the reason for this is because extreme storms cause an enormous displacement of water, with storm surges raising the water level by 6m (19.7ft) or more, overwhelming or destroying sewage infrastructure, as well as introducing animal waste from farms into the water supply. If such pathogens work their way into rivers, they can then travel hundreds of miles.\n\"A certain amount of microbial contamination happens via these routes even through ordinary rainfall,\" says Kumar. \"There's a programme in Florida called Healthy Beaches which shows that the concentrations of bacteria found in human waste jumps whenever there's a significant amount of rain.\"\nMore like this:• The destructive power of Hurricane Milton in 3 images• How zoos protect animals when a hurricane hits• Why mosquitoes are thriving in a warmer world\nThe sheer force of the winds can disperse pathogenic bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms many kilometres into the atmosphere. A specialised aircraft developed by Nasa discovered that a large number of bacteria and fungi had been dispersed to heights of up to 10,000m (33,000ft) by hurricanes Earl and Karl, severe storms which formed in August and September 2010. Together they affected the Atlantic coastlines of North and Central America stretching from Eastern Canada down to Mexico.\nDrake says that such discoveries have already forced some municipalities with large sewage treatment facilities to develop emergency contingency plans to deal with hurricanes. Farms have had to adapt too.\n\"After Hurricane Floyd hit eastern North Carolina in 1999, the resulting flooding and rupture of swine lagoons [where pig manure is stored] led to a public health decree that changed how swine lagoons are built and managed,\" he says. \"I think that the consequences of the atmospheric dispersion of such microorganisms needs much more attention.\"\nOnce the floodwaters recede, the recovery and rebuilding process can begin. However, microbiologists are increasingly realising that an often-overlooked public health threat is the stagnant water left behind pooling in gardens, parts of the home and farmland, creating an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes.\nNumerous studies have shown that the incidence of viral diseases such as West Nile, Zika, dengue and chikungunya, which are spread by mosquitoes, tends to increase in the aftermath of a hurricane. West Nile cases rose in Louisiana and Mississippi following Hurricane Katrina, dengue cases reportedly increased in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Fiona and the risk of contracting Zika rose in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew. While malaria has rarely been considered a public health threat in Canada, there are growing concerns that hurricanes hitting Canada's eastern border may be contributing to the rise of the disease in the south of the country.\n\"Having these standing water sources can change some of the dynamics in the local ecosystem in terms of the number of insects present,\" says Kimberly Davis, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland.\nIndoor flooding can also allow moulds to flourish, with even small leaks capable of inducing fungal growth in ventilation and air conditioning systems, affecting the air quality within homes, compromising breathing and aggravating the immune system. Studies found that flooding in Louisiana following hurricanes Rita and Katrina led to an increase in the airborne fungi Penicillium and Aspergillus, which can cause allergies, respiratory infections and pneumonia.\nKumar tells the BBC that new, currently unpublished data from his research into the aftermath of hurricanes Maria, Irma and Michael, shows that a significant number of people in Florida developed new chronic health conditions such as asthma and allergies in the six months following the disasters, something which he suspects to have been triggered by the spread of moulds. He has also found that existing asthma patients can experience an acute exacerbation or an asthma attack in the immediate aftermath, and their symptoms worsen.\n\"In Florida, the Sun is still quite strong during hurricane season, through September and October, and water evaporates, and become airborne,\" says Kumar. \"Because of this, you have a constant airborne concentration of more fungi in the air.\" Repairing damaged homes often takes precedence over seeking medical attention for their coughing and sneezing, Kumar says.\nKumar says that the long-term consequences of this for public health are often underestimated. \"If you'd never previously been exposed to severe concentrations of black mould inside the home, and now you're chronically exposed to this, you could have allergies or asthma for the rest of your life and it might be life-threatening,\" he says. He remembers one case study after Hurricane Ian \"where someone ended up staying in a mould-infected home and dying two or three months after the hurricane made landfall\".\nIn some cases, the sheer amount of damage to healthcare infrastructure also limits access to medical care, especially for conditions deemed non-life threatening, with power outages and flooding forcing hospitals and pharmacies to close. In New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, three major hospitals were surrounded by floodwater and remained closed for several months.\nBut not everyone in society faces the same level of risk. Gina Charnley, a global health researcher at Imperial College London, says that infectious diseases in the aftermath of natural disasters tend to disproportionately affect those in poverty.\n\"Following disasters, people who have the means and ability to move away from these risks tend to not get sick, and those who can't such as the elderly, pregnant women, or children, are the ones who most often get sick,\" she says. \"Many infectious diseases globally could be reduced if we lift people out of poverty, but we have a long history of inaction on this.\"\nBoth Davis and Kumar believe that more needs to be done when it comes to identifying areas at the greatest risk in the aftermath of severe storms, and preventing, identifying and treating infections.\n\"There is a lot which we could do,\" says Kumar. \"Mobile healthcare delivery systems at every single place where we anticipate people will congregate, including evacuation centres. You have to come to the affected communities where people might be at risk because otherwise they might not seek care and perish because of that.

But knowing when to seek medical attention can help limit the spread of disease after a storm.\nOver the last seven years, Naresh Kumar and colleagues at the University of Miami have been steadily collecting data on hurricanes, from Maria in 2017 to Irma, Ian, Michael, Dorian and now the recent Hurricanes Helene and Milton, deadly storms which have all inflicted billions of dollars of havoc on the US.\nBut their focus was not on the damage to infrastructure wreaked by the storms, or the lives lost during the storm surge. Instead, they were focused on something far more subtle, and yet still deadly – how such natural disasters can fuel a whole plethora of infectious diseases.\nThis has been spotlighted by the recent aftermath of Hurricane Helene which hit Florida with storm surges and winds of up to 225km/h (140mph) before triggering flooding and landslides in western North Carolina. Florida health authorities released a warning in early October of a likely spike in Vibrio vulnificus infections, urging residents to avoid wading in floodwaters.  \nVibrio vulnificus is a bacteria which can cause the breakdown of skin and soft tissue, sometimes leading to amputations. According to the latest data, 77 cases and 15 deaths have been reported so far in 2024, the most recorded cases in the past decade, though it is not known how many of cases were reported since Helene and Milton. In 2022, Florida reported an unusual increase in Vibrio vulnificus infections in the wake of Hurricane Ian.\n\"Vibrio prefers warmer waters, and hurricanes typically occur during times when the water is warmest,\" says John Drake, director of the centre for the ecology of infectious diseases at the University of Georgia. \"Flooding associated with hurricanes could very well lead to a redistribution of Vibrio further inland, and it goes without saying that there is increased human exposure to contaminated water when a hurricane hits.\"\nEvery year, the impacts of tropical cyclones – defined as storm systems with winds exceeding 119km/h (74mph) – affect an estimated 150 million people around the world, mostly located in coastal communities.

The creature was ripping off chunks of the pig's flesh and swallowing them whole – slowly gulping them into its pale, distended body.\n\"It wasn't [exactly] a 400-pound (181kg) pig, but it was a pig for a big party,\" says Rogers, an associate professor in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation at Virginia Tech in the US, who has been studying Guam's ecology for the last 22 years.\nThe visitor without table manners was a brown tree snake – an alien invader which is thought to have been inadvertently introduced to Guam in the 1940s, perhaps after sneaking onto a cargo ship. Before this, an abundance of native birds had enjoyed an idyllic existence in the island's otherworldly limestone forests. But within just four decades of the snake's debut, these voracious predators had begun emptying the jungle of every single one. Out of 12 species, 10 are now extinct on the island, while the remaining two are clinging on in inaccessible caves and urban areas.\nNow that the avian community has been virtually wiped out, Guam's population of some two million snakes – no one really knows how many there are – will hoover up whatever they can find, including rats, shrews, lizards, or, on this occasion, human leftovers.\n\"I mean, they'll eat anything,\" says Henry Pollock, executive director of the Southern Plains Land Trust, a non-profit in Colorado, who has previously studied the ecology of Guam. \"They'll eat each other.\"\nWith a plague of ravenous snakes, and forests that are entirely devoid of the friendly whistles, chirps and caws that once dominated their soundscape, Guam has become notorious as one of the planet's most spectacular ecological debacles. But the consequences of the island's snake infestation extend far beyond its eerily silent, bird-less forests. Here, an evolutionary experiment is unfolding. And one notable beneficiary has eight legs, plenty of eyes – and the good luck to find itself on an island where sharp, hungry beaks are little more than a distant memory.\nRogers is not frightened of spiders – and that's just as well.\nOn most of the Mariana Islands, there are relatively few spiders in the rainy season, with a large spike as the climate dries out. But not on Guam. The island's limestone forests are an arachno-nightmare all year round – a near-continuous tangle of silvery threads that stretches for miles, where every step you take reveals another web and its hairy host.\nThere are giant, yellow-bellied banana spiders, with their golden webs in the classic spoked style; scuttling huntsman spiders the size of a human hand; tent-web spiders, which drape their vast pavilions of silk across gaps in the trees. Rogers calls the latter kind the \"condo\" web, because each one is akin to an apartment complex for creatures with eight legs – they contain hundreds of gleaming eyes, belonging to tens of individual spiders.\n\"You'll have many females at different levels in this massive web, and then many males hanging around and the edges,\" says Rogers. These communal webs are also a favourite of tiny Argyrodes spiders, who turn up to steal prey from, and occasionally eat, their much larger hosts. \"On Guam these [condo webs] go from ground level, all the way up to the canopy – they can be everywhere,\" she says.\nMost of the time, the whole forest looks like it's been draped in wisps of artificial spider's web for Halloween. \"It's enough that when you're hiking, it's common for the person in front to pick up a spider stick and knock down the webs as they go,\" says Rogers, \"otherwise you'll be covered in spider webs… I love it, but it is difficult to get through.\"\nWherever there is a gap in the trees, the entire space will be filled with webs from hundreds of different spiders, all catching the light at different angles. These collective efforts can easily occupy a space the size of a room. \"I had a friend once who ran into the middle of one and just twirled in a circle, making a mummy out of himself with this massive bit of web,\" says Rogers,\" he did that to freak out the people he was with\".\nOn another occasion, an assistant of Rogers volunteered to help in the field – only to get a couple of metres into the forest and change her mind. \"She was like, 'No, I'm out',\" says Rogers.\nEven without the spiders, which in the native Chamorro language are known as sånye'ye', Guam's limestone forests would be a strange and hostile place, like nowhere else.\nOverhead, towering breadfruit trees mingle with the Jurassic shapes of cycads, along with tangantangan (castor-oil) and spiky pandanus trees, forming a low canopy of jungle which is frequently ripped up by typhoons. On the ground, there is very little soil. Instead, plants grow directly out of limestone karst, forcing their roots into tiny fissures in the rock – the forest sits atop an ancient coral reef which has been pushed up over millions of years to form a plateau. Coral heads still litter the forest floor, and where the rock has eroded away, there are sinkholes and caves.\n\"I think the unique thing is, just like, it's really difficult to walk because – well, imagine walking on sharp rocks,\" says Rogers. When she takes new field technicians out for surveys, they need time to acclimatise to this rocky ground – she talks about people getting their \"karst legs\". \"It's like getting your sea legs – being able to walk without having to focus on every step,\" she says.\nSo, when Rogers decided to take a survey of the number of spiders in 2012, she knew it would be a challenge.\nThere had always been rumours that Guam was particularly spidery – and that this might have something to do with the absence of birds, which ordinarily love to eat them. However, Rogers explains that the island's population of roughly 180,000 people rarely travel to the other Northern Mariana Islands – while they are all part of a self-governing commonwealth, only Guam is a US territory. As a result, there is little opportunity for comparison. And scientists had never actually checked.\nTo find out exactly how many arachnids had taken over Guam, Rogers and colleagues set about completing transect surveys in the island's forests. For these, researchers carefully picked their way over the jagged coral reef underfoot while unspooling a roll of tape in a straight line. As they went. they carefully counted the spider's webs in their path which still contained a fanged occupant, if they fell within a metre of the line.\nWhat the scientists found was a population of arachno-spectacular proportions: during the wet season, there were 40 times more spiders in Guam's forests than there were on the nearby islands of Rota, Tinian and Saipan – while in the dry season, when spider populations in the region usually escalate, there were 2.3 times more spiders on Guam. The webs of banana spiders on Guam were also around 50% bigger.\nAll year round, Guam's forests were positively glistening with webs: the team found 1.8 and 2.6 webs per metre of transect line in the wet seasons and dry seasons respectively. If extrapolated to Guam's entire forest area this would amount to between 508 and 733 million spiders in total, scampering around on their webs and sucking the juices out of their victims. That's assuming one spider per web, though there are often far more – and only counting those living within two metres of the ground. In terms of spidery body parts, the forest ends up hosting at least 4,064,000,000 eyes and an equal number of hairy, articulated legs. \nRota, Tinian and Saipan are free of brown tree snakes and still have healthy bird populations, so the study suggests that Guam's spider population might once have been unremarkable – before exploding over the last few decades, in the absence of birds. This is partly because of the avian predilection for creatures with eight legs, and also because they compete for the spiders' insect prey – and it fits with research conducted in the Bahamas, which has found that spiders are about 10 times more abundant on islands without lizards.\nSince the brown tree snake's arrival, the banana spider's existence on Guam has become so comfortable, they have even stopped adding \"stabilimenta\" to their webs. It's not known why spiders add these mysterious decorations, which usually involve zig-zag patterns made from opaque white threads. One idea is that they warn birds of the web's presence, preventing them from accidentally flying into them – and this is backed up by the feature's unusually low frequency on bird-less Guam.  \nThough brown tree snakes are thought to have been shifting the balance of Guam's ecosystems since they were introduced shortly after World War Two, this went largely undetected for at least four decades. By the late 1980s, ecologists had noticed that something was wiping out the island's birds – but no one had any idea what.\nJulie Savidge, who was a PhD student at the time, decided to track down this mystery killer, which was suspected to be either a pesticide or a virus. Her research – published in 1987 – revealed that it was, in fact, down to the snakes. As island species, most of Guam's birds had no evolutionary programming that could help them to avoid the reptiles' insatiable appetite for poultry – there are no native snakes, so their ancestors were equally clueless. Consequently, when the predators arrived they found an all-you-can-eat buffet of defenceless birds which quickly became dinner.\nBy the time Savidge had worked out what was going on, for most avian species it was already too late. The Guam flycatcher was last seen in the wild in 1984, and this wide-eyed little ball of feathers is now considered extinct. Others have had a narrow escape.\nThe lurid ginger and iridescent green Guam kingfisher was considered extinct in the wild until earlier this year, when nine captive individuals were introduced to the Palmyra Atoll, some 5,879 km (3,653 miles) away from their natural home. The Guam rail, a flightless bird known locally as the Ko'ko', was also once listed as extinct in the wild. Today their reddish-brown bodies and houndstooth bellies can be seen scurrying around Rota and the Cocos islands, where they have been introduced.\nBut only in recent years have researchers begun to uncover the true scale of ecological chaos caused by brown tree snakes. The skinny reptiles are highly elusive, soundlessly slipping through Guam's forests and suburbs at night, tentatively tasting the air with their tongues to detect the scent of their next meal. But their slight appearance and the surprising rarity of sightings belies their wiles.\nAs it turns out, brown tree snakes are not normal predators. There are few limits on what this ambitious eater will attempt to swallow, and they regularly consume animals that are 70% of their own body weight – equivalent to a 60kg (136lb) human eating a small red kangaroo in a single sitting.\nRecently, a team of scientists led by Rogers were monitoring the survival of fledgling Såli, a kind of forest starling that has managed to eke out an existence in the vicinity of Andersen Air Force Base, a US facility at the north of the island. The researchers attached radio monitors to the young birds and followed up to see what had happened to them. Often, the equipment was discovered inside the digestive systems of brown tree snakes. But there were also more grisly discoveries: dead birds that hadn't been eaten.\nTo their surprise, they found that many fledglings were being killed by the snakes, then abandoned: when their corpses were tracked down, they were coated in a silvery residue of snake saliva, a situation the scientists informally described as \"sliming\". Around half the time, the snakes were killing birds that were too large for them to swallow.\nBut brown tree snakes aren't just greedy – they're also supremely effective hunters, with acrobatic skills that mean they can find prey in even the most inaccessible spaces. To help keep the remaining Såli safe from brown tree snakes, conservationists have been providing nest boxes and fortifying them with metal \"baffles\" – slippery metal poles, 3ft (0.9m) long and around 15cm (6in) across, which no snakes are supposed to be able to climb. Alas, they had been unaware of the crafty predator's special talent.\nIn 2021, a research team led by Savidge – now a professor in the department of fish, wildlife and conservation biology at Colorado State University in the US – discovered \"lasso climbing\", a method entirely new to science.\n\"Brown tree snakes can literally wrap themselves around a cylindrical baffle, hook their tail around their head and then shimmy up like a human climbing up a coconut tree,\" says Pollock, who describes the research as \"mind blowing\". \nIn the last few decades, conservationists and wildlife officials have used every conceivable method in an attempt to eliminate the brown tree snake from Guam – but the reptiles are winning. There have been visual searches, repellents, irritating substances, traps, poisons and deadly chemicals.\nResearchers have even searched for viruses that could be used as bioweapons against brown tree snakes, to eliminate large numbers without affecting other wildlife. This method would operate something like myxomatosis in rabbits, which has been widely circulated on purpose – including in France, illegally, and Australia – with the intention of reducing their numbers. It has also caused widespread suffering, however.\nBut despite intense efforts, and an annual budget for snake control measures that's now around $3.8m (£2.9m), the invaders have proved to be impossible to remove in large numbers. That is, except from a few tiny patches of land. Take the Habitat Management Unit at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. It just so happens that regular over-the-counter acetaminophen (paracetamol) is particularly toxic to brown tree snakes, with even the largest individuals perishing after an 80mg dose – around a sixth of the amount found in one standard 500mg tablet for humans. After a comprehensive programme which involved baiting them with poisoned food – along with erecting a \"snake-proof\" fence around the entire area to prevent it being immediately recolonised – their numbers dropped significantly on the air base.\nAlas, many scientists believe that it would be impossible to remove significant numbers of brown tree snake in a similar way from Guam's forests, let alone altogether. This is despite there being some urgency to do so, because the very forest itself is at risk.\nIt's thought that roughly 70% of Guam's native trees relied on birds to disperse their seeds. But in the disconcertingly silent forest landscape today, many trees drop their fruit directly on the ground – only for it to rot where it fell. Some seeds won’t germinate at all unless the flesh has been eaten, says Rogers, while others struggle to grow in the shadow of their parent tree. With each passing year that the island's avian fruit, nut and seed-eaters don't turn up, the tree species that they used to rely on are dying out.\nThe forest is also starting to develop holes. In a healthy ecosystem, when a tree falls it creates a temporary gap – and this immediately becomes the site of intense competition, as different plants jostle to fill the space. \"It's like if you take down a building in the middle of New York City, it's a prime real estate, there's going to be a lot of people wanting to put a building up there,\" says Rogers. But on Guam this doesn't happen. Without birds to disperse seeds, often there is nothing on the ground that can germinate, so regeneration is extremely slow. The structure of the forest is changing, and soon there may be no easy way back.\nFor now, Guam's brown tree snakes and the army of spiders they have created are safe. And their reign may last for some time yet.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Xand Instagram."]}

But knowing when to seek medical attention can help limit the spread of disease after a storm.\nOver the last seven years, Naresh Kumar and colleagues at the University of Miami have been steadily collecting data on hurricanes, from Maria in 2017 to Irma, Ian, Michael, Dorian and now the recent Hurricanes Helene and Milton, deadly storms which have all inflicted billions of dollars of havoc on the US.\nBut their focus was not on the damage to infrastructure wreaked by the storms, or the lives lost during the storm surge. Instead, they were focused on something far more subtle, and yet still deadly – how such natural disasters can fuel a whole plethora of infectious diseases.\nThis has been spotlighted by the recent aftermath of Hurricane Helene which hit Florida with storm surges and winds of up to 225km/h (140mph) before triggering flooding and landslides in western North Carolina. Florida health authorities released a warning in early October of a likely spike in Vibrio vulnificus infections, urging residents to avoid wading in floodwaters.  \nVibrio vulnificus is a bacteria which can cause the breakdown of skin and soft tissue, sometimes leading to amputations. According to the latest data, 77 cases and 15 deaths have been reported so far in 2024, the most recorded cases in the past decade, though it is not known how many of cases were reported since Helene and Milton. In 2022, Florida reported an unusual increase in Vibrio vulnificus infections in the wake of Hurricane Ian.\n\"Vibrio prefers warmer waters, and hurricanes typically occur during times when the water is warmest,\" says John Drake, director of the centre for the ecology of infectious diseases at the University of Georgia. \"Flooding associated with hurricanes could very well lead to a redistribution of Vibrio further inland, and it goes without saying that there is increased human exposure to contaminated water when a hurricane hits.\"\nEvery year, the impacts of tropical cyclones – defined as storm systems with winds exceeding 119km/h (74mph) – affect an estimated 150 million people around the world, mostly located in coastal communities. These storms encompass hurricanes which occur in the North Atlantic Ocean and Northeast Pacific, typhoons which form in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, and cyclones which begin in the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean.\nWith some forecasts suggesting that the intensity of tropical cyclones will grow with rising ocean temperatures, understanding the full breadth of these storms' impact on disease is becoming increasingly urgent.\n\"We have been studying hurricanes for a while now and there are different pathways through which infectious diseases are exacerbated, mostly contaminated food, contaminated water and an increase in environmental pathogens,\" says Kumar.\nOne of the biggest impacts of hurricanes and other tropical cyclones is thought to be gastrointestinal infections, with communities in the storm's path becoming exposed to the kind of diseases which might traditionally be associated with extreme poverty. Studies have found that hurricanes have caused spates of cholera across the American coastal south, while a 2023 study noted that typhoons in Taiwan had led to an increased burden of intestinal diseases, and infections which later progressed to sepsis.\nAccording to Kumar, the reason for this is because extreme storms cause an enormous displacement of water, with storm surges raising the water level by 6m (19.7ft) or more, overwhelming or destroying sewage infrastructure, as well as introducing animal waste from farms into the water supply. If such pathogens work their way into rivers, they can then travel hundreds of miles.\n\"A certain amount of microbial contamination happens via these routes even through ordinary rainfall,\" says Kumar. \"There's a programme in Florida called Healthy Beaches which shows that the concentrations of bacteria found in human waste jumps whenever there's a significant amount of rain.\"\nMore like this:• The destructive power of Hurricane Milton in 3 images• How zoos protect animals when a hurricane hits• Why mosquitoes are thriving in a warmer world\nThe sheer force of the winds can disperse pathogenic bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms many kilometres into the atmosphere. A specialised aircraft developed by Nasa discovered that a large number of bacteria and fungi had been dispersed to heights of up to 10,000m (33,000ft) by hurricanes Earl and Karl, severe storms which formed in August and September 2010. Together they affected the Atlantic coastlines of North and Central America stretching from Eastern Canada down to Mexico.\nDrake says that such discoveries have already forced some municipalities with large sewage treatment facilities to develop emergency contingency plans to deal with hurricanes. Farms have had to adapt too.\n\"After Hurricane Floyd hit eastern North Carolina in 1999, the resulting flooding and rupture of swine lagoons [where pig manure is stored] led to a public health decree that changed how swine lagoons are built and managed,\" he says. \"I think that the consequences of the atmospheric dispersion of such microorganisms needs much more attention.\"\nOnce the floodwaters recede, the recovery and rebuilding process can begin. However, microbiologists are increasingly realising that an often-overlooked public health threat is the stagnant water left behind pooling in gardens, parts of the home and farmland, creating an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes.\nNumerous studies have shown that the incidence of viral diseases such as West Nile, Zika, dengue and chikungunya, which are spread by mosquitoes, tends to increase in the aftermath of a hurricane. West Nile cases rose in Louisiana and Mississippi following Hurricane Katrina, dengue cases reportedly increased in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Fiona and the risk of contracting Zika rose in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew. While malaria has rarely been considered a public health threat in Canada, there are growing concerns that hurricanes hitting Canada's eastern border may be contributing to the rise of the disease in the south of the country.\n\"Having these standing water sources can change some of the dynamics in the local ecosystem in terms of the number of insects present,\" says Kimberly Davis, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland.\nIndoor flooding can also allow moulds to flourish, with even small leaks capable of inducing fungal growth in ventilation and air conditioning systems, affecting the air quality within homes, compromising breathing and aggravating the immune system. Studies found that flooding in Louisiana following hurricanes Rita and Katrina led to an increase in the airborne fungi Penicillium and Aspergillus, which can cause allergies, respiratory infections and pneumonia.\nKumar tells the BBC that new, currently unpublished data from his research into the aftermath of hurricanes Maria, Irma and Michael, shows that a significant number of people in Florida developed new chronic health conditions such as asthma and allergies in the six months following the disasters, something which he suspects to have been triggered by the spread of moulds. He has also found that existing asthma patients can experience an acute exacerbation or an asthma attack in the immediate aftermath, and their symptoms worsen.\n\"In Florida, the Sun is still quite strong during hurricane season, through September and October, and water evaporates, and become airborne,\" says Kumar. \"Because of this, you have a constant airborne concentration of more fungi in the air.\" Repairing damaged homes often takes precedence over seeking medical attention for their coughing and sneezing, Kumar says.\nKumar says that the long-term consequences of this for public health are often underestimated. \"If you'd never previously been exposed to severe concentrations of black mould inside the home, and now you're chronically exposed to this, you could have allergies or asthma for the rest of your life and it might be life-threatening,\" he says. He remembers one case study after Hurricane Ian \"where someone ended up staying in a mould-infected home and dying two or three months after the hurricane made landfall\".\nIn some cases, the sheer amount of damage to healthcare infrastructure also limits access to medical care, especially for conditions deemed non-life threatening, with power outages and flooding forcing hospitals and pharmacies to close. In New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, three major hospitals were surrounded by floodwater and remained closed for several months.\nBut not everyone in society faces the same level of risk. Gina Charnley, a global health researcher at Imperial College London, says that infectious diseases in the aftermath of natural disasters tend to disproportionately affect those in poverty.\n\"Following disasters, people who have the means and ability to move away from these risks tend to not get sick, and those who can't such as the elderly, pregnant women, or children, are the ones who most often get sick,\" she says. \"Many infectious diseases globally could be reduced if we lift people out of poverty, but we have a long history of inaction on this.\"\nBoth Davis and Kumar believe that more needs to be done when it comes to identifying areas at the greatest risk in the aftermath of severe storms, and preventing, identifying and treating infections.\n\"There is a lot which we could do,\" says Kumar. \"Mobile healthcare delivery systems at every single place where we anticipate people will congregate, including evacuation centres. You have to come to the affected communities where people might be at risk because otherwise they might not seek care and perish because of that. This is not only government responsibility, but of all healthcare providers, public and private.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X and Instagram."]}

In New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, three major hospitals were surrounded by floodwater and remained closed for several months.\nBut not everyone in society faces the same level of risk. Gina Charnley, a global health researcher at Imperial College London, says that infectious diseases in the aftermath of natural disasters tend to disproportionately affect those in poverty.\n\"Following disasters, people who have the means and ability to move away from these risks tend to not get sick, and those who can't such as the elderly, pregnant women, or children, are the ones who most often get sick,\" she says. \"Many infectious diseases globally could be reduced if we lift people out of poverty, but we have a long history of inaction on this.\"\nBoth Davis and Kumar believe that more needs to be done when it comes to identifying areas at the greatest risk in the aftermath of severe storms, and preventing, identifying and treating infections.\n\"There is a lot which we could do,\" says Kumar. \"Mobile healthcare delivery systems at every single place where we anticipate people will congregate, including evacuation centres. You have to come to the affected communities where people might be at risk because otherwise they might not seek care and perish because of that. This is not only government responsibility, but of all healthcare providers, public and private.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X and Instagram."]}

But what is the story behind this unusual moniker and how does it compare to the way other AIs have been named?\nIn Ancient Rome it was a sobriquet for those blessed with red hair. The ruddy complexion of Wiliam II of England – the third son of William the Conqueror – also earned him the same nickname. Today in the UK, the forename \"Rufus\" has acquired a somewhat blue-blooded air. But it is perhaps more common to hear it being hollered by dog-walkers out for a stroll with their furry friends due to its delightful onomatopoeic similarity to barking.\nSo, it may raise some eyebrows to learn that online retail giant Amazon has chosen to give its latest AI assistant the same name. In November 2024, it will be 10 years since Amazon announced its first voice-activated smart assistant Alexa. The name was apparently chosen in homage to the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt.\nBut the origins of the company's latest assistant's moniker are arguably far cuddlier – Rufus is named after Amazon's first \"office dog\".\nRufus now joins a growing list of AI assistants offered by big tech companies with obscure names. Google's Gemini originally had the project title \"Titan\", but was swapped for its current name by the DeepMind team who were developing it. Gemini is Latin for twins, pointing at the collaboration between the DeepMind and Google Research teams on the project, but also to the dual personality attributed to the Gemini zodiac sign.\nThe name for the recently launched Apple Intelligence – which is bringing AI features to the Cupertino-based tech giant's devices – doesn't take a genius to figure out. But its Siri digital assistant was named by Dag Kittlaus, the co-founder of the company that developed the voice-activated software, who named it after a Norwegian colleague before it was acquired by Apple. In Norwegian means \"beautiful woman who leads you to victory\", but the name was also easy to pronounce, according to Kittlaus.\nTales of Rufus ­– a charming Welsh corgi – date back to Amazon's earliest days.\nIt was 1996, in the midst of the dot com boom, not long after Susan and Eric Benson came to work at the two-year-old startup together. At the time, there were less than 20 employees at Amazon and Eric was the fifth engineer they hired. Susan was a journalist who would become the editorial voice of the pioneering online store. Working long hours as the company geared up to go public, the couple began bringing their two-year-old dog with them to the office.\nIt didn't take long for the canine to integrate into the working day: chasing down tennis balls in hallways, begging for treats from other workers, sleeping his way through meetings under tables, and using his paw (with a little human help) to launch features on the website. These include the algorithm that recommends books based on what others have read.\nRufus would go on to become the first face of Amazon's error page to alert users when things went wrong.   Long after the Bensons retired in 2001, Rufus continued to make appearances on campus with his dog sitter who still worked there. The dog lived to the ripe old age of 15 and helped to start the dog-friendly culture at Amazon that allows employees to bring their pets to work.\nToday, Amazon has more than 10,000 dogs registered as \"working\" at the tech giant. Popular amenities on campuses around the world include decked out dog parks, unlimited treats, and meetups for furry friends.\nAmazon is far from the only tech company to have embraced a dog friendly workplace. Google welcomes dogs at its offices and its canine-owning employees are known as Dooglers. The company's Mountain View campus even has a dog park called the Doogleplex.\nAmazon also has an office building in downtown Seattle named after its first dog. The Rufus Building is where is where the company's AI-powered shopping assistant was developed and the root of its name, according to Rajiv Mehta, Amazon's vice president of search and conversational shopping.\n\"We did extensive research on the name Rufus from many marketplaces that Amazon operates in and overall, we found that it was a brand and a name that resonated with customers around the world,\" says Mehta.\nAlthough Rufus passed away in 2009, his legacy lives on. Amazon has now launched its AI assistant in the US, India and the UK, to provide information to customers as they make purchasing decisions. It is intended to answer questions about products.\nAlthough customers can talk to Rufus, the AI assistant does not yet have a voice and can only respond by text and images. Mehta declined to speculate whether it would be integrated with Alexa. \"I can't speak to plans on Alexa,\" he says. \"The teams are completely separate at this point.\"\nTo date, Rufus has answered more than 100 million queries, says Mehta.\nWe asked Rufus for some more information about dogs. Its response was as heart-warming as the original Rufus:\n\"Dogs are one of the most beloved pets in the world. They are loyal, friendly and make great companions. Despite their differences, all dogs share a few key traits – they are affectionate, protective of their owners, and eager to please. Dogs require proper care, including regular exercise, grooming, and veterinary checkups. In return, they provide unconditional love and can even improve their owner's physical and mental health. Whether as a family pet or a working animal, dogs have been an integral part of human society for thousands of years.\"\nWhile we can't know how pleased the original Rufus would have been with this summary, he may well have mourned the omission of treats.\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X."]}

But soon the party was interrupted by an uninvited guest.\nIt was late evening, and outside there was a hog roasting – the remains of dinner. The fire was going down, though still warm. Everyone briefly walked off to chat. When they came back, there was a brown form curled around the pig – something shiny and scaly, with vertical slit-eyes and a wide, smiling mouth. The creature was ripping off chunks of the pig's flesh and swallowing them whole – slowly gulping them into its pale, distended body.\n\"It wasn't [exactly] a 400-pound (181kg) pig, but it was a pig for a big party,\" says Rogers, an associate professor in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation at Virginia Tech in the US, who has been studying Guam's ecology for the last 22 years.\nThe visitor without table manners was a brown tree snake – an alien invader which is thought to have been inadvertently introduced to Guam in the 1940s, perhaps after sneaking onto a cargo ship. Before this, an abundance of native birds had enjoyed an idyllic existence in the island's otherworldly limestone forests. But within just four decades of the snake's debut, these voracious predators had begun emptying the jungle of every single one. Out of 12 species, 10 are now extinct on the island, while the remaining two are clinging on in inaccessible caves and urban areas.\nNow that the avian community has been virtually wiped out, Guam's population of some two million snakes – no one really knows how many there are – will hoover up whatever they can find, including rats, shrews, lizards, or, on this occasion, human leftovers.\n\"I mean, they'll eat anything,\" says Henry Pollock, executive director of the Southern Plains Land Trust, a non-profit in Colorado, who has previously studied the ecology of Guam. \"They'll eat each other.\"\nWith a plague of ravenous snakes, and forests that are entirely devoid of the friendly whistles, chirps and caws that once dominated their soundscape, Guam has become notorious as one of the planet's most spectacular ecological debacles. But the consequences of the island's snake infestation extend far beyond its eerily silent, bird-less forests. Here, an evolutionary experiment is unfolding. And one notable beneficiary has eight legs, plenty of eyes – and the good luck to find itself on an island where sharp, hungry beaks are little more than a distant memory.\nRogers is not frightened of spiders – and that's just as well.\nOn most of the Mariana Islands, there are relatively few spiders in the rainy season, with a large spike as the climate dries out. But not on Guam. The island's limestone forests are an arachno-nightmare all year round – a near-continuous tangle of silvery threads that stretches for miles, where every step you take reveals another web and its hairy host.\nThere are giant, yellow-bellied banana spiders, with their golden webs in the classic spoked style; scuttling huntsman spiders the size of a human hand; tent-web spiders, which drape their vast pavilions of silk across gaps in the trees. Rogers calls the latter kind the \"condo\" web, because each one is akin to an apartment complex for creatures with eight legs – they contain hundreds of gleaming eyes, belonging to tens of individual spiders.\n\"You'll have many females at different levels in this massive web, and then many males hanging around and the edges,\" says Rogers. These communal webs are also a favourite of tiny Argyrodes spiders, who turn up to steal prey from, and occasionally eat, their much larger hosts. \"On Guam these [condo webs] go from ground level, all the way up to the canopy – they can be everywhere,\" she says.\nMost of the time, the whole forest looks like it's been draped in wisps of artificial spider's web for Halloween. \"It's enough that when you're hiking, it's common for the person in front to pick up a spider stick and knock down the webs as they go,\" says Rogers, \"otherwise you'll be covered in spider webs… I love it, but it is difficult to get through.\"\nWherever there is a gap in the trees, the entire space will be filled with webs from hundreds of different spiders, all catching the light at different angles. These collective efforts can easily occupy a space the size of a room. \"I had a friend once who ran into the middle of one and just twirled in a circle, making a mummy out of himself with this massive bit of web,\" says Rogers,\" he did that to freak out the people he was with\".\nOn another occasion, an assistant of Rogers volunteered to help in the field – only to get a couple of metres into the forest and change her mind. \"She was like, 'No, I'm out',\" says Rogers.\nEven without the spiders, which in the native Chamorro language are known as sånye'ye', Guam's limestone forests would be a strange and hostile place, like nowhere else.\nOverhead, towering breadfruit trees mingle with the Jurassic shapes of cycads, along with tangantangan (castor-oil) and spiky pandanus trees, forming a low canopy of jungle which is frequently ripped up by typhoons. On the ground, there is very little soil. Instead, plants grow directly out of limestone karst, forcing their roots into tiny fissures in the rock – the forest sits atop an ancient coral reef which has been pushed up over millions of years to form a plateau. Coral heads still litter the forest floor, and where the rock has eroded away, there are sinkholes and caves.\n\"I think the unique thing is, just like, it's really difficult to walk because – well, imagine walking on sharp rocks,\" says Rogers. When she takes new field technicians out for surveys, they need time to acclimatise to this rocky ground – she talks about people getting their \"karst legs\". \"It's like getting your sea legs – being able to walk without having to focus on every step,\" she says.\nSo, when Rogers decided to take a survey of the number of spiders in 2012, she knew it would be a challenge.\nThere had always been rumours that Guam was particularly spidery – and that this might have something to do with the absence of birds, which ordinarily love to eat them. However, Rogers explains that the island's population of roughly 180,000 people rarely travel to the other Northern Mariana Islands – while they are all part of a self-governing commonwealth, only Guam is a US territory. As a result, there is little opportunity for comparison. And scientists had never actually checked.\nTo find out exactly how many arachnids had taken over Guam, Rogers and colleagues set about completing transect surveys in the island's forests. For these, researchers carefully picked their way over the jagged coral reef underfoot while unspooling a roll of tape in a straight line. As they went. they carefully counted the spider's webs in their path which still contained a fanged occupant, if they fell within a metre of the line.\nWhat the scientists found was a population of arachno-spectacular proportions: during the wet season, there were 40 times more spiders in Guam's forests than there were on the nearby islands of Rota, Tinian and Saipan – while in the dry season, when spider populations in the region usually escalate, there were 2.3 times more spiders on Guam. The webs of banana spiders on Guam were also around 50% bigger.\nAll year round, Guam's forests were positively glistening with webs: the team found 1.8 and 2.6 webs per metre of transect line in the wet seasons and dry seasons respectively. If extrapolated to Guam's entire forest area this would amount to between 508 and 733 million spiders in total, scampering around on their webs and sucking the juices out of their victims. That's assuming one spider per web, though there are often far more – and only counting those living within two metres of the ground. In terms of spidery body parts, the forest ends up hosting at least 4,064,000,000 eyes and an equal number of hairy, articulated legs. \nRota, Tinian and Saipan are free of brown tree snakes and still have healthy bird populations, so the study suggests that Guam's spider population might once have been unremarkable – before exploding over the last few decades, in the absence of birds. This is partly because of the avian predilection for creatures with eight legs, and also because they compete for the spiders' insect prey – and it fits with research conducted in the Bahamas, which has found that spiders are about 10 times more abundant on islands without lizards.\nSince the brown tree snake's arrival, the banana spider's existence on Guam has become so comfortable, they have even stopped adding \"stabilimenta\" to their webs. It's not known why spiders add these mysterious decorations, which usually involve zig-zag patterns made from opaque white threads. One idea is that they warn birds of the web's presence, preventing them from accidentally flying into them – and this is backed up by the feature's unusually low frequency on bird-less Guam.  \nThough brown tree snakes are thought to have been shifting the balance of Guam's ecosystems since they were introduced shortly after World War Two, this went largely undetected for at least four decades. By the late 1980s, ecologists had noticed that something was wiping out the island's birds – but no one had any idea what.\nJulie Savidge, who was a PhD student at the time, decided to track down this mystery killer, which was suspected to be either a pesticide or a virus. Her research – published in 1987 – revealed that it was, in fact, down to the snakes. As island species, most of Guam's birds had no evolutionary programming that could help them to avoid the reptiles' insatiable appetite for poultry – there are no native snakes, so their ancestors were equally clueless. Consequently, when the predators arrived they found an all-you-can-eat buffet of defenceless birds which quickly became dinner.\nBy the time Savidge had worked out what was going on, for most avian species it was already too late. The Guam flycatcher was last seen in the wild in 1984, and this wide-eyed little ball of feathers is now considered extinct. Others have had a narrow escape.\nThe lurid ginger and iridescent green Guam kingfisher was considered extinct in the wild until earlier this year, when nine captive individuals were introduced to the Palmyra Atoll, some 5,879 km (3,653 miles) away from their natural home. The Guam rail, a flightless bird known locally as the Ko'ko', was also once listed as extinct in the wild. Today their reddish-brown bodies and houndstooth bellies can be seen scurrying around Rota and the Cocos islands, where they have been introduced.\nBut only in recent years have researchers begun to uncover the true scale of ecological chaos caused by brown tree snakes. The skinny reptiles are highly elusive, soundlessly slipping through Guam's forests and suburbs at night, tentatively tasting the air with their tongues to detect the scent of their next meal. But their slight appearance and the surprising rarity of sightings belies their wiles.\nAs it turns out, brown tree snakes are not normal predators. There are few limits on what this ambitious eater will attempt to swallow, and they regularly consume animals that are 70% of their own body weight – equivalent to a 60kg (136lb) human eating a small red kangaroo in a single sitting.\nRecently, a team of scientists led by Rogers were monitoring the survival of fledgling Såli, a kind of forest starling that has managed to eke out an existence in the vicinity of Andersen Air Force Base, a US facility at the north of the island. The researchers attached radio monitors to the young birds and followed up to see what had happened to them. Often, the equipment was discovered inside the digestive systems of brown tree snakes. But there were also more grisly discoveries: dead birds that hadn't been eaten.\nTo their surprise, they found that many fledglings were being killed by the snakes, then abandoned: when their corpses were tracked down, they were coated in a silvery residue of snake saliva, a situation the scientists informally described as \"sliming\". Around half the time, the snakes were killing birds that were too large for them to swallow.\nBut brown tree snakes aren't just greedy – they're also supremely effective hunters, with acrobatic skills that mean they can find prey in even the most inaccessible spaces. To help keep the remaining Såli safe from brown tree snakes, conservationists have been providing nest boxes and fortifying them with metal \"baffles\" – slippery metal poles, 3ft (0.9m) long and around 15cm (6in) across, which no snakes are supposed to be able to climb. Alas, they had been unaware of the crafty predator's special talent.\nIn 2021, a research team led by Savidge – now a professor in the department of fish, wildlife and conservation biology at Colorado State University in the US – discovered \"lasso climbing\", a method entirely new to science.\n\"Brown tree snakes can literally wrap themselves around a cylindrical baffle, hook their tail around their head and then shimmy up like a human climbing up a coconut tree,\" says Pollock, who describes the research as \"mind blowing\". \nIn the last few decades, conservationists and wildlife officials have used every conceivable method in an attempt to eliminate the brown tree snake from Guam – but the reptiles are winning. There have been visual searches, repellents, irritating substances, traps, poisons and deadly chemicals.\nResearchers have even searched for viruses that could be used as bioweapons against brown tree snakes, to eliminate large numbers without affecting other wildlife. This method would operate something like myxomatosis in rabbits, which has been widely circulated on purpose – including in France, illegally, and Australia – with the intention of reducing their numbers. It has also caused widespread suffering, however.\nBut despite intense efforts, and an annual budget for snake control measures that's now around $3.8m (£2.9m), the invaders have proved to be impossible to remove in large numbers. That is, except from a few tiny patches of land. Take the Habitat Management Unit at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. It just so happens that regular over-the-counter acetaminophen (paracetamol) is particularly toxic to brown tree snakes, with even the largest individuals perishing after an 80mg dose – around a sixth of the amount found in one standard 500mg tablet for humans. After a comprehensive programme which involved baiting them with poisoned food – along with erecting a \"snake-proof\" fence around the entire area to prevent it being immediately recolonised – their numbers dropped significantly on the air base.\nAlas, many scientists believe that it would be impossible to remove significant numbers of brown tree snake in a similar way from Guam's forests, let alone altogether. This is despite there being some urgency to do so, because the very forest itself is at risk.\nIt's thought that roughly 70% of Guam's native trees relied on birds to disperse their seeds. But in the disconcertingly silent forest landscape today, many trees drop their fruit directly on the ground – only for it to rot where it fell. Some seeds won’t germinate at all unless the flesh has been eaten, says Rogers, while others struggle to grow in the shadow of their parent tree. With each passing year that the island's avian fruit, nut and seed-eaters don't turn up, the tree species that they used to rely on are dying out.\nThe forest is also starting to develop holes. In a healthy ecosystem, when a tree falls it creates a temporary gap – and this immediately becomes the site of intense competition, as different plants jostle to fill the space. \"It's like if you take down a building in the middle of New York City, it's a prime real estate, there's going to be a lot of people wanting to put a building up there,\" says Rogers. But on Guam this doesn't happen. Without birds to disperse seeds, often there is nothing on the ground that can germinate, so regeneration is extremely slow. The structure of the forest is changing, and soon there may be no easy way back.\nFor now, Guam's brown tree snakes and the army of spiders they have created are safe. And their reign may last for some time yet.\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Xand Instagram."]}

Halfway through, it crashed. They sat down with the BBC 55 years later.\nAt the height of the Cold War, Charley Kline and Bill Duvall were two bright-eyed engineers on the front lines of one of technology's most ambitious experiments. Kline, a 21-year-old graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and Duvall, a 29-year-old systems programmer at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), were working on a system called Arpanet, short for the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. Funded by the US Department of Defense, the project aimed to create a network that could directly share data without relying on telephone lines. Instead, this system used a method of data delivery called \"packet switching\" that would later form the basis for the modern internet.\nIt was the first test of a technology that would change almost every facet of human life. But before it could work, you had to log in.\nKline sat at his keyboard between the lime-green walls of UCLA's Boelter Hall Room 3420, prepared to connect with Duvall, who was working a computer halfway across the state of California. But Kline didn't even make it all the way through the word \"L-O-G-I-N\" before Duvall told him over the phone that his system crashed. Thanks to that error, the first \"message\" that Kline sent Duvall on that autumn day in 1969 was simply the letters \"L-O\".\nThey got their connection up and running about an hour later after some tweaks, and that initial crash was just a blip in an otherwise monumental achievement. But neither man realised the significance of the moment. \"I certainly didn't at that time,\" Kline says. \"We were just trying to get it to work.\"\nThe BBC spoke to Kline and Duvall for the 55th anniversary of the occasion. Half a century later, the internet has shrunk the whole world down to a small black box that fits in your pocket, one that dominates our attention and touches the furthest reaches of lived experience. But it all started with two men, experiencing just how frustrating it is when you can't get online for the very first time.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nCan you describe the computers that enabled Arpanet? Were these massive, noisy machines?\nKline: They were small computers – by standards of that time – about the size of a refrigerator. They were somewhat noisy from the cooling fans, but quiet compared with the sounds from all the fans in our Sigma 7 computer. There were lights on the front that would blink, switches that could control the IMP [Interface Message Processor], and a paper tape reader that could be used to load the software.\nDuvall: They were in a rack big enough to hold a complete set of sound equipment for a large show today. And they were thousands if not millions or billions of times less powerful than the processor in an Apple Watch. These were the old days!\nTake us inside that moment when you started typing L-O.\nKline: Unlike websites and other systems today, when you connected a terminal to the SRI system nothing happened until you typed something. If you wanted to run a programme, you first needed to login – by typing the word \"login\" – and the system would ask for your user name and password.\nAs I typed a character on my terminal – a teletype model 33 – it would get sent from my terminal to the programme I wrote for the SDS Sigma 7 computer. That programme would take the character, format it into a message and send it to the Interface Message Processor. When it was received by SRI's system, [it] would treat [the message] as if it came from a local terminal and would process it. It would \"echo\" the character [replicate it on the terminal]. In this case, Bill's code would take that character and format it into a message and send it to the IMP to go back to UCLA. When I received it, I would print it on my terminal.\nI was on the phone with Bill when we tried this. I told him I typed the letter L. He told me he had received the letter L and echoed it back. I told him that it printed. Then I typed the letter O. Again, it worked fine. I typed the letter G. Bill told me his system had crashed, and he would call me back.\nDuvall: The UCLA system did not anticipate that it would receive G-I-N after Charlie had typed L-O, so it sent an error message to the SRI computer. I don't recall exactly what the message was, but what happened next was due to the fact that the network connection was much faster than anything seen before.\nThe normal connection speed was 10 characters per second whereas the Arpanet could transmit characters at up to 5,000 characters per second. The result of this message being sent from UCLA to the SRI computer flooded the input buffer which only expected 10 characters per second. It was like filling a glass with a fire hose. I quickly discovered what had happened, changed the buffer size and rebuilt the system, which took about an hour.\nDid you realise this could be a historic moment?\nKline: No, I certainly didn't at that time.\nDuvall: Not really. It was another step forward in the larger context of the work we were doing at SRI which we did believe would have a large impact.\nWhen Samuel Morse sent the first telegraph message in 1844, he had an eye for drama, tapping out \"What hath God wrought\" on a line from Washington, DC to Baltimore, Maryland, US. If you could go back, would you have typed something more memorable?\nKline: Of course, if I had realised its importance. But we were just trying to get it to work.\nDuvall: No. This was the first test of a very complicated system with a lot of moving parts. To have something this complex work in the very first test was dramatic in and of itself.\nWhat was the atmosphere like when the message was sent?\nDuvall: We were each alone in our respective computer laboratories at night. We were both happy to have had such a successful first test as the culmination of a lot of work. I went to a local \"watering hole\" and had a burger and a beer.\nKline: I was happy that it worked and went home to get some sleep.\nWhat did you expect Arpanet to become?\nDuvall: I saw the work we were doing at SRI as a critical part of a larger vision, that of information workers connected to each other and sharing problems, observations, documents and solutions. What we did not see was the commercial adoption nor did we anticipate the phenomenon of social media and the associated disinformation plague. Although, it should be noted, that in [SRI computer scientist] Douglas Engelbart's 1962 treatise describing the overall vision, he notes that the capabilities we were creating would trigger profound change in our society, and it would be necessary to simultaneously use and adapt the tools we were creating to address the problems which would arise from their use in society.\nWhat aspects of the internet today remind you of Arpanet?\nDuvall: Referring to the larger vision which was being created in Engelbart's group (the mouse, full screen editing, links, etc.), the internet today is a logical evolution of those ideas enhanced, of course, by the contributions of many bright and innovative people and organisations.\nKline: The ability to use resources from others. That's what we do when we use a website. We are using the facilities of the website and its programmes, features, etc. And, of course, email.\nThe Arpanet pretty much created the concept of routing and multiple paths from one site to another. That got reliability in case a communication line failed. It also allowed increases in communication speeds by using multiple paths simultaneously. Those concepts have carried over to the internet.\nAs we developed the communications protocols for the Arpanet, we discovered problems, redesigned and improved the protocols and learned many lessons that carried over to the Internet. TCP/IP [the basic standard for internet connection] was developed both to interconnect networks, in particular the Arpanet with other networks, and also to improve performance, reliability and more.\nHow do you feel about this anniversary?\nKline: That's a mix. Personally, I feel it is important, but a little overblown. The Arpanet and what sprang from it are very important. This particular anniversary to me is just one of many events. I find somewhat more important than this particular anniversary were the decisions by Arpa to build the Network and continue to support its development.\nDuvall: It's nice to remember the origin of something like the internet, but the most important thing is the enormous amount of work that has been done since that time to turn it into what is a major part of societies worldwide.\nThe modern web is dominated not by government or academic researchers, but by some of the largest companies in the world. How do you feel about what the internet has become? What are you most concerned about?\nKline: We use it in our daily lives, and it is very important. It's hard to imagine ever not having it again. One of the benefits of it being so open and not controlled by a government is that new ideas can get developed, such as online shopping, banking, video streaming, news sites, social media, and more. But because it has become so important to our lives it is a target for malicious activity.\nWe hear constantly about how things have been compromised. There is a tremendous loss of privacy. And the big companies (Google, Meta, Amazon and internet service providers such as Comcast and AT&T) have too much power in my opinion. But I am not sure of the right remedy.\nDuvall: I think that there is great danger in the domination by any single entity. We have seen the power of disinformation in directing policy and elections. We have also seen the power of companies in influencing the direction of social norms and the formation of adults and young adults.\nKline: One of my biggest fears has been about the spread of false information. How many times have you heard someone say, \"I saw it on the internet\". It was always possible to spread false information, but it would cost money to send out mailers, put up a billboard or take out a TV ad. Now it is cheap and easy. And as it reaches millions of people, it gets repeated and treated as fact.\nAnother fear is that as more and more critical systems have moved onto the internet it becomes easier to cause a serious disruption if those systems are taken down or compromised. For example, not only communications systems but banking, utilities, transportation, etc.\nDuvall: It has great power but, not heeding Engelbart's warning in 1962, we have not effectively used the power of the internet to manage the social impact.\nAre there any lessons from your time at Arpanet that could make it a better place for everyone?\nKline: While the openness of the internet allows experimentation and new uses, the lack of control can lead to compromises. Arpa kept some control of the Arpanet. That way they could make sure that everything worked, make decisions about which protocols were required, deal with issues such as site names and other issues.\nMore Like This● Google just updated its algorithm. The Internet will never be the same● 'Postcards are the email of their day': How cat memes went viral 100 years ago● We're losing our digital history. Can the Internet Archive save it?\nWhile Icann [the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers] still manages some of that, there have been international disagreements about how to move forward and whether the US has too much control, etc. But we still need some controls to keep the network functional. Also, since the Arpanet was relatively small, we could experiment with major changes in design, protocols, and more. That would be extremely hard now.\nDuvall: We are standing on the edge of a precipice with AI and the reflexive access it has to everyone who graces the internet. The internet had explosive growth and development – some of it socially damaging – in the early days. AI now stands at that threshold, and is inseparable from the internet. And it is not unreasonable to call AI an existential threat. The time to recognise the dangers as well as the promise is now.\n--\nFor timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, Xand Instagram."]}

But patients can also develop severe lung problems after many hours of deep sedation, a complication which accounts for a quarter of all deaths within the first six days of surgery.\nSuch tragedies sometimes occur due to underlying frailties in the patient's physiology which had gone undetected. But what if hospitals had a quick, low-cost way of screening for them ahead of major procedures? \nSchoettker and his colleagues are conducting a trial which involves fitting patients with a smartwatch known as the Masimo W1 several weeks ahead of their pre-operation consultation. The data it has collected is then used to form an assessment of their state of health.\nThe W1 provides continuous readings of heart rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen, pulse rate and even hydration levels, all to medical-grade accuracy. Schoettker describes the layers of information as being akin to a \"digital twin\", and believes it could help save lives.\n\"We plan to use this pre-operatively acquired data to predict possible pre or postoperative complications and act on them in a preventative way,\" says Schoettker. \nThis is just one example of how the booming smartwatch market – some analysts have predicted that more than 400 million devices will be sold worldwide by 2027 – is opening up a bold new era of preventative health. Masimo, Apple, Samsung, Withings, FitBit and Polar have all developed watches capable of recording an extraordinary amount of data, allowing measurements such as sleep quality, blood pressure, heart rhythm variation and blood oxygen saturation levels – a marker of how well the heart and lungs are functioning – to be tracked in real-time.\nGosia Wamil, a consultant cardiologist at Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London, says that this information is already helping to alert doctors to potential health problems, enabling them to act sooner.\n\"More and more patients are willing to use their smartwatches to acquire some data, and then bring the printouts and results to us,\" says Wamil. \"And then we can investigate further and confirm those abnormalities.\"\nSo far, some of the biggest applications have been related to heart health. In April this year, one study found that smartwatch-acquired electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements – readings of the heart's electrical activity – could reliably identify extra heart beats in otherwise healthy 50 to 70 year olds. This can be a warning sign of a much more serious condition, atrial fibrillation, where the heart starts beating irregularly or accelerating out of control without warning. \nOther research has found that AI algorithms can use Apple Watch ECG readings to identify people with a low ejection fraction – the amount of blood that your heart pumps each time it beats, which can be a key warning sign of heart failure – with 88% accuracy. Wamil says that this combination of machine learning platforms and smartwatch-derived data is likely to prove revolutionary for patients with all kinds of heart conditions.\n\"In cardiology clinics, we see patients who complain of palpitations, and we used to have those tapes which we could stick on their chest and record their ECG over 24 hours,\" says Wamil. \"Very frequently, patients may not have symptoms during those 24 hours. But with smartwatches, whenever the patient experiences symptoms, they can press a button on their watch, acquire an ECG and show that to us.\"\nWamil says this is already leading to preventative treatment, enabling cardiologists to prescribe blood thinner tablets to patients with signs of an irregular heartbeat, to help prevent strokes. She is also interested in whether this data can be used to prevent some of the cardiovascular complications experienced by many type 2 diabetes patients.\n\"The reason why people with diabetes have shorter lives is because they are much more at risk of developing heart problems,\" says Wamil. \"We hope that in the future, this data could be used to detect early signs to alert the patient and doctor about their future risk of heart attacks and strokes.\"\nBut many of the applications of smartwatches could extend far beyond the heart. In July 2023, researchers at Cardiff University published a study using data from more than 100,000 people, who were given a smartwatch to wear for a week. The results showed that it was possible to identify individuals with signs of Parkinson's disease up to seven years before their clinical diagnosis. This was done by detecting subtle abnormalities in their walking patterns, as measured by the watch's motion sensors. \nCynthia Sandor, who led the study, believes it could be possible to pinpoint these signs even sooner through combining motion data with other smartwatch measurements such as sleep quality, which is known to be disturbed in people who develop the disease. \n\"In Parkinson's, diagnosis is preceded by a long phase where signs such as subtle motor changes become apparent,\" says Sandor. \"We found that the most predictive feature was a slowing of movement during light physical activity, too subtle to be noticed by individuals themselves.\"\nSandor believes this information could soon be used to recruit individuals to clinical trials. One of the theories for why effective treatments for Parkinson's have proven so elusive is because patients are diagnosed at a stage where significant brain damage has already occurred, and it may be easier to slow or even reverse the disease at an earlier stage. \"We hope that early screening tools based on smartwatch data can identify people early, potentially enabling neuroprotective treatment trials to be successful,\" she says.  \nIt is also hoped that smartwatches could one day soon help people living with chronic conditions such as epilepsy, through providing them with early warning signs that a seizure is about to occur. Falls and serious accidents resulting from seizures are known risk factors for those living with epilepsy. \n\"The uncertainty of when seizures might occur is one of the most difficult aspects of living with epilepsy,\" says Aileen McGonigal of the Queensland Brain Institute. \"Seizure forecasting is however still at an early stage.\"\nMcGonigal is interested in whether a special prototype version of the Empatica smartwatch designed for research can aid with seizure prediction. In an ongoing research project, she is applying AI algorithms to a combination of data streams. These include heart rate variability, skin temperature, body movement patterns and changes in the electrical conductance of the skin due to sweating, which reflects alterations in the body's autonomic nervous system. Each of these parameters can be measured by the watch.\n\"We aim to analyse patterns in the hours leading up to seizures,\" says McGonigal. \"Ideally epilepsy researchers and clinicians would like for patients to be able to forecast when seizures are more likely to occur, which might allow tailoring of treatment, including variable doses of medication and adaption of daily activities to reduce risk of seizure-related falls and injury,\" she says.\nBut while there is considerable excitement about what the combination of powerful AI algorithms and increasingly accurate wearable measurements might be able to achieve, some doctors are also cautious about the potential for false positives. There are concerns that the overuse of smartwatches could lead to an increase in patient anxiety, as well as testing the resources of already overstretched health systems.\n\"Technology is helping medicine in many different ways,\" says Jeremy Smelt, a consultant thoracic surgeon at St George's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. \"One of them is the early detection of problems, but it can also save lives. As with all technologies, smartwatches have to be tried and tested. False positives will cause anxiety and may end up in people going to the GP when they don't need to. But they are also very interesting for those with health conditions and could save health services money through picking things up early,\" he says.\nBut as smartwatches become even more sophisticated, and manufacturers figure out more and more ways to obtain quantifiable data about the human body, the list of potential preventative health applications is only going to increase.\nMasimo CEO Joe Kiani is already focusing on the next frontier for his company's smartwatches: being able to predict an asthma attack.\n\"We have a measurement for respiratory effort,\" says Kiani. \"We can tell when you're struggling to breathe because respiration rate increases, pulse rate increases… all trying to make up for the lack of oxygen that you're getting,\" he says. \"What's crazy is that for the past 50 to 60 years, all we've had at home is a thermometer to help you decide what to do [when you're sick].

{"id": 29, "question": "What is the name of the private language created by Matthew and Michael Youlden?", "answer": ["Umeri"], "doc": ["It turns out we weren’t the first people who have sought entry into the secret world of this two-person language. Matthew and Michael have had to rebuff would-be infiltrators before – like the linguist who desperately wanted to write his master’s thesis about their language.", "Michael and Matthew are the only two people who speak, read and write it, having created it themselves as children. The brothers insist Umeri isn't an intentionally secret language. \"Umeri isn't ever reduced to a language used to keep things private,\" they say in an email.", "\"Whether it's 'iPad' or 'lightning cable' – all of these are words that didn't exist 20 or 30 years ago,\" says Matthew. They now run their own language coaching company supporting individuals, educational institutions and private companies with language learning. Michael lives in Grand Canaria and Matthew in the Basque Country.", "Ciphers, codes and slang are one thing, but a constructed language spoken by only two people on Earth piqued my curiosity and set my imagination into overdrive. What was this home-brewed, secret language? Maybe the Super Polyglot Brothers didn’t want to talk about it, but I sure did!", "In the above video, Matthew and Michael Youlden warily admitted to me that they speak a “twin language” together, a secret language that only they know how to speak. “But we’re not going to talk about that, are we?” they concurred before quickly changing the subject.", "Up to 50% of twins develop their own communication pattern with one another. Most lose it over time, but for the Youlden twins it has become a normal way of communicating.\nTwins Matthew and Michael Youlden speak 25 languages each. The 26th is Umeri, which they don't include in their tally. \nIf you've not heard of Umeri, there's good reason for that. Michael and Matthew are the only two people who speak, read and write it, having created it themselves as children.\nThe brothers insist Umeri isn't an intentionally secret language.\n\"Umeri isn't ever reduced to a language used to keep things private,\" they say in an email. \"It definitely has a very sentimental value to us, as it reflects the deep bond we share as identical twins.\"\nAn estimated 30-50% of twins develop a shared language or particular communication pattern that is only comprehensible to them, known as cryptophasia. The term translates directly from Greek as secret speech.\nNancy Segal, director of the Twin Studies Center at California State University, believes there are now better and more nuanced words for the phenomenon, and prefers to use \"private speech\". In her book Twin Mythconceptions, Segal also uses the phrase \"shared verbal understanding\" to refer to speech used within the pair.\n\"Based on available studies, it is safe to say that about 40% of twin toddlers engage in some form of 'twin-speak',\" writes Segal. \"But that figure does not convey just how complex twins' language development turns out to be.\"\nRoy Johannink from the Netherlands is father to teenage twins Merle and Stijn. Thirteen years ago, when they were babies, he took a video of them babbling to one another and shared it on YouTube. To date, their conversation has had over 30 million views. Johannink happened to have his camera on hand at the moment the two first began to verbally interact with each other.\n\"I was a little surprised that they saw each other,\" remembers Johannink. \"They thought: 'Hey, I'm not alone in this moment. There's another one of me! It's us against the world.'\"\nSegal explains that like Merle and Stijn (who went on to lose their shared language when they learnt Dutch), most twins outgrow their private words as they gain more exposure to other people beyond the home.\nBut for the Youlden twins, this wasn't the case. They didn't outgrow their language. Quite the contrary, they enriched and perfected it over the years.\nBorn and raised in Manchester in the UK, the Youlden twins grew up surrounded by different ethnicities and cultures, fostering a love of languages.\nMemories of when Umeri first began are hazy, but the brothers remember their grandfather being confused when as pre-schoolers, the two would share a joke between themselves he would not understand.\nThen came their first family holiday abroad, at the age of eight. They were headed to Spain and decided they were going to learn Spanish, convinced that if they didn't, they'd struggle to order ice cream. Armed with a dictionary and with little understanding of how the grammar worked, they began to translate phrases word for word from English into Spanish. Later they took on Italian, and then turned their attention to learning Scandinavian languages. Pooling together various grammatical elements of all the languages they had studied, the brothers realised Umeri could actually become a fully-fledged language itself.\nThis chimes with Segal's observations. According to her, in general, \"twins do not invent a new language, they tend to produce atypical forms of the language they are exposed to. Even though it's unintelligible, they still direct it to other people\".\nThe Youlden twins began to standardise and codify Umeri. At one point, they even tried to design their own alphabet but realised (when they got their first computer) it would be of little use considering there was no Umeri font. Umeri is now written using the Latin alphabet.\nPreserving a language spoken by few people comes with its own challenges, however.\n\"Twins have this shared language, that at some point they stop using, as if they feel ashamed of it,\" says Matthew. \"This is also not something unique to twin languages.\"\nAnyone speaking a minority language – meaning a language not shared by much of the rest of society – may grow shy of speaking it, \"especially if you are raised with a minority language where you are maybe ostracised or looked at funnily at school,\" he says. \"We thankfully never had that [reaction from others].\" On the contrary, in the Youlden home, their parents never saw the development of Umeri between the brothers as a negative thing.\nWhen the brothers would swerve off to converse in their own language when with extended family, the response tended to be \"they're off doing the language thing again\", recalls Matthew.\nKaren Thorpe is a specialist in child development, education and care research at the Queensland Brain Institute at the University of Queensland. She has in previous roles extensively studied language development in twins.\n\"For me, it's about a very close relationship,\" she says. \"Rather than seeing it as something strange and unusual, private language is really about a beautiful thing that humans do when they're very, very close to one another. But is that exclusive to twins? I don't think so. I think it's exclusive to very special, close relationships.\"\nShe also regards it as a normal development feature. As she put it in a 2010 research paper: \"It is simply that young children who are just beginning to speak tend to understand each other rather better than do their parents or other adults.\"\nFor others, such as the Youldens, the languages are a combination of closeness and intellectual curiosity, though Thorpe says this long-term, conscious development of a private language is relatively rare.\nThere are limited case studies available on cryptophasia – or \"twin language\" – and some of the most well-known are rooted in psychiatry.\nJune and Jennifer Gibbons are one such example.

It ended with a bitter argument, tears, frustration, and we haven't spoken since. For a long time I grieved the loss of that friendship, of her being in my life. Even now, over five years later, I occasionally find myself dreaming about her and often wonder if we will ever re-connect. However, I have also made peace with the ambiguity – it was a great friendship for the time it lasted.\nCoincidentally, my first romantic relationship came to an end just five months later. I found it much easier to speak about – years of music, films and books on heartbreak had prepared me well. Since then, I've found that the dissolution of a friendship is less commonly discussed than the end of a romantic relationship.\nHistorically, friendships have received less attention from researchers than other types of relationships, despite being associated with benefits to long-term health, wellbeing, and life satisfaction. Grace Vieth, a researcher in social psychology at the University of Minnesota, studies friendship dissolution. \"I think readers would be surprised [that] we [researchers] are just starting to consider how friendships might end, and that it is a very recent phenomenon… the work is really just beginning,\" she says.\nBecause friendship breakups are generally less talked about, people may feel unsure about how to handle them or the powerful emotions that come with them, Vieth suggests. \"There's a very clear societal script for how to break up with a romantic partner,\" she says. \"But there are no normative scripts on how to go about ending a friendship.\"\nAs children, our primary source of support comes from our parents. But as we get older, especially as we enter adolescence, we start to spend significantly more time with peers, placing a higher priority on social acceptance and social standing, says Kaitlin Flannery, an associate professor in psychology at State University of New York College, Cortland. \"There's a different bond that we have with friends, they help us shape our identity throughout our life. We use our friends as sort of a mirror and a guide.\"\nVieth points out that in its initial stages, friendship is built on similarity and proximity.\n\"We're social creatures. We want acceptance,\" says Flannery. \"We want validation from not only our family, but our same-age peers. And so that's where friendships start to really become these essential sources of social support, but also fun and companionship.\"\nMuch of the research on friendship dissolution has focused on children and adolescents, an age when it is quite common for friendships break apart. In Flannery's research, looking at a sample of 354 middle school students (typically between 11 and 14 years old), 86% said they had a friendship end recently. Most put it down to conflict or a betrayal of trust. Another predictor was the lack of support from friends, or that they felt they weren't getting what was needed from their friends – for example, companionship, or no longer having fun together. Friendship breakups reportedly stirred complex emotions for the middle schoolers, including sadness, but also happiness and relief, depending on why the dissolution happened, how it ended, and who did the \"breaking up\".\nIn some cases, friendships are simply \"downgraded\" from best friend status to \"good\" friends. Another year-long study of friendship stability in seventh graders saw that only about half of \"best friendships\" remained stable throughout the school year. Older adolescents' friendships are moderately more stable over the course over the school year, the research suggests. As one academic paper puts it, for teens, the autumn best friend is very likely to at least be a close friend by spring.\nSuch high school friendships may weaken or dissolve as friends move apart for university and college. This may partly be caused by the physical distance that is introduced between friends at these junctures in life. But, as young adults navigate increasingly complex social networks, as well as their own and others' expectations, friendships can also become less stable.\nAs in the previous life stages, friendship is also an opportunity for young adults to practice getting along with others. One study found for example that people with a \"growth\" mindset about relationships – meaning, the belief that relationships require effort and can grow and develop – were more willing to maintain and work on their friendships. Others may feel that as their interests change, it is more rewarding to spend time with new friends.\n\"I think it's important to recognise that friendship dissolutions are part of life and are very natural,\" says Vieth. \"It's not about the number of friends you have – it's about the closeness and the responsiveness of those friends.\"\nNot all friendship breakups are painful and dramatic. Sometimes, the bond may simply fade. In one study from the 1980s of 90 adults aged 20-28, the five most common reasons cited for a same-sex friendship ending were: less physical proximity; not liking the friend anymore; less interaction; interference from other relationships, such as dating or marriage; and friendships fizzling out naturally. Proximity affected casual friendships the most, while close and best friendships were more likely to end through less interaction or interference from other relationships.\nBut strong friendships can survive and adapt to such life changes, research shows. \"Whenever I look at friendship dissolution, my takeaway is there are certain aspects of life that can disrupt friendships, but there are also just as many examples of friendships that have been able to weather these life changes and grow closer,\" says Vieth.\nGender also influences what we expect from our friendships – and why they may end.\nSurveys of US adults reveal that the majority (66%) say all or most of their close friends are the same gender as them, although women are more likely to say this than men (71% vs. 61%). At high school, friendship among girls tend to intensify around psychological support and closeness, while friendships between boys tend to be based around recreational aspects. \nAnother big gender difference is the way friendships are formed: in pairs, or in groups. Women often have multiple, close one-on-one friendships. Male friends tend to have a denser network, where all their friends are friends with each other. As they tend to be friends in groups, friendship maintenance can be very different for men, Flannery says, whereas it takes more energy for women to maintain one-on-one friendships.\nThis may be why conflict within women's friendships can be more problematic, Flannery adds. \"[Girls and women] tend to hold their friends to higher standards in terms of loyalty and emotional support… [they] reported that they were more sad – they ruminated more, they felt more lonely and were more stressed following a friendship dissolution than boys were,\" says Flannery.\nResearch on conflict resolution suggests that it takes women longer to reconcile with friends after an argument than men, and that the anger they feel takes longer to dissipate. The reasons why friendships end can also differ for men and women. In a study of students at midwestern university in the US, physical separation was more likely to lead to dissolution in men's friendships, while dating or marriage was more likely to interfere with women's friendships. \nSo, should you hold on to old friends, trusting that you'll eventually become close again?\nNot necessarily, say Vieth and Flannery. Sometimes, it can be better to let go. For example, ending a toxic friendship may improve our well-being. \"Sometimes we really over-romanticise friendships\", says Flannery. \"Not all friendships are serving us in positive ways. So, most of the time friendships have great benefits, but we want to make sure that we're selecting friends who are helping us.\" Some friends may make us feel like our cup has been filled, while others leave us tired and drained.\nConsciously ending a friendship can however create another tricky challenge: how to let go of a friend, without hurting them.\nOne controversial but common method is ghosting. Widely known in the dating world as a disappearing act to terminate a romantic relationship while avoiding the confrontation of doing so, ghosting has become a common tool to end friendships, too.\nIn one study of 18 to 25 year-olds, people who had ghosted a friend were asked for their reasons for doing so. The most common motivations were: toxic friendship, loss of interest to maintain the friendship, finding a friend annoying, self-preservation and someone had overstepped boundaries. Although the longevity of the friendship did matter to the ghosters, it didn't prevent them from being a \"gradual ghost\" – that is, gradually pulling away from the friend over a period of time, rather than an abrupt ending. The tactic left the rejected friends feeling \"sadness, frustration and hurt\". Some initiators, however, saw the act of ghosting as a defence mechanism against a bad friendship – and did not feel that a confrontation would help.\nVieth suggests another and perhaps better path forward: learning about what it takes to maintain and improve a friendship – and how to deal with conflict and confrontation.\n\"I think that a lot of people have a mindset that they're willing to work through conflict in romantic relationships, because that's something that we all acknowledge is inevitable,\" she says.\nBut when it comes to friendship, we may just expect things to work out naturally, and give up if they don't: \"I know a lot of people look at [their] friends, and they think these are the relationships that should be easy and bring a lot of joy, fun and laughter into my life,\" she says. \"And that's certainly true, but maybe leads to the idea that sometimes conflict isn't worthwhile [working through].\"\nDespite romantic relationships and friendships sharing similar emotional benefits – such as warmth and joy – they also have a key difference: in a romantic relationship, there tends to be an expectation of monogamy. While this differs across cultures and individual people, generally, the expectation is that you only have one partner, and the rules in that relationship are clear. Whereas \"in friendships, there isn't that expectation of monogamy, which in some case makes it more complicated because we do see friendship jealousy\", says Flannery.\nFriendships are not always mutually exclusive. While we are supposed to be fine with this, we may actually feel uncomfortable about a very close friend having another close friend: \"Because this person is so important to me, but they have someone else who's so important to them,\" says Flannery. It can be helpful to remember that they're allowed to have other friends, and that this doesn't threaten our friendship with them.\nWhile research on friendship psychology is still emerging, these relationhsips take up a lot of attention and energy in our everyday lives. According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, 61% of US adults taking part said having close friends is extremely or very important for people to live a fulfilling life. One reason may be that people are getting married and having children later in life. In both the US and the UK, along with many other places around the world elsewhere, the average age that people marry has risen. In the UK, men and women are now waiting until they are over the age of 30 before marrying for the first time, while in the US the figures are hovering around the same age.\nThat means that for a big part of our life, friends may provide the stability and support that was previously provided by marriage.\nIn romantic relationships, it's not uncommon for couples to break up, and then later, after some reflection, get back together. Is that something we should consider with our ex-friends, too – a reconciliation, and second try? Again, it depends on the nature of the friendship, says Flannery.\n\"I think that there are going to be different situations when that friendship heals versus other times, when maybe it’s better to just let that dissolution take place,\" says Flannery. \"And again, it may depend on: do you feel relieved that the friendship is over? Was that friendship adding positive benefits to your life? If you still feel like you really miss them, maybe it is worth repairing.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more science, technology and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X."]}

Cod liver oil is very nutritious and provides a good amount of vitamins A and D. Inflammation is a natural process that helps the body fight infections and heal injuries.", "Regular fish oil is extracted from the tissue of oily fish like tuna, herring, anchovies, and mackerel, while cod liver oil is extracted from the livers of cod.

This was a seismic bit of news, and not uncontroversial. \"It is a really big call,\" says Constance. \"It really ruffled quite a lot of feathers.", "Last year, the Java stingaree became the first fish to be declared extinct as a result of human actions. Could there soon be others?\nIn the bright coastal waters of Australia, Julia Constance has often sought out stingarees. These flat-bodied fish are like miniature stingrays but different. Stingarees are smaller – and more elusive. \"They're super chill,\" says Constance, a PhD candidate at Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia. They don't swim alongside you like manta rays, she explains, as she recalls snorkelling expeditions that rewarded her with glimpses of the ghostly pale common stingaree.\n\"Once you get good,\" says Constance, \"You can spot them when they're fully buried under the sand.\"\nBut there's one stingaree she probably won't ever see alive, skulking on the seabed. Last December, Constance and colleagues published an assessment of the mysterious Java stinagree, a species not documented by scientists for more than 160 years. It was extinct, Constance and her colleagues declared. And worse, the Java stingaree is the first marine fish considered to have gone extinct due to human activity.\nThis was a seismic bit of news, and not uncontroversial. \"It is a really big call,\" says Constance. \"It really ruffled quite a lot of feathers.\" The Java stingaree is one of those extremely enigmatic species that scientists know very little about. There is only one museum specimen in existence – bought by a German zoologist at a Jakarta fish market in 1862. How, some observers questioned, could we be sure that this really was a distinct species, and that humans were responsible for its disappearance?\nThat single specimen, held by the Natural History Museum in Berlin, is only 33cm (13in) long, including its tail. The colour of its skin has likely faded to what is now a pale brownish hue. It's a female but we don't actually know whether it is a juvenile or an adult, says Constance. To find out, one would have to cut it open and examine its reproductive organs. Since it is the only specimen, that won't be happening, she adds. But it is nonetheless noteworthy. \"It is really, really round for a stingaree,\" says Constance, referring to the disc-like body of the animal.\nIt is so different from any other stingaree, and associated with an area not known to harbour other stingaree species, that we can be confident it is not a hybrid of some sort, Constance explains. Though she adds that she was only able to inspect the specimen from photos because her research took place at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, which prevented her from travelling.\nAs for the judgement that the species is now extinct, and moreover that humans are to blame, Constance says she and her team relied largely on records of fishing industry activity from Indonesia. This included data from extensive surveys carried out at landing sites – places where fishers take their catch onto land, usually to sell it – in the country since 2001.\n\"There was this really, really big push to start documenting the catch of sharks and rays all through Indonesia,\" says Constance. \"The Java stingaree would be really easy to identify if it was there.\"\nBy entering all the information they could find about the stingaree into data analysis tools provided by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Constance and her colleagues found that the organisation's models were 93.5% confident that the Java stingaree had gone extinct. The IUCN, an international organisation that collects and provides information about the status of the world's species, published the results of the assessment on its website.\nDiego Biston Vaz, senior curator of fish at London's Natural History Museum – who was not involved in the assessment – also cites the Indonesian survey data gathered since 2001 and says it \"makes sense\" that the IUCN was able to declare the fish officially extinct last year.\nAnd yet, it remains startling to think that this is the first official marine fish extinction linked to human activity. Humans have caused the disappearance of at least 198 vertebrate species since 1900 – including various fish species found in rivers and lakes. But those species have more or less been confined to land or freshwater – ecosystems that tend to bear the brunt of our activities. In contrast, the planet's seas are vast and we have only just begun exploring the seabed in fine detail.\nOne possible reason that the Java stingaree is the only marine species to have been declared extinct is that marine habitats provide a much better chance for organisms to escape our influence by removing themselves to untouched areas, says Catherine Macdonald at the University of Miami Shark Research and Conservation Program.\n\"Even when we've very heavily influenced coastal environments, there are still parts of the ocean that are historically not that accessible to people,\" says Macdonald.\nMacdonald adds that sharks and rays take a long time to reproduce. Close relatives of the Java stingaree might only produce offspring once or twice a year, at best, says Constance. That means any disruption to the species population from human impacts – such as fishing – could have a devastating effect.\nConstance suggests that the Java stingaree was confined to a relatively small area subject to significant fishing activity. I ask whether it is possible that some disease or other natural event was, instead, responsible for the species' decline. \"We can't say 100%\" one way or another, she admits, though adds: \"I think, overwhelmingly, it was us.\"\nNot all declarations of extinction hold up, though. Constance mentions the case of the smooth handfish, from the coastal waters of Tasmania. It was actually the first fish declared extinct in modern times, in 2018. However, a reassessment in 2021 determined that the data used to back up this declaration was insufficient. The IUCN subsequently relisted the status of the fish as \"unknown\".\nWe should maintain a very high bar for concluding that a species has gone extinct, stresses Riley Pollom, species recovery programme manager at the Seattle Aquarium, because the moment it is considered gone, all conservation efforts stop. If you erroneously declare a species extinct, and measures to protect it evaporate, then – ironically – it might really go extinct as a result of this change in status.\nPollom and Macdonald note that there are multiple shark, ray and skate species around the world currently threatened with extinction, including the Maugean skate in Tasmania; the broad-bodied bowmouth guitarfish of Asia, northern Australia and eastern Africa; and the Indo-Pacific leopard shark.\nAnd while scientists can be fairly confident about the extinction of the Java stingaree, says Pollom, he points out that the sheer scale of the world's oceans means that experts may have missed other extinctions tied to human behaviour. \"Basically, there could be a lot slipping past us without us knowing,\" he says. (Read more from BBC Future about the unknown species in the deep ocean.)\nConstance's search for the Java stingaree is far from over. For one thing, she keeps an eye on museum collections just in case another historical specimen ever turns up. A separate species she has studied lately, a critically endangered type of ray called the Red Sea torpedo, has been preserved in museums – but there are only three known specimens and, for years, one of them had been missing. A curator informed her just last year that they had found it again, she says.\nPlus, this summer Constance was finally able to travel to Jakarta herself to observe operations at two major fish landing sites there, having not previously been able to do so during her research, due to Covid-19 restrictions. She and her colleagues scoured the piles of freshly caught fish for shark and ray species. And she couldn't help but wonder whether she might spot a Java stingaree among the horde.\n\"It's always in the back of my mind – what happens if someone finds it?\" says Constance. But, despite the gravity of her and her colleague's declaration in 2023, she wouldn't be upset or disappointed if the extinction turned out to be a mistake.\n\"We want these things to be surviving into the future,\" says Constance. \"It would be so cool if somebody were to find it someday.\"\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X."]}

They don't swim alongside you like manta rays, she explains, as she recalls snorkelling expeditions that rewarded her with glimpses of the ghostly pale common stingaree.\n\"Once you get good,\" says Constance, \"You can spot them when they're fully buried under the sand.\"\nBut there's one stingaree she probably won't ever see alive, skulking on the seabed. Last December, Constance and colleagues published an assessment of the mysterious Java stinagree, a species not documented by scientists for more than 160 years. It was extinct, Constance and her colleagues declared. And worse, the Java stingaree is the first marine fish considered to have gone extinct due to human activity.\nThis was a seismic bit of news, and not uncontroversial. \"It is a really big call,\" says Constance. \"It really ruffled quite a lot of feathers.\" The Java stingaree is one of those extremely enigmatic species that scientists know very little about. There is only one museum specimen in existence – bought by a German zoologist at a Jakarta fish market in 1862. How, some observers questioned, could we be sure that this really was a distinct species, and that humans were responsible for its disappearance?\nThat single specimen, held by the Natural History Museum in Berlin, is only 33cm (13in) long, including its tail. The colour of its skin has likely faded to what is now a pale brownish hue. It's a female but we don't actually know whether it is a juvenile or an adult, says Constance. To find out, one would have to cut it open and examine its reproductive organs. Since it is the only specimen, that won't be happening, she adds. But it is nonetheless noteworthy. \"It is really, really round for a stingaree,\" says Constance, referring to the disc-like body of the animal.\nIt is so different from any other stingaree, and associated with an area not known to harbour other stingaree species, that we can be confident it is not a hybrid of some sort, Constance explains. Though she adds that she was only able to inspect the specimen from photos because her research took place at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, which prevented her from travelling.\nAs for the judgement that the species is now extinct, and moreover that humans are to blame, Constance says she and her team relied largely on records of fishing industry activity from Indonesia. This included data from extensive surveys carried out at landing sites – places where fishers take their catch onto land, usually to sell it – in the country since 2001.\n\"There was this really, really big push to start documenting the catch of sharks and rays all through Indonesia,\" says Constance. \"The Java stingaree would be really easy to identify if it was there.\"\nBy entering all the information they could find about the stingaree into data analysis tools provided by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Constance and her colleagues found that the organisation's models were 93.5% confident that the Java stingaree had gone extinct. The IUCN, an international organisation that collects and provides information about the status of the world's species, published the results of the assessment on its website.\nDiego Biston Vaz, senior curator of fish at London's Natural History Museum – who was not involved in the assessment – also cites the Indonesian survey data gathered since 2001 and says it \"makes sense\" that the IUCN was able to declare the fish officially extinct last year.\nAnd yet, it remains startling to think that this is the first official marine fish extinction linked to human activity. Humans have caused the disappearance of at least 198 vertebrate species since 1900 – including various fish species found in rivers and lakes. But those species have more or less been confined to land or freshwater – ecosystems that tend to bear the brunt of our activities. In contrast, the planet's seas are vast and we have only just begun exploring the seabed in fine detail.\nOne possible reason that the Java stingaree is the only marine species to have been declared extinct is that marine habitats provide a much better chance for organisms to escape our influence by removing themselves to untouched areas, says Catherine Macdonald at the University of Miami Shark Research and Conservation Program.\n\"Even when we've very heavily influenced coastal environments, there are still parts of the ocean that are historically not that accessible to people,\" says Macdonald.\nMacdonald adds that sharks and rays take a long time to reproduce. Close relatives of the Java stingaree might only produce offspring once or twice a year, at best, says Constance. That means any disruption to the species population from human impacts – such as fishing – could have a devastating effect.\nConstance suggests that the Java stingaree was confined to a relatively small area subject to significant fishing activity. I ask whether it is possible that some disease or other natural event was, instead, responsible for the species' decline. \"We can't say 100%\" one way or another, she admits, though adds: \"I think, overwhelmingly, it was us.\"\nNot all declarations of extinction hold up, though. Constance mentions the case of the smooth handfish, from the coastal waters of Tasmania. It was actually the first fish declared extinct in modern times, in 2018. However, a reassessment in 2021 determined that the data used to back up this declaration was insufficient. The IUCN subsequently relisted the status of the fish as \"unknown\".\nWe should maintain a very high bar for concluding that a species has gone extinct, stresses Riley Pollom, species recovery programme manager at the Seattle Aquarium, because the moment it is considered gone, all conservation efforts stop. If you erroneously declare a species extinct, and measures to protect it evaporate, then – ironically – it might really go extinct as a result of this change in status.\nPollom and Macdonald note that there are multiple shark, ray and skate species around the world currently threatened with extinction, including the Maugean skate in Tasmania; the broad-bodied bowmouth guitarfish of Asia, northern Australia and eastern Africa; and the Indo-Pacific leopard shark.\nAnd while scientists can be fairly confident about the extinction of the Java stingaree, says Pollom, he points out that the sheer scale of the world's oceans means that experts may have missed other extinctions tied to human behaviour. \"Basically, there could be a lot slipping past us without us knowing,\" he says. (Read more from BBC Future about the unknown species in the deep ocean.)\nConstance's search for the Java stingaree is far from over. For one thing, she keeps an eye on museum collections just in case another historical specimen ever turns up. A separate species she has studied lately, a critically endangered type of ray called the Red Sea torpedo, has been preserved in museums – but there are only three known specimens and, for years, one of them had been missing. A curator informed her just last year that they had found it again, she says.\nPlus, this summer Constance was finally able to travel to Jakarta herself to observe operations at two major fish landing sites there, having not previously been able to do so during her research, due to Covid-19 restrictions. She and her colleagues scoured the piles of freshly caught fish for shark and ray species. And she couldn't help but wonder whether she might spot a Java stingaree among the horde.\n\"It's always in the back of my mind – what happens if someone finds it?\" says Constance. But, despite the gravity of her and her colleague's declaration in 2023, she wouldn't be upset or disappointed if the extinction turned out to be a mistake.\n\"We want these things to be surviving into the future,\" says Constance. \"It would be so cool if somebody were to find it someday.\"\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X."]}

In a groundbreaking moment for the art world, Sotheby's will auction the first-ever artwork created by a humanoid robot.", "Artificial intelligence is being used to generate paintings, images and even sculptures, with some selling for thousands of dollars. Do we need to reframe our definition of art?\nIn the drawing room of a stately home in rural Oxfordshire, I watch on as a dungaree-clad artist slowly and deliberately puts pen to paper. Her arm moves across the canvas, the marks gradually coalescing into an abstract portrait of herself.\nIt seems like a moment of creative expression. But this is no ordinary artist – she is the world's first humanoid robot artist, Ai-Da. By design, her very existence brings into question how we define art, and who, or in this case, what, can create it.\nWill AI algorithms and robots like Ai-Da spell the end of human creativity and artistry, or can they be harnessed to augment our own creative potential?\nArt in flux\nWhen Marcel Duchamp proposed that a porcelain urinal be considered art and submitted it for exhibition in early 20th-Century New York, he flipped the art world on its head. He argued that anything could be considered as art, if chosen by the artist and labelled as such. It was a profoundly revolutionary thought which challenged previous notions of art as beautiful, technically skilful and emotive.\nIn much the same way, AI-created artworks are disrupting the accepted norms of the art world. As philosopher Alice Helliwell from Northeastern University London argues, if we can consider radical and divergent pieces like Duchamp's urinal and Tracey Emin's bed as art proper, how can something created by a generative algorithm be dismissed? After all, both were controversial at the time and contain objects that haven't technically been created by an \"artist's\" hand.\n\"Historically, the way we understand the definition of art has shifted,\" says Heliwell. \"It is hard to see why a urinal can be art, but art made by a generative algorithm could not be.\"\nThroughout history, every radical artistic movement has been intimately connected to the cultural zeitgeist of the time, a reflection of society's preoccupations and concerns, like Turner and his industrial landscapes and Da Vinci's obsession with science and mathematics. AI is no different. Ai-Da's creators, gallerist Aidan Meller and researcher Lucy Seal cite this as a pivotal reason for the existence of a humanoid artist like Ai-Da. She is the personification of one of contemporary society's current fears, the rise of job-snatching AI algorithms and potential robot domination.\nBut technological revolutions like artificial intelligence need not signify the \"end of art\" as many fear. Instead, they can help to kickstart an artistic metamorphosis and move us towards totally different ways of seeing and creating, something Marcus du Sautoy, a mathematician at the University of Oxford and author of The Creativity Code: Art and Innovation in the Age of AI, would contend.\nHumans are just as prone to behaving like machines, repeating old behaviours and getting bogged down with rules, like a painter or musician locked into a particular style. \"AI might help us to stop behaving like machines…and kick us into being creative again as humans,\" says du Sautoy. He sees it as a powerful collaborator in the pursuit of human creativity.\nThere is historical precedence for new technology liberating us from our creative shackles. Take the invention of photography in the 1800s for example. Some artists saw the camera as the antithesis of an artist, and photographs as the mortal enemy of the art establishment.\nBut instead of replacing painting, photography became a catalyst in the development of the experimental modern art movement of the 20th Century, as artists moved away from realism towards abstraction, a shift that paved the way for the contemporary art of today.\nWho's the artist?\nWalking around Ai-Da's country pile in Oxfordshire I got to appreciate the sheer breadth of her artworks to-date. Unsettling busts of herself with her eyes stapled shut, scarab beetles fused to her face; partial and ethereal depictions of computer scientist Alan Turing; and colourful pop-art inspired portraits of Glastonbury headliners. \nUnlike the numerous text-to-image generators like Dall-E and Midjourney that have the ability to create alarmingly plausible magazine front covers and win coveted art competitions, Ai-Da's artistic process doesn't rely solely upon the data on which she has been trained. (Find out more about AI training in this simple guide to machine learning.)\nAi-Da also makes use of the cameras in her eyes, which feed novel images into her algorithm, thereby creating new and unique works far removed from human-generated datasets. This is how she's able to create self-portraiture. Does this make her creative in her own right? And can we credit her with authorship, or does this reside with the artists upon whose work she's been trained and with the creators of her algorithm, who ultimately wrote her code?\nMargaret Boden, a researcher in cognitive science at the University of Sussex in the UK, has developed one of the most widely accepted definitions of creativity to date. She sees it as the ability to generate ideas that are new, valuable and surprising. Using this definition, the works produced by machines like Ai-Da could be considered creative, argue her creators. Whether or not an algorithm or a robot itself can be described as a creative entity, an 'artist' in its own right, like a human, remains up for debate, and this in part comes down to authorship. \nQuestions of authorship and data ownership plague the artificial intelligence narrative. Artists Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst, who recently held an exhibition exploring collaborative artwork in the age of AI at London's Serpentine Gallery, want to confront the issue of data misuse and authorship in AI. The pair co-founded Spawning AI, a suite of tools aimed at empowering human creators to both prohibit AI from using their works and to find whether works of theirs have already been referenced in AI generated work.\nPlagiarism is a legitimate concern for many artists as their work is used to train algorithms but also can then be copied in the works that generative AI tools produce.\nBut there are also artists who see AI as a new outlet for their own creativity – a fresh medium they can wield much like a brush or palette knife. Some artists, such as Sougwen Chung, are now exclusively training algorithms on their works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries.\nThere is another argument at the heart of this issue too. The machine-learning processes used to train generative AI algorithms may be a creative process in themselves.\n\"Code exposed to data – existing artworks, for example – is able to learn, mutate and evolve,\" says du Sautoy. \"It means that the code by the end of this learning process is very different from the original code written by the human. This means that there is a chance for the code to produce something that... deserves to be called the creativity of the code rather than the human who started the process.\n\"It's a bit like Picasso is made from the DNA of his parents but it is his learning and exposure to the world that resulted in his creativity. You would never credit that to the parents even though everything started with their code or DNA.\" (Learn more about machine learning and some of the other terms you need to understand AI better.)\nPowerful algorithms called Creative Adversarial Networks (Cans) also now exist, designed to deliberately create something that goes against the patterns in the training data, breaking with the style of the art upon which it's been trained. This is leading to AIs that generate very surprising results. \"Many machine learning algorithms are 'black boxes',\" says Helliwell. \"We do not fully know what is happening inside the system, even if we have designed it ourselves.\"\nThis is a common and unsettling problem throughout the AI world. How can we trust the decisions or outputs from an AI if we don't understand how it got there in the first place? (Read more about why humans may never understand AI.)\nIs art uniquely human?\nThe prospect of truly artistic machines is also challenging another long-held belief about what makes us human. Art has long been seen as a uniquely human endeavour. Made by humans, for aesthetic appreciation by other humans, artworks themselves are imbued with the emotions of their creators. It is a visual representation of their desires and fears, frustrations and reverence, or at the very least their need to create for practical, economical and emotional reasons.\nSo, can we consider the creations of non-human entities to be art by the same definition? There are some who believe that animals already produce forms of art. And research has shown that pigeons seem to be able to discriminate between different types of artwork.\nIt all comes down to intent, this is \"what truly distinguishes the creativity of the human and the machine\", says du Sautoy. \"No machine is driven to express itself creatively. It is prompted by the intention of the human.\"\nDoes this mean AI is not yet fully capable of creating true art? After all, computer algorithms lack any real-world experience and robots like Ai-Da, although capable of self-portraiture, don't actually possess self-awareness. This question remains hotly contested. For Helliwell a lack of intent shouldn't necessarily preclude AI works from being considered art.\nMore like this:\nAnd perhaps that is what it comes down to. Art, goes the idiom, is in the eye of the beholder. As humans, for example, we identify patterns and admire the artistry evident in the natural world – the intricate web of a spider, the decorative plumage of a peacock. We often refer to bird calls as music and the mating displays of some animals as dance. There are numerous examples of animals exhibiting creative behaviours that we might label artistic. The Bower bird and pufferfish play with perspective, symmetry and colour in much the same way a human artist might, for example. And while these animals may not necessarily be intentionally creating these to be enjoyed as works of art, their actions are no less intentional in their pursuit of attracting a mate or warding off competitors.\nWhat's the future?\nHowever we look to define art or the artist, it's clear that AI algorithms and machines like Ai-Da are having an impact on the art world. Their works are exhibited alongside more traditional forms of art in established art institutions worldwide. Next year we'll see the world's first AI art gallery open its doors in LA, a permanent exhibition space for \"ethical AI\".\nEva Jäger, the creative AI lead and arts technologies curator at the Serpentine Gallery in London, is also helping to bring AI art to the masses, with a programme of exhibitions provoking critical discussion about the impact of technology on art.\nFor her, the future of AI art is not adversarial. Traditional forms of art will continue to exist, just as AI artwork will continue to develop. She sees the collaboration between human and machine as a space for real creative potential. She believes that the artist's intent and the human practice behind a piece or installation which utilises technology like AI are more important than just the final aesthetics.\n\"For me there are some really interesting generative images that get produced, but without the practice behind it I'm not sold on them, just because they're an amazing image,\" she says. \"And I would say the same about painting. I’m much more interested in the systems, including the humans behind the work. I want to know what they are using the system for, what are they exploring? It's a mistake just to look at the final artefact.\"\nAnd when it comes to evaluating the authenticity and credibility of AI art, one of the most contentious aspects of the AI art discipline, du Sautoy makes a compelling point. All art is a product of that which came before it, and creativity cannot come from nothing – all artists whether human, robot or algorithm, build upon the works of others.\n\"Too many people discuss creativity as if it is some uniquely human magical process, that it conjures something from nothing like a magician,\" says du Sautoy. \"But that is just because we don't understand our own creativity.\"\n-- \nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X."]}

The work to bore the shafts began in 2000.", "Nuclear waste remains toxic for thousands of years. How do you build a storage facility that will keep it safely buried for millennia?\nIt is a chilly day early in the summer. But 1,500ft (450m) beneath the rolling hills of the Champagne region in northeastern France, it feels much warmer.\nThis facility's fluorescent lights are bright, and the air is dry. I can taste the dust in the atmosphere. The heavy emergency respirators I have to lug with me are a reminder of the dangers I might face this far underground.\nThen I start to become disorientated by the rough, criss-crossing rocky passages of the underground laboratory, the hum of hidden electronic equipment and the lack of people. How do I get back to the lift?\nI turn a corner, and there in front of me is a huge chamber, so large that I think for a moment that I have stumbled into a tomb of the pharaohs. But it hasn't been built by the Ancient Egyptians. It was instead carved out of the rock as a burial place for some of the most radioactive substances on Earth: intermediate and high-level nuclear waste.\nHow do you go about designing, building and operating structures that take decades to plan and even longer to build, that operate over centuries and must survive for 100,000 years, and that contain some of the most dangerous materials on the planet?\nFour hours' drive east of Paris, the 2.4km (1.5 miles) of tunnels are home to countless scientific experiments, construction technique testing and technological innovations. France's National Radioactive Waste Agency (Andra) needs these to demonstrate to the regulators if it is to be awarded a licence to build a geological disposal facility (GDF) next to the tunnels. \nGeological disposal facilities for nuclear waste are, or will be, some of the largest underground structures humanity has ever built. They are planned, in development, about to start construction or about to open in the UK, France, Sweden, Finland and around 20 other countries.  \nFinland was the first country in the world to build a deep geological disposal facility for spent fuel, and it has now conducted the first stage of the trial disposal of the fuel. In Sweden, construction of a GDF is about to start at Forsmark, two hours' drive north of Stockholm, and a similar facility, Ciego, is expected to be built in France relatively soon. In Britain a possible site for such storage has yet to be chosen. \nGDFs are epically large, expensive and controversial underground structures designed to contain the most radioactive and long-lived waste produced by the nuclear industry. Currently stored on the surface in facilities such as that at Sellafield in the UK, and at La Hague in France, this waste can include components of nuclear reactors, graphite from reactor cores, spent fuel and the liquid byproduct from the reprocessing of spent fuel from nuclear reactors. \nOn a computer screen, the plan for any GDF like this looks like a huge, multi-level nuclear shelter. But the process of designing, constructing and operating such a facility occurs on a timescale that is suitably pharaonic. Like the workers who built the pyramids, many of the engineers working on these monumental structures will never see their work completed.\n\"The licensing for one of these high-level waste disposal facilities takes over 20 to 30 years – we haven't seen any country taking less time,\" says Jacques Delay, my guide and a scientist at the facility in France, \"and then the operation will last for around 100 years before it is sealed.\" After that, there will be hundreds of years of monitoring of the site.\n\"The key to siting a GDF is to find a suitable site and a willing host community,\" says Amy Shelton, a principal community engagement manager for the UK's Nuclear Waste Services (NWS). \"But everything starts with the geology.\"\nIn countries across Europe, engineers such as Shelton pore over the available geological data for a potential location to see if the rocks buried around 500m to 1km (1,650 to 3,300ft) down are suitable to confine nuclear waste for more than 100,000 years. Rocks like granite and clay are the best for this. But there may be simply not enough data to make a safe decision.\nA promising site may turn out to be too close to vital aquifers that supply fresh water to local communities, or to the side of a valley, which in 10,000 years' time may mean it's at risk from an advancing glacier, and the hunt has to start again.\nIt is easier in some countries than others to find a site. \"The Swedish [and Finnish] bedrock is in terms of seismic activity very stable,\" says Anna Porelius, communications director at SKB, the organisation which manages Sweden's nuclear waste. \"It has been a continuous entity... for more than 900 million years. In addition, no new fracture zones form anymore.\" \nSometimes the human geography is the problem. \"Many of the communities who volunteered were absolutely unrealistic, such as they were too close to suburbs of Paris,\" says Delay. \"Imagine building a nuclear waste disposal facility in Harrow or Wimbledon!\"\nCommunities volunteer to host a GDF for reasons such as the promise of much-needed investment and well-paid jobs. Their consent is needed at every step of the way. This may in turn depend on their experience of the nuclear industry to date.\nIn Britain that experience hasn't been the best. In Finland, it is a different story. \"We have been making nuclear electricity since the late '70s,\" says Pasi Tuohimaa of Posiva Oy, Finland's nuclear waste disposal company. \"People know the safety culture; they have family members and neighbours who have been working on the site. So they understand about waste.\"\nGet this wrong, and demonstrations against a GDF can quickly erupt. \"During the process in Sweden, SKB learnt valuable lessons about the importance of a positive response to its plans from the local population,\" says Porelius. \"Protests took place in a number of places and at Almunge… against SKB's [test] drillings.\"\nGiven the problems in finding a site, it may seem easier, and cheaper, to store this nuclear waste in a disused mine, as Germany did in the 1960s and 1970s with its low-level radioactive waste. \"It's a perfectly understandable and natural question to ask: 'Well, we've got these things, so why don't we reuse them?'\" says Neil Hyatt, the chief scientist at NWS. \"But they have not been built for our purpose – or for the long term, or with nuclear safety in mind.\"\nCertainly, mines were not built with the precision needed for the storage of high-level nuclear waste. \"The ramp down to the bottom of the repository is estimated to take… five years to complete,\" says Porelius. \"That is a very long time compared to traditional mining operations.\"\nIf a GDF is built where there are still mineral resources to exploit then the chance that the \"nuclear tomb\" will be disturbed in the future is increased, regardless of whether there is currently mining activity. The last tin mine closed in Cornwall in 1998, but 26 years later Cornish Lithium is planning to extract lithium from the historical mining district due to the demand for electric vehicles.  \nIt might also simply be easier to construct a new purpose-built facility for nuclear waste. \"In Finland we are used to building underground to escape the weather,\" says Tuohimaa. \"Building a new facility allows us to plan the whole site from scratch.\"\nUnlike, say, designing a new Airbus airliner, there are few examples to follow when it comes to designing a GDF. Still, it's clear the design will also be all about the geology.\n\"The design of a GDF is primarily shaped by the thickness of the rock formation,\" says Delay, \"which in this case [of France's planned GDF] is enough for just one level rather the two or three or four as originally planned.\"\nThen there is the nature and volume of the waste, and the amount of heat it generates. Intermediate waste produces less heat and so it can be stored safely, with containers stacked relatively close together in large vaults. High-level nuclear waste produces a great deal more heat, and must be stored in small amounts, far apart.\nThere is also the need for physical barriers to stop radiation from escaping from the GDF, which can range from the design of the containers to the type of rock that surrounds it. But critics fear these barriers may fail over time.\nLifts can seem an attractive way to haul the waste down to its final resting place around 500m (1650ft) underground, but that raises alarming scenarios of a container stuck in a lift or lifts plummeting to the bottom of a shaft. A ramp with a slope of around 12% may be safer because systems can be put into place to stop a sledge running out of control. It may be best to build both.\nOne solution to the challenge of building a GDF is to work on a shared design with other nations. This is what the Swedes and Finns did, and they called it the KBS3. \"They knew wherever they dig the rock is going to be hard so… the choices were basically laid out for them already,\" says Hyatt. \"Whereas we [in the UK] are still choosing the target geology.\"\nThe designers' biggest headaches may result from a simple equation: the speed of technological change versus the length of the project. \"This timescale means it's impossible to know if we will be using this technology [to contain the waste] in 20 to 200 years' time,\" says Delay. \"But we have to demonstrate today that we have a solution to these problems in the future.\"\nFrench engineers have built a funicular for a 4km (2.5 mile) ramp to prove the safety features needed to stop a runaway container. They have also shown how a robot like Boston Dynamics' autonomous robot dogs could \"without any human intervention be used to move waste canisters knocked out of place by an unexpected event like an earthquake,\" says Delay. \nThe engineers have, he adds, even developed a robot to \"recover a cannister from a corroded cell\" by crawling along the long, narrow, claustrophobic tunnels that will contain high-level nuclear waste. Its job will be to clear any blockage and pull the cylindrical waste containers to safety.\nIn Sweden, plans are further advanced. According to Porelius: \"Sometime during the 2080s the repository will comprise something like 60km (37 miles) of tunnels with room for more than 6,000 copper canisters of spent nuclear fuel… The deposition of the nuclear waste will be done by custom-designed machines that can be remotely operated with great precision. \n\"Magne is one example of a prototype machine that we have built,\" adds Porelius. \"The machine will be used to place the copper canisters in the deposition holes 500m (1,650ft) down in the bedrock.\"\nMore like this:• The place where no humans will tread for 100,000 years• How to build a nuclear warning for 10,000 years' time• The long shadow cast by Chernobyl \nBut technology rarely evolves how we expect it to. \"It'd be foolish to think that you could rely on today's technology in a facility with the timescale of a GDF,\" says Hyatt. \"So, we must design the facility to be repairable, upgradable, replaceable and resilient.\" \nThe designers of a GDF must contend with one more complication: the principle of retrievability. In France there is a legal requirement that any waste that is deposited in the GDF during its operational phase can be retrieved safely. In Britain, it's more a general guiding principle.\nBut the process of retrieval becomes progressively more difficult as each vault is sealed, until the entirely facility is sealed for good. \nOthers are more sanguine about it. \"We are burying the fuel spent fuel for good, but there is also reversibility,\" says Tuohimaa. \"When it's sealed, it's sealed… but the world may look very different in 100 years' time. \" For Delay, \"when it's sealed it is a question for society not technicians\".\nIn the end, the timescales are hard to grasp when it comes to nuclear storage, and these projects will take hundreds of years to complete. So what motivates these in-demand specialists today to work on a project they are unlikely to see completed?\n\"For most of us it's the sense of purpose,\" says Porelius. \"None of us might see the project of the final repository completed, but what we do now and how well we execute the solution of nuclear waste affects the coming generations.

To a certain degree, this was a continuation of the “bury and forget about it” principle, applied to the less radioactive and thus less dangerous waste – radioactive waste.", "(Photo: Posiva Oy) Following several decades of committed implementation of disposal strategies in Finland and Sweden, as well as cooperation in the development of a safe disposal solution based on a Swedish design, the first ever deep geological repository for spent fuel is being constructed in Olkiluoto, Finland.", "Everybody knew of the idea of a geological repository for high-level radioactive nuclear waste, but Finland did it.” This deep geological disposal facility is being built in Olkiluoto, off the south-west coast of Finland, near one of the country’s nuclear power plants.", "The experiences of the countries making significant progress on their DGRs does suggest that early efforts to demonstrate both technical and social feasibility are the cornerstones of progress towards geological disposal.

What would happen if all the materials we extract from the ground suddenly became off-limits? Before the Prius and Tesla, came the EV1 - the world's first mass-produced electric car.", "Nuclear waste remains toxic for thousands of years. How do you build a storage facility that will keep it safely buried for millennia?\nIt is a chilly day early in the summer. But 1,500ft (450m) beneath the rolling hills of the Champagne region in northeastern France, it feels much warmer.\nThis facility's fluorescent lights are bright, and the air is dry. I can taste the dust in the atmosphere. The heavy emergency respirators I have to lug with me are a reminder of the dangers I might face this far underground.\nThen I start to become disorientated by the rough, criss-crossing rocky passages of the underground laboratory, the hum of hidden electronic equipment and the lack of people. How do I get back to the lift?\nI turn a corner, and there in front of me is a huge chamber, so large that I think for a moment that I have stumbled into a tomb of the pharaohs. But it hasn't been built by the Ancient Egyptians. It was instead carved out of the rock as a burial place for some of the most radioactive substances on Earth: intermediate and high-level nuclear waste.\nHow do you go about designing, building and operating structures that take decades to plan and even longer to build, that operate over centuries and must survive for 100,000 years, and that contain some of the most dangerous materials on the planet?\nFour hours' drive east of Paris, the 2.4km (1.5 miles) of tunnels are home to countless scientific experiments, construction technique testing and technological innovations. France's National Radioactive Waste Agency (Andra) needs these to demonstrate to the regulators if it is to be awarded a licence to build a geological disposal facility (GDF) next to the tunnels. \nGeological disposal facilities for nuclear waste are, or will be, some of the largest underground structures humanity has ever built. They are planned, in development, about to start construction or about to open in the UK, France, Sweden, Finland and around 20 other countries.  \nFinland was the first country in the world to build a deep geological disposal facility for spent fuel, and it has now conducted the first stage of the trial disposal of the fuel. In Sweden, construction of a GDF is about to start at Forsmark, two hours' drive north of Stockholm, and a similar facility, Ciego, is expected to be built in France relatively soon. In Britain a possible site for such storage has yet to be chosen. \nGDFs are epically large, expensive and controversial underground structures designed to contain the most radioactive and long-lived waste produced by the nuclear industry. Currently stored on the surface in facilities such as that at Sellafield in the UK, and at La Hague in France, this waste can include components of nuclear reactors, graphite from reactor cores, spent fuel and the liquid byproduct from the reprocessing of spent fuel from nuclear reactors. \nOn a computer screen, the plan for any GDF like this looks like a huge, multi-level nuclear shelter. But the process of designing, constructing and operating such a facility occurs on a timescale that is suitably pharaonic. Like the workers who built the pyramids, many of the engineers working on these monumental structures will never see their work completed.\n\"The licensing for one of these high-level waste disposal facilities takes over 20 to 30 years – we haven't seen any country taking less time,\" says Jacques Delay, my guide and a scientist at the facility in France, \"and then the operation will last for around 100 years before it is sealed.\" After that, there will be hundreds of years of monitoring of the site.\n\"The key to siting a GDF is to find a suitable site and a willing host community,\" says Amy Shelton, a principal community engagement manager for the UK's Nuclear Waste Services (NWS). \"But everything starts with the geology.\"\nIn countries across Europe, engineers such as Shelton pore over the available geological data for a potential location to see if the rocks buried around 500m to 1km (1,650 to 3,300ft) down are suitable to confine nuclear waste for more than 100,000 years. Rocks like granite and clay are the best for this. But there may be simply not enough data to make a safe decision.\nA promising site may turn out to be too close to vital aquifers that supply fresh water to local communities, or to the side of a valley, which in 10,000 years' time may mean it's at risk from an advancing glacier, and the hunt has to start again.\nIt is easier in some countries than others to find a site. \"The Swedish [and Finnish] bedrock is in terms of seismic activity very stable,\" says Anna Porelius, communications director at SKB, the organisation which manages Sweden's nuclear waste. \"It has been a continuous entity... for more than 900 million years. In addition, no new fracture zones form anymore.\" \nSometimes the human geography is the problem. \"Many of the communities who volunteered were absolutely unrealistic, such as they were too close to suburbs of Paris,\" says Delay. \"Imagine building a nuclear waste disposal facility in Harrow or Wimbledon!\"\nCommunities volunteer to host a GDF for reasons such as the promise of much-needed investment and well-paid jobs. Their consent is needed at every step of the way. This may in turn depend on their experience of the nuclear industry to date.\nIn Britain that experience hasn't been the best. In Finland, it is a different story. \"We have been making nuclear electricity since the late '70s,\" says Pasi Tuohimaa of Posiva Oy, Finland's nuclear waste disposal company. \"People know the safety culture; they have family members and neighbours who have been working on the site. So they understand about waste.\"\nGet this wrong, and demonstrations against a GDF can quickly erupt. \"During the process in Sweden, SKB learnt valuable lessons about the importance of a positive response to its plans from the local population,\" says Porelius. \"Protests took place in a number of places and at Almunge… against SKB's [test] drillings.\"\nGiven the problems in finding a site, it may seem easier, and cheaper, to store this nuclear waste in a disused mine, as Germany did in the 1960s and 1970s with its low-level radioactive waste. \"It's a perfectly understandable and natural question to ask: 'Well, we've got these things, so why don't we reuse them?'\" says Neil Hyatt, the chief scientist at NWS. \"But they have not been built for our purpose – or for the long term, or with nuclear safety in mind.\"\nCertainly, mines were not built with the precision needed for the storage of high-level nuclear waste. \"The ramp down to the bottom of the repository is estimated to take… five years to complete,\" says Porelius. \"That is a very long time compared to traditional mining operations.\"\nIf a GDF is built where there are still mineral resources to exploit then the chance that the \"nuclear tomb\" will be disturbed in the future is increased, regardless of whether there is currently mining activity. The last tin mine closed in Cornwall in 1998, but 26 years later Cornish Lithium is planning to extract lithium from the historical mining district due to the demand for electric vehicles.  \nIt might also simply be easier to construct a new purpose-built facility for nuclear waste. \"In Finland we are used to building underground to escape the weather,\" says Tuohimaa. \"Building a new facility allows us to plan the whole site from scratch.\"\nUnlike, say, designing a new Airbus airliner, there are few examples to follow when it comes to designing a GDF. Still, it's clear the design will also be all about the geology.\n\"The design of a GDF is primarily shaped by the thickness of the rock formation,\" says Delay, \"which in this case [of France's planned GDF] is enough for just one level rather the two or three or four as originally planned.\"\nThen there is the nature and volume of the waste, and the amount of heat it generates. Intermediate waste produces less heat and so it can be stored safely, with containers stacked relatively close together in large vaults. High-level nuclear waste produces a great deal more heat, and must be stored in small amounts, far apart.\nThere is also the need for physical barriers to stop radiation from escaping from the GDF, which can range from the design of the containers to the type of rock that surrounds it. But critics fear these barriers may fail over time.\nLifts can seem an attractive way to haul the waste down to its final resting place around 500m (1650ft) underground, but that raises alarming scenarios of a container stuck in a lift or lifts plummeting to the bottom of a shaft. A ramp with a slope of around 12% may be safer because systems can be put into place to stop a sledge running out of control. It may be best to build both.\nOne solution to the challenge of building a GDF is to work on a shared design with other nations. This is what the Swedes and Finns did, and they called it the KBS3. \"They knew wherever they dig the rock is going to be hard so… the choices were basically laid out for them already,\" says Hyatt. \"Whereas we [in the UK] are still choosing the target geology.\"\nThe designers' biggest headaches may result from a simple equation: the speed of technological change versus the length of the project. \"This timescale means it's impossible to know if we will be using this technology [to contain the waste] in 20 to 200 years' time,\" says Delay. \"But we have to demonstrate today that we have a solution to these problems in the future.\"\nFrench engineers have built a funicular for a 4km (2.5 mile) ramp to prove the safety features needed to stop a runaway container. They have also shown how a robot like Boston Dynamics' autonomous robot dogs could \"without any human intervention be used to move waste canisters knocked out of place by an unexpected event like an earthquake,\" says Delay. \nThe engineers have, he adds, even developed a robot to \"recover a cannister from a corroded cell\" by crawling along the long, narrow, claustrophobic tunnels that will contain high-level nuclear waste. Its job will be to clear any blockage and pull the cylindrical waste containers to safety.\nIn Sweden, plans are further advanced. According to Porelius: \"Sometime during the 2080s the repository will comprise something like 60km (37 miles) of tunnels with room for more than 6,000 copper canisters of spent nuclear fuel… The deposition of the nuclear waste will be done by custom-designed machines that can be remotely operated with great precision. \n\"Magne is one example of a prototype machine that we have built,\" adds Porelius. \"The machine will be used to place the copper canisters in the deposition holes 500m (1,650ft) down in the bedrock.\"\nMore like this:• The place where no humans will tread for 100,000 years• How to build a nuclear warning for 10,000 years' time• The long shadow cast by Chernobyl \nBut technology rarely evolves how we expect it to. \"It'd be foolish to think that you could rely on today's technology in a facility with the timescale of a GDF,\" says Hyatt. \"So, we must design the facility to be repairable, upgradable, replaceable and resilient.\" \nThe designers of a GDF must contend with one more complication: the principle of retrievability. In France there is a legal requirement that any waste that is deposited in the GDF during its operational phase can be retrieved safely. In Britain, it's more a general guiding principle.\nBut the process of retrieval becomes progressively more difficult as each vault is sealed, until the entirely facility is sealed for good. \nOthers are more sanguine about it. \"We are burying the fuel spent fuel for good, but there is also reversibility,\" says Tuohimaa. \"When it's sealed, it's sealed… but the world may look very different in 100 years' time. \" For Delay, \"when it's sealed it is a question for society not technicians\".\nIn the end, the timescales are hard to grasp when it comes to nuclear storage, and these projects will take hundreds of years to complete. So what motivates these in-demand specialists today to work on a project they are unlikely to see completed?\n\"For most of us it's the sense of purpose,\" says Porelius. \"None of us might see the project of the final repository completed, but what we do now and how well we execute the solution of nuclear waste affects the coming generations. Doing that well… gives us the motivation to go forward.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X."]}

{"id": 42, "question": "What is the name given to the most diverse marine habitat in the world?", "answer": ["The coral triangle"], "doc": ["It is home to over 600 reef-building coral species (75 percent of all species known to science); 3,000 species of reef fish (40 percent of the world’s coral reef species); 6 of the world’s 7 marine turtle species; and three-quarters of known molluscs. Why this region is the global epicenter for marine diversity is still in debate.", "Although coral reefs exist throughout the tropics, there is one area that is the epicenter for marine diversity. The Coral Triangle is the most diverse and biologically complex marine ecosystem on the planet. It spans across parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Timor Leste. Covering 5.", "Coral reefs are considered to be the most biologically diverse of all marine ecosystems, supporting an estimated 25 percent of all marine life and 32 of the current 34 existing animal phyla. Yet they cover a mere 0.2 percent of the ocean floor.", "Although they often receive little attention, they are one of the most productive ecosystems in the world. Seagrasses provide shelter and food to an incredibly diverse community of animals, from tiny invertebrates to large fish, crabs, turtles, marine mammals and birds.", "Coral reefs are considered rainforests of the sea. They are the most biologically diverse marine ecosystems, yet they only cover a small portion of the ocean floor and many of their inhabitants remain a mystery.", "Researchers are unlocking the ancient secrets of the world's most diverse marine habitat. Could their discoveries help us save our oceans?\nIn an office wing of the Natural History Museum in London, two researchers slide open a plain storage cupboard door to reveal a hidden treasure: shelves of fossilised corals, up to 30 million years old, from the world's most diverse marine habitat. Some look like petrified brains, others like rocks with filigrane patterns.\n\"I like to look at things in the past and see if we can learn lessons from them,\" says Ken Johnson, with an eye on the fossils. Johnson is a palaeontologist and principal researcher at the museum's Earth Sciences department. Next to him stands Nadia Santodomingo, a marine biologist and geoscientist, and curator at the museum. They and their team collected the fossils in Indonesia more than a decade ago, working with colleagues from the Indonesian Geological Agency. The goal was to try and crack the secrets of an expanse of ocean known as the \"coral triangle\" – and, they hoped, to use those secrets to protect reefs today. \n\"Understanding how corals have responded to previous environmental changes can help us see how they might respond to future changes,\" says Johnson. In fact, the fossils not only led to a completely new perspective on marine life, but drew attention to important coral sanctuaries that had previously been overlooked – and which could become crucial refuges for species as the planet warms, the researchers say.\nSometimes called the Amazon of the Seas, the coral triangle is as species-rich and teeming with life as a lush rainforest. It spans Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands. About 75% of all known coral species live there – amounting to more than 700 different species – as well as 3,000 species of reef fish and six of the world's seven marine turtle species.\n\"The coral triangle in South East Asia is the most diverse place on Earth,\" in terms of marine habitats, says Johnson. \"There are more marine species there than anywhere else. My colleagues and I wondered: why? What caused the diversity?\" \nIndividual corals, known as polyps, are spineless little marine animals measuring only a few millimetres, and are related to jellyfish and sea anemones. They build hard external skeletons, and together with tens of thousands of other polyps, form the dazzling structures we know as coral reefs. The skeleton remains after the polyp dies.\nThe fossils lined up in the cabinet are in a surprisingly pristine state, with each delicate swirl and dent still intact. In the coral triangle and other reefs, these complex structures support an abundance of life, says Santodomingo.\n\"[Corals] are like small buildings,\" she says. \"One isolated building wouldn't do anything, but when they all grow together, like big cities, they can host a lot of other animals. Baby fish can hide there, so large predators can't reach them.\" When corals die, they leave their skeletons behind, like empty houses, she explains. \"And then other animals can colonise the reef – sponges, or snails, or clams – who use these empty 'buildings' and transform it into their own home.\" \nJohnson adds: \"The metaphor we always use [for coral reefs] is 'cities of the sea'.\"\nIn the early 2010s, the team and their Indonesian colleagues collected about eight tonnes of fossil-rich rock from Indonesian Borneo, which yielded 70,000 coral specimens – over 200 coral species, from up to 30 million years ago. When they compared them to the species living in the coral triangle today, they made a surprising discovery: many of them are still there.\nSantodomingo carefully lifts a huge fossilised coral out of the cabinet, a Porites coral, and holds it up: \"This one here is about 10 million years old.\" Today, Porites corals, which build enormous reefs, are still thriving in the coral triangle, she says.\nShe gives another example, the antler-like staghorn coral, called Acropora monticulosa, which is among the collected fossils from Indonesia. Acropora corals still live in the coral triangle today. These staghorn corals \"have been there for 18 million years or so\", she says. Other acropora species found in the coral triangle are even older.\nThis extraordinary resilience can help explain why there are so many species in the coral triangle today, says Johnson. \"The reason it's the most diverse place on Earth is that once [a coral] gets there, it doesn't go extinct,\" he says. This is very different from how corals fared elsewhere, including in places like the Caribbean that we might think of as vibrant coral habitats, says Johnson. \"In other parts of the world where there are coral reefs, like the Caribbean, there were extinction events in the past,\" he says, caused by dramatic changes in the environment and climate. \"So, two million years ago, half of the coral species in the Caribbean went extinct. And so it's much lower diversity there.\"\nIn some places, corals were wiped out altogether: \"The Mediterranean used to have lots of corals,\" he continues. \"But the Mediterranean dried up, and corals went extinct.\"\nIn South East Asia, the researchers say, the fossil record suggests there wasn't such an extinction event. But, it appears, the corals also had another advantage, one that might even help us protect marine habitats today: they lived in murky water.\nWhen we think of an ideal coral habitat, the picture that comes to mind is usually \"clear water, palm tree on the beach\", Johnson says – a perfect holiday snapshot of those famous reefs in sparkling colours.\nBut as he and Santodomingo point out, that's partly just a reflection of where we've traditionally looked for corals: in clear waters, where it's easy to see them. The fossils from Indonesia, however, told a different story. Research suggests that they lived in cloudy, turbid water, amid swirling sediment and rainwater wash-off.\n\"We think there were these murky environments that helped corals survive,\" says Santodomingo, perhaps because the relatively dark, challenging environment encouraged an especially tough and resilient pool of species to form, all with different traits that allowed them to cope over millions of years.\nWith global warming devastating coral reefs around the world, this insight from the fossils led to another question: if murky water had helped corals in the past, could it still do so today, in an era of global warming and decimated reefs? Specifically, could the muddiness protect reefs from the dramatic phenomenon known as coral bleaching – when entire reefs turn a ghostly white as a result of heat stress? \nBleaching happens when there is a breakdown in a crucial relationship. Corals house tiny colourful algae, a mutually beneficial relationship that has been around since long before dinosaurs became extinct – and which makes the reefs so famously rainbow-like.\n\"Corals are basically farmers, but their crops live inside their bodies,\" says Johnson. \"So the coral gets food from the plants living inside of it, and it fertilises the plants with its animal waste. It's a circle between the plant and the animal.\"\nWhen seawater warms to a level that stresses the corals, for example during a marine heatwave, the coral expels the colourful plant, and turns white. \"It becomes like a toxic relationship,\" says Santodomingo, in which the coral decides it's better to weather the crisis on its own. Scientists are still figuring out why exactly this usually beneficial relationship breaks down under stress – one reason may be that the algae starts to behave more like a parasite than an ally, taking up more energy and nutrients for their own growth. Another explanation is that under higher temperatures, the plant produces substances that are harmful to the coral. Reefs can recover from bleaching – essentially, the stressful event passes, and the plant moves back in – but if the stress is too severe or goes on for too long, the corals will die.\nMurky water may buffer that impact, and make corals more resistant to bleaching, research suggests. In 2020, scientists from the University of Malaysia Sabah investigated how reefs in murky and clear water in the coral triangle responded to a heatwave. They surveyed two habitats in Malaysia: the turbid reef of Sakar and the clear-water reef of Blue Lagoon. In the turbid reefs, less than 10% of colonies bleached. In the clear-water reef, an average of 37% of coral colonies bleached. The result supports \"the hypothesis of turbid reefs hosting resilient coral communities in the face of climate change\", the study's authors concluded.\nOne possible explanation for this protective effect is that bleaching may be caused not only by the warming sea water, but also, by intense sunlight, says Johnson. \"When the water is turbid, there's less light,\" he says, and this could protect the corals.\nA study of a 2016 marine heatwave that caused widespread bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef also found that corals in turbid water, near the shore, were more resistant to bleaching than those in clear water. The authors argued that this showed \"the importance of these resilient but often overlooked coral reef habitats as potential refugia during climate-related disturbances\".\nSeparately, a 2020 analysis of data on bleaching, temperature and turbidity from more than 3,600 coral sites worldwide found that turbidity reduced coral bleaching during heat stress. \"We suggest that these turbid nearshore environments may provide some refuge through climate change, but these reefs will need high conservation status to sustain them close to dense human populations,\" the authors warned. Since murky waters tend to be close to the shore, where rain washes soil into the sea, they are more affected by human pollution, such as plastic waste from single-use plastics like dumped plastic bottles.\nThe findings have encouraged efforts to protect turbid reefs in the coral triangle, Santodomingo and Johnson say, with a plan underway to expand a marine protected area in Malaysia, for example. As clear-water reefs continue to suffer, these turbid reefs could provide a refuge for coral species, the researchers say.\nAs Johnson gently shuts the fossil cabinet of wonders, he turns towards other cabinets, filled with corals collected by previous generations of researchers and explorers, as far back as the 19th Century. Some of these old collections are now being analysed using modern scientific methods, to learn more about reefs and their history, such as CT scans to examine the fossils' insides without cutting them open. One day, future researchers may do the same with the recent fossil collection, he says – using methods we can barely fathom today.\n\"That's why museum collections are important,\" he says. \"We can't imagine what will be possible [in the future].

Could their discoveries help us save our oceans?\nIn an office wing of the Natural History Museum in London, two researchers slide open a plain storage cupboard door to reveal a hidden treasure: shelves of fossilised corals, up to 30 million years old, from the world's most diverse marine habitat. Some look like petrified brains, others like rocks with filigrane patterns.\n\"I like to look at things in the past and see if we can learn lessons from them,\" says Ken Johnson, with an eye on the fossils. Johnson is a palaeontologist and principal researcher at the museum's Earth Sciences department. Next to him stands Nadia Santodomingo, a marine biologist and geoscientist, and curator at the museum. They and their team collected the fossils in Indonesia more than a decade ago, working with colleagues from the Indonesian Geological Agency. The goal was to try and crack the secrets of an expanse of ocean known as the \"coral triangle\" – and, they hoped, to use those secrets to protect reefs today. \n\"Understanding how corals have responded to previous environmental changes can help us see how they might respond to future changes,\" says Johnson. In fact, the fossils not only led to a completely new perspective on marine life, but drew attention to important coral sanctuaries that had previously been overlooked – and which could become crucial refuges for species as the planet warms, the researchers say.\nSometimes called the Amazon of the Seas, the coral triangle is as species-rich and teeming with life as a lush rainforest. It spans Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands. About 75% of all known coral species live there – amounting to more than 700 different species – as well as 3,000 species of reef fish and six of the world's seven marine turtle species.\n\"The coral triangle in South East Asia is the most diverse place on Earth,\" in terms of marine habitats, says Johnson. \"There are more marine species there than anywhere else. My colleagues and I wondered: why? What caused the diversity?\" \nIndividual corals, known as polyps, are spineless little marine animals measuring only a few millimetres, and are related to jellyfish and sea anemones. They build hard external skeletons, and together with tens of thousands of other polyps, form the dazzling structures we know as coral reefs. The skeleton remains after the polyp dies.\nThe fossils lined up in the cabinet are in a surprisingly pristine state, with each delicate swirl and dent still intact. In the coral triangle and other reefs, these complex structures support an abundance of life, says Santodomingo.\n\"[Corals] are like small buildings,\" she says. \"One isolated building wouldn't do anything, but when they all grow together, like big cities, they can host a lot of other animals. Baby fish can hide there, so large predators can't reach them.\" When corals die, they leave their skeletons behind, like empty houses, she explains. \"And then other animals can colonise the reef – sponges, or snails, or clams – who use these empty 'buildings' and transform it into their own home.\" \nJohnson adds: \"The metaphor we always use [for coral reefs] is 'cities of the sea'.\"\nIn the early 2010s, the team and their Indonesian colleagues collected about eight tonnes of fossil-rich rock from Indonesian Borneo, which yielded 70,000 coral specimens – over 200 coral species, from up to 30 million years ago. When they compared them to the species living in the coral triangle today, they made a surprising discovery: many of them are still there.\nSantodomingo carefully lifts a huge fossilised coral out of the cabinet, a Porites coral, and holds it up: \"This one here is about 10 million years old.\" Today, Porites corals, which build enormous reefs, are still thriving in the coral triangle, she says.\nShe gives another example, the antler-like staghorn coral, called Acropora monticulosa, which is among the collected fossils from Indonesia. Acropora corals still live in the coral triangle today. These staghorn corals \"have been there for 18 million years or so\", she says. Other acropora species found in the coral triangle are even older.\nThis extraordinary resilience can help explain why there are so many species in the coral triangle today, says Johnson. \"The reason it's the most diverse place on Earth is that once [a coral] gets there, it doesn't go extinct,\" he says. This is very different from how corals fared elsewhere, including in places like the Caribbean that we might think of as vibrant coral habitats, says Johnson. \"In other parts of the world where there are coral reefs, like the Caribbean, there were extinction events in the past,\" he says, caused by dramatic changes in the environment and climate. \"So, two million years ago, half of the coral species in the Caribbean went extinct.

When they break, it could spell disaster for a whole country's internet. How do you fix a fault at the bottom of the ocean?\nIt was a little after 17:00 on 18 November 1929 when the ground began to shake. Just off the coast of Burin Peninsula, a finger-like protrusion on the south of Newfoundland, Canada, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake disturbed the evening's peace. Residents noticed only a little damage at first – a few toppled chimney pots.\nBut out at sea, an unseen force was moving. By around 19:30, a 13m-high (43ft) tsunami made landfall on the Burin Peninsula. In total, 28 people lost their lives as a result of drowning or injuries caused by the wave.\nThe earthquake was devastating for the local communities, but it also had a long-lasting effect further out at sea. It had triggered a submarine landslide. People did not realise this at the time, historical records suggest, because no one knew such underwater landslides existed. When sediment is disturbed by earthquakes and other geological activity it makes the water denser, causing it to flow downwards like an avalanche of snow down a mountain. The submarine landslide – called a turbidity current – flowed more than 1,000km (621 miles) away from the earthquake's epicentre on the Laurentian Continental Slope at speeds between 50 and 70 knots (57-80mph).\nAlthough the landslide was not noticed at the time, it left a tell-tale clue. In its way lay the latest in communication technology at the time: transatlantic subsea cables. And those cables broke. Twelve of them were snapped in a total of 28 places. Some of the 28 breaks happened almost synchronously with the earthquake. But the other 16 breaks happened over a much longer period, as the cables snapped one after the other in a kind of mysterious ripple pattern, from 59 minutes after the earthquake to 13 hours and 17 minutes later, and over 500km (311 miles) away from the epicentre. (Read more about the undersea rivers that threaten the world's internet.)\nIf they'd all been snapped by the quake itself, the cables would have all broken at the same time – so scientists began to wonder, why didn't they? Why did they break one after the other? \nIt wasn't until 1952 that researchers pieced together why the cables broke in sequence, over such a large area, and at intervals that seemed to slow with distance from the epicentre. They figured out that a landslide smashed through them – the snapping cables traced its movement across the seafloor. Until that point, no one knew of the existence of turbidity currents. Because these cables broke, and because there was a record of the time they broke, they helped in the understanding of ocean movements above and below the surface. They caused a complex repair job, but also became accidental scientific instruments, recording a fascinating natural phenomenon far out of human sight.\nOver the following decades, as the global web of deep-sea cables expanded, their repair and maintenance resulted in other surprising scientific discoveries – opening up entirely new worlds and allowing us to spy on the seabed like never before, while also allowing us to communicate at record speed. At the same time, our daily lives, incomes, health and safety have also become more and more dependent on the internet – and ultimately, this complex network of undersea cables. So what happens when they break?\nThere are 1.4 million km (870,000 miles) of telecommunication cables on the seafloor, covering every ocean on the planet. Laid end to end, these cables would span the diameter of the Sun, and are responsible for the transfer of 99% of all digital data. But for something so important, they are surprisingly slender – often little more than 2cm in diameter, or about the width of a hosepipe.\nA repeat of the 1929 mass cable outage would have significant impacts on communication between North America and Europe. However, \"for the most part, the global network is remarkably resilient,\" says Mike Clare, the International Cable Protection Committee's marine environmental advisor who researches the impacts of extreme events on submarine systems. \"There are 150 to 200 instances of damage to the global network each year. So if we look at that against 1.4 million km, that's not very many, and for the most part, when this damage happens, it can be repaired relatively quickly.\"\nHow does the internet run on such slim cables and avoid disastrous outages?\nSince the first cables were laid in the 19th Century, they have been exposed to extreme environmental events, from submarine volcanic eruption to typhoons and floods. But the biggest cause of damage is not natural.\nMost faults, with figures varying 70-80% depending on where you are in the world, relate to accidental human activities like the dropping of anchors or dragging of trawler boat nets, which snag on the cables, says Stephen Holden, head of maintenance for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Global Marine, a subsea engineering firm who respond to subsea cable repairs. These usually occur in depths of 200-300m (but commercial fishing is increasingly pushing into deeper waters – in some places, 1,500m in the Northeast Atlantic). Only 10-20% of faults worldwide relate to natural hazards, and more frequently relate to cables wearing thin in places where currents cause them to rub against rocks, causing what are called \"shunt faults\", says Holden.\n(The idea that cables break because sharks bite through them is now a bit of an urban legend, adds Clare. \"There were instances of sharks damaging cables, but that's long gone because the cable industry uses a layer of Kevlar to strengthen them.\")\nCables have to be kept thin and light in deeper waters, though, to aid with recovery and repair. Hauling a large, heavy cable up from thousands of metres below sea level would put a huge amount of strain on it. It's the cables nearer the shoreline that tend to be better armoured because they are more likely to be snagged by nets and anchors.\nIf a fault is found, a repair ship is dispatched. \"All these vessels are strategically placed around the world to be 10-12 days from base to port,\" says Mick McGovern, deputy vice-president for marine operations at Alcatel Submarine Networks. \"You have that time to work out where the fault is, load the cables [and the] repeater bodies\" – which increase the strength of a signal as it travels along the cables. \"In essence when you think how big the system is, it's not long to wait,\" he says.\nWhile it took nine months to repair the last of the subsea cable damage caused by the 1929 Newfoundland earthquake, McGovern says a modern deep-water repair should take a week or two depending on the location and the weather. \"When you think about the water depth and where it is, that's not a bad solution.\"\nThat does not mean an entire country's internet is then down for a week. Many nations have more cables and more bandwidth within those cables than the minimum required amount, so that if some are damaged, the others can pick up the slack. This is called redundancy in the system. Because of this redundancy, most of us would never notice if one subsea cable was damaged – perhaps this article would take a second or two longer to load than normal. In extreme events, it can be the only thing keeping a country online. The 2006 magnitude 7 earthquake off the coast of Taiwan, severed dozens of cables in the South China Sea – but a handful remained online.\nTo repair the damage, the ship deploys a grapnel, or grappling hook, to lift and snip the cable, pulling one loose end up to the surface and reeling it in across the bow with large, motorised drums. The damaged section is then winched into an internal room and analysed for a fault, repaired, tested by sending a signal back to land from the boat, sealed and then attached to a buoy while the process is repeated on the other end of the cable.\nOnce both ends are fixed, each optical fibre is spliced together under microscope to make sure that there is good connection, and then they are sealed together with a universal joint that is compatible with any manufacturer's cable, making life easier for international repair teams, McGovern says.\nThe repaired cables are lowered back into the water, and in shallower waters where there might be more boat traffic, they are buried in trenches. Remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs), equipped with high-powered jets, can blast tracks into the seabed for cables to be laid into. In deeper waters, the job is done by ploughs which are equipped with jets and dragged along the seabed by large repair vessels above. Some ploughs weigh more than 50 tonnes, and in extreme environments, bigger equipment is needed – such as one job McGovern recalls in the Arctic Ocean which required a ship dragging a 110-tonne plough, capable of burying cables 4m and penetrating the permafrost. \nLaying and repairing the cables has led to some surprising scientific insights – at first somewhat accidentally, as in the case of the snapped cables and the landslide, and later, by design, as scientists began to intentionally use the cables as research tools.\nThese lessons from the deep sea began as the first transatlantic cables were laid in the 19th Century. Cable layers noticed that the Atlantic Ocean gets shallower in the middle, inadvertently discovering the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.\nToday, telecommunication cables can be used as \"acoustic sensors\" to detect whales, ships, storms and earthquakes in the high seas.\nThe damage caused to cables offers the industry \"fundamental new understandings about hazards that exist in the deep sea,\" says Clare. \"We'd never have known that there were landslides under the sea after volcanic eruptions if it wasn't from the damage that was created.\"\nIn some places, climate change is making matters more challenging. Floods in West Africa are causing an increase in canyon-flushing in the Congo River, which is when large volumes of sediment flows into a river after flooding. This sediment is then dumped out of the river mouth into the Atlantic and could damage cables. \"We know now to lay the cable further away from the estuary,\" says McGovern.\nSome damage will be unavoidable, the experts predict. The Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption in 2021-2022 destroyed the subsea internet cable linking the Pacific Island nation of Tonga to the rest of the world. It took five weeks until its internet connection was fully functioning again, though some make-shift services were restored after a week. While this huge eruption (casting a plume of ash 36 miles (58km) into the air) was an unusually large event, connecting an island nation in a volcanically active area will always carry some risk, says Holden.\nHowever, many countries are served by multiple subsea cables, meaning one fault, or even multiple faults, might not be noticed by internet users, as the network can fall back on other cables in a crisis.\n\"This really points to why there's a need for geographic diversity of cable routes,\" adds Clare. \"Particularly for small islands in places like the South Pacific that have tropical storms and earthquakes and volcanoes, they are particularly vulnerable, and with climate change, different areas are being affected in different ways.\" \nAs fishing and shipping get more sophisticated, avoiding cables might be made easier. The advent of automatic identification system (AIS) on shipping has led to a reduction in anchoring damage, says Holden, because some firms now offer a service where you can follow a set pattern for slowing down and anchoring. But in areas of the world where fishing vessels tend to be less sophisticated and operated by smaller crews, anchor damage still happens.\nIn those places, an option is to tell people where cables are, and to increase awareness, adds Clare: \"It's for everyone's benefit that the internet keeps running.\"\n-- \nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X."]}
{"id": 48, "question": "How long did it take to repair the subsea cable damage caused by the 1929 Newfoundland earthquake?", "answer": ["Nine months"], "doc": ["While it took nine months to repair the last of the subsea cable damage caused by the 1929 Newfoundland earthquake, McGovern says a modern deep-water repair should take a week or two depending on the location and the weather. \"When you think about the water depth and where it is, that's not a bad solution.", "Scientists first figured this out in 1929 when an earthquake caused a massive slump offshore Newfoundland, breaking subsea telecommunications cables progressively as the turbidity current rolled into deeper and deeper water. Since then, civilization has grown to depend almost entirely on subsea cables for global communication.", "The majority of the monetary damage was due to repair costs of the damaged transatlantic cables. Unaware of the danger coming from the sea, the communities of Burin Peninsula, Newfoundland, suffered heavy damages and loss of 29 people. The tsunami was registered as far as South Carolina and Portugal.", "On November 18, 1929, at 017:02 Newfoundland time, an earthquake occurred of the coast of Grand Banks, Newfoundland. A tsunami was triggered by a sub-marine landslide and the earthquake, which had a Richter magnitude of 7.2 with an epicenter of 44.5°N, 56.3°W.", "The 2006 magnitude 7 earthquake off the coast of Taiwan, severed dozens of cables in the South China Sea – but a handful remained online.

When they break, it could spell disaster for a whole country's internet. How do you fix a fault at the bottom of the ocean?\nIt was a little after 17:00 on 18 November 1929 when the ground began to shake. Just off the coast of Burin Peninsula, a finger-like protrusion on the south of Newfoundland, Canada, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake disturbed the evening's peace. Residents noticed only a little damage at first – a few toppled chimney pots.\nBut out at sea, an unseen force was moving. By around 19:30, a 13m-high (43ft) tsunami made landfall on the Burin Peninsula. In total, 28 people lost their lives as a result of drowning or injuries caused by the wave.\nThe earthquake was devastating for the local communities, but it also had a long-lasting effect further out at sea. It had triggered a submarine landslide. People did not realise this at the time, historical records suggest, because no one knew such underwater landslides existed. When sediment is disturbed by earthquakes and other geological activity it makes the water denser, causing it to flow downwards like an avalanche of snow down a mountain. The submarine landslide – called a turbidity current – flowed more than 1,000km (621 miles) away from the earthquake's epicentre on the Laurentian Continental Slope at speeds between 50 and 70 knots (57-80mph).\nAlthough the landslide was not noticed at the time, it left a tell-tale clue. In its way lay the latest in communication technology at the time: transatlantic subsea cables. And those cables broke. Twelve of them were snapped in a total of 28 places. Some of the 28 breaks happened almost synchronously with the earthquake. But the other 16 breaks happened over a much longer period, as the cables snapped one after the other in a kind of mysterious ripple pattern, from 59 minutes after the earthquake to 13 hours and 17 minutes later, and over 500km (311 miles) away from the epicentre. (Read more about the undersea rivers that threaten the world's internet.)\nIf they'd all been snapped by the quake itself, the cables would have all broken at the same time – so scientists began to wonder, why didn't they? Why did they break one after the other? \nIt wasn't until 1952 that researchers pieced together why the cables broke in sequence, over such a large area, and at intervals that seemed to slow with distance from the epicentre. They figured out that a landslide smashed through them – the snapping cables traced its movement across the seafloor. Until that point, no one knew of the existence of turbidity currents. Because these cables broke, and because there was a record of the time they broke, they helped in the understanding of ocean movements above and below the surface. They caused a complex repair job, but also became accidental scientific instruments, recording a fascinating natural phenomenon far out of human sight.\nOver the following decades, as the global web of deep-sea cables expanded, their repair and maintenance resulted in other surprising scientific discoveries – opening up entirely new worlds and allowing us to spy on the seabed like never before, while also allowing us to communicate at record speed. At the same time, our daily lives, incomes, health and safety have also become more and more dependent on the internet – and ultimately, this complex network of undersea cables. So what happens when they break?\nThere are 1.4 million km (870,000 miles) of telecommunication cables on the seafloor, covering every ocean on the planet. Laid end to end, these cables would span the diameter of the Sun, and are responsible for the transfer of 99% of all digital data. But for something so important, they are surprisingly slender – often little more than 2cm in diameter, or about the width of a hosepipe.\nA repeat of the 1929 mass cable outage would have significant impacts on communication between North America and Europe. However, \"for the most part, the global network is remarkably resilient,\" says Mike Clare, the International Cable Protection Committee's marine environmental advisor who researches the impacts of extreme events on submarine systems. \"There are 150 to 200 instances of damage to the global network each year.

But many alien worlds capable of supporting life may not have such clear delineations.\nDo aliens sleep? You may take sleep for granted, but research suggests many planets that could evolve life don't have a day-night cycle. It's hard to imagine, but there are organisms living in Earth's lightless habitats, deep underground or at the bottom of the sea, that give us an idea what alien life without a circadian rhythm may be like. \nThere are billions of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy. How do we arrive at this number? The Milky Way has between 100 billion and 400 billion stars.\nSeventy percent of these are tiny, cool red dwarfs, also known as M-dwarfs. A detailed exoplanet survey published in 2013 estimated that 41% of M-dwarf stars have a planet orbiting in their \"Goldilocks\" zone, the distance at which the planet has the right temperature to support liquid water.\nThese planets only have the potential to host liquid water, though. We don't yet know if any of them actually do have water, much less life. Still, that comes to 28.7 billion planets in the Goldilocks zones of M-dwarfs alone. This is not even considering other types of stars like our own yellow Sun. \nRocky planets orbiting in an M-dwarf's habitable zone are called M-Earths. M-Earths differ from our Earth in fundamental ways. For one thing, because M-dwarf stars are much cooler than the Sun, they are close-in, which makes the gravitational pull of the star on the planet immensely strong.\nThe star's gravity pulls harder on the near side of the planet than the far side, creating friction that resists and slows the planet's spin over aeons until spin and orbit are synchronised. This means most M-Earths are probably tidally locked, which is when one hemisphere always faces the sun while the other always faces away.\nA tidally locked planet's year is the same length as its day. The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth, which is why we always see only one face of the Moon and never its far side.\nA tidally locked planet may seem exotic, but most potentially habitable planets are probably like this. Our closest planetary neighbour, Proxima Centauri b (located in the Alpha Centauri system four light-years away), is probably a tidally locked M-Earth.\nUnlike our Earth, then, M-Earths have no days, no nights and no seasons. But life on Earth, from bacteria to humans, has circadian rhythms tuned to the day-night cycle.\nSleep is only the most obvious of these. The circadian cycle affects biochemistry, body temperature, cell regeneration, behaviour and much more. For example, people who receive vaccinations in the morning develop more antibodies than those who receive them in the afternoon because the immune system's responsiveness varies throughout the day.\nWe don't know for sure how important periods of inactivity and regeneration are to life. Maybe beings that evolved without cyclical time can just keep on chugging, never needing to rest.\nTo inform our speculation, we can look at organisms on Earth that thrive far from daylight, such as cave-dwellers, deep-sea life and microorganisms in dark environments like the Earth's crust and the human body.\nMany of these life-forms do have biorhythms, synchronised to stimuli other than light. Naked mole rats spend their entire lives underground, never seeing the Sun, but they have circadian clocks attuned to daily and seasonal cycles of temperature and rainfall. Deep-sea mussels and hot vent shrimp synchronise with the ocean tides.\nBacteria living in the human gut synchronise with melatonin fluctuations in their host. Melatonin is a hormone your body produces in response to darkness.\nTemperature variations caused by thermal vents, humidity fluctuations and changes in environmental chemistry or currents can all trigger bio-oscillations in organisms. This hints that biorhythms have intrinsic benefits.\nRecent research shows M-Earths could have cycles that replace days and seasons. To study questions like these, scientists have adapted climate models to simulate what the environment on an M-Earth would look like, including our neighbour Proxima Centauri b.\nIn these simulations, the contrast between an M-Earth's dayside and nightside seems to generate rapid jets of wind and atmospheric waves like those that cause Earth's jet stream to bend and meander. If the planet has water, the dayside probably forms thick clouds full of lightning.\nInteractions between winds, atmospheric waves and clouds may shift the climate between different states, causing regular cycles in temperature, humidity and rainfall. The lengths of these cycles will vary by planet from tens to hundreds of Earth days, but they won't be related to its rotation period. While the star remains fixed in the sky of these planets, the environment will be changing.\nMore like this:• Where we might find alien life in the next decade• What alien languages might sound like• Why aliens might be weirder than we think\nPerhaps life on M-Earths would evolve biorhythms synchronised to these cycles. If a circadian clock organises internal biochemical oscillations, it may have to.\nOr perhaps evolution would find a weirder solution. We could imagine species that live on the planet's dayside and migrate to the nightside to rest and regenerate. A circadian clock in space instead of in time.\nThis thought should remind us that, if life exists out there, it will upend assumptions we didn't know we had. The only certainty is that it will surprise us.\nMaureen Cohen is a postdoctoral research associate in Venus global climate modelling at The Open University.\n-- \nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X."]}

But what does “similar” mean? Many rocky planets have been detected in Earth’s size-range: a point in favor of possible life.", "Distinct days and nights have helped life flourish on Earth. But many alien worlds capable of supporting life may not have such clear delineations.\nDo aliens sleep? You may take sleep for granted, but research suggests many planets that could evolve life don't have a day-night cycle. It's hard to imagine, but there are organisms living in Earth's lightless habitats, deep underground or at the bottom of the sea, that give us an idea what alien life without a circadian rhythm may be like. \nThere are billions of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy. How do we arrive at this number? The Milky Way has between 100 billion and 400 billion stars.\nSeventy percent of these are tiny, cool red dwarfs, also known as M-dwarfs. A detailed exoplanet survey published in 2013 estimated that 41% of M-dwarf stars have a planet orbiting in their \"Goldilocks\" zone, the distance at which the planet has the right temperature to support liquid water.\nThese planets only have the potential to host liquid water, though. We don't yet know if any of them actually do have water, much less life. Still, that comes to 28.7 billion planets in the Goldilocks zones of M-dwarfs alone. This is not even considering other types of stars like our own yellow Sun. \nRocky planets orbiting in an M-dwarf's habitable zone are called M-Earths. M-Earths differ from our Earth in fundamental ways. For one thing, because M-dwarf stars are much cooler than the Sun, they are close-in, which makes the gravitational pull of the star on the planet immensely strong.\nThe star's gravity pulls harder on the near side of the planet than the far side, creating friction that resists and slows the planet's spin over aeons until spin and orbit are synchronised. This means most M-Earths are probably tidally locked, which is when one hemisphere always faces the sun while the other always faces away.\nA tidally locked planet's year is the same length as its day. The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth, which is why we always see only one face of the Moon and never its far side.\nA tidally locked planet may seem exotic, but most potentially habitable planets are probably like this. Our closest planetary neighbour, Proxima Centauri b (located in the Alpha Centauri system four light-years away), is probably a tidally locked M-Earth.\nUnlike our Earth, then, M-Earths have no days, no nights and no seasons. But life on Earth, from bacteria to humans, has circadian rhythms tuned to the day-night cycle.\nSleep is only the most obvious of these. The circadian cycle affects biochemistry, body temperature, cell regeneration, behaviour and much more. For example, people who receive vaccinations in the morning develop more antibodies than those who receive them in the afternoon because the immune system's responsiveness varies throughout the day.\nWe don't know for sure how important periods of inactivity and regeneration are to life. Maybe beings that evolved without cyclical time can just keep on chugging, never needing to rest.\nTo inform our speculation, we can look at organisms on Earth that thrive far from daylight, such as cave-dwellers, deep-sea life and microorganisms in dark environments like the Earth's crust and the human body.\nMany of these life-forms do have biorhythms, synchronised to stimuli other than light. Naked mole rats spend their entire lives underground, never seeing the Sun, but they have circadian clocks attuned to daily and seasonal cycles of temperature and rainfall. Deep-sea mussels and hot vent shrimp synchronise with the ocean tides.\nBacteria living in the human gut synchronise with melatonin fluctuations in their host. Melatonin is a hormone your body produces in response to darkness.\nTemperature variations caused by thermal vents, humidity fluctuations and changes in environmental chemistry or currents can all trigger bio-oscillations in organisms. This hints that biorhythms have intrinsic benefits.\nRecent research shows M-Earths could have cycles that replace days and seasons.

{"id": 52, "question": "What percentage of caloric intake is attributed to ultra-processed foods in the UK?", "answer": ["57%"], "doc": ["13 To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between consumption of ultra-processed foods, as defined per NOVA,6 and dietary content of free sugar in different age groups of the UK population.", "Almost half of excessive intake of free sugars in the UK can be attributed to ultra-processed foods. Policies to reduce sugar consumption should focus on minimising consumption of ultra-processed foods and replacing them with unprocessed or minimally processed food alternatives.", "In Canada it is estimated that UPF contribute approximately 55% of the total caloric intake in children and adolescents (2–18y) versus 45% in adults [14]. In the USA, children (6-11y) (69.0%) and adolescents (12–19y) (67.7%) consumed a significantly higher percentage of energy from UPF than those aged 2–5 years (61.1%) [15].", "The highest intake is in the United States (58% of daily energy intake) and the lowest in Colombia (16%).916 Intake also varies within Europe, ranging from 15% of total calories consumed by the adult population in Romania to 57% in the UK.", "8% of total energy intake and 64.7% of total free sugars in the UK diet. Free sugars represent 12.4% of total energy intake, and 61.3% of the sample exceeded the recommended limit of 10% energy from free sugars. This percentage was higher among children (74.9%) and adolescents (82.9%).", "Vegan diets can contain more UPFs on average – but this might not be a problem.\nFor most people living in industrialised societies, it's difficult to avoid ultra-processed foods altogether. My cereal is ultra-processed. So is the whiskey in my cabinet, the hot sauce in my fridge and the crisps in my backpack. \nThe term \"ultra-processed\" is poorly understood and inconsistently used, even sometimes by scientists. While in some circles it has become a catch-all term for foods with little nutritional benefit, a wide variety of foods fall under this umbrella.\nUltra-processed foods are popular with consumers for their convenience (frozen pizza), taste (wrapped cookies), and durability (sandwich bread). These elements, plus the relatively low cost of ingredients, make them profitable for manufacturers.\nBut recently another motivation for ultra-processed foods has emerged: to replace meat or dairy among those attempting to eat a more plant-based diet. With this new category has come anxiety about the health effects of these products, leading to headlines such as \"The unhealthiest fake meats you can buy (and why it's better to go to McDonald's)\". These concerns were exacerbated by recent research, which found that those who consume 10% more ultra-processed foods derived from plants have a 12% higher risk of death related to diet. However, things are not quite as they seem. Are plant-based diets really so rich in ultra-processed foods, and are they any worse for you?\nAn established method for categorising the levels of processing in food is Nova. Fernanda Rauber, a nutritional epidemiologist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, explains, \"Nova distinguishes between different levels of processing, acknowledging that not all processed foods are harmful. In fact, many types of processing, such as pasteurisation or fermentation, are important for food safety and nutrition.\" It's the more intense processing that concerns Rauber. \"One type of industrial processing is harmful to health – the kind that produces ultra-processed foods.\" \nIn the Nova system, a food product is considered ultra-processed if at least one of its ingredients is a substance that home cooks generally don't use (such as high-fructose corn syrup or hydrolysed protein), or is an additive designed to increase the product's appeal (such as a thickener or emulsifier).\nSome experts have criticised the four-category Nova system as simplistic and imprecise, arguing that foods aren't automatically unhealthy simply because they're ultra-processed. For instance, ultra-processed cereals and breads can have beneficial fibre, although diets high in UPFs tend to be limited in fibre and other nutrients in general.\nNor are foods good for you just because they're less processed. Red meat has been linked with higher mortality from cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease and stroke, yet is classified as unprocessed or minimally processed by Nova.\nIn practice many UPFs are also high in salt, sugar or fat. The food industry uses a great deal of sugar not only to sweeten foods, but also to enhance their texture, colour, preservation, or even bulk.\nNotwithstanding the occasional exception, overall, the health effects of ultra-processed foods are negative. A 2023 UK study found that a 10% increase in UPFs within diets was associated with a 2% higher rate of cancer overall, and a 19% higher rate of ovarian cancer.\nThis is partly linked to obesity. It's easy to overeat ultra-processed foods, which tend to be less filling, and possibly even addictive, often while requiring less chewing. Unsurprisingly, then, they're linked with higher calorie consumption and weight gain. The proportion of the diet made up by ultra-processed foods varies widely across the globe; UPFs make up 16% of mean caloric intake in Colombia, 20% in Taiwan, and 22% in Brazil. On the other hand, they make up 48% in Canada, 57% in the UK and 58% in the US. In some North American groups it can be as high as 80%.\nThere is also emerging evidence that certain food additives and packaging contaminants are carcinogenic, and cause inflammation and other bodily changes.\nAmong plant-based foods, ultra-processed ones are linked to higher risk of cardiovascular disease. A 2024 UK study that garnered much attention found that a 10% increase in caloric intake of plant-sourced ultra-processed food was associated with a 5% higher risk of cardiovascular disease, and a 12% greater risk of dying from this. On the other hand, there was a slightly greater reduction in cardiovascular disease risk from consuming more plant-sourced foods that were not ultra-processed. The ultra-processed foods included a number of foods considered \"vegan by default\", such as bread, crisps and condiments. Meat alternatives were the smallest contributor to calories among the participants overall, at 0.2%.\nThis research didn't assess specific foods like plant-based ones in isolation, stresses Rauber, one of the study's coauthors. \"From an epidemiological perspective, what truly matters is the overall dietary pattern, rather than focusing on individual foods,\" Rauber says. Thus, \"it's not just the origin of the food – whether animal or plant – but the degree of processing that has significant implications for health\".\nA 2021 French study found that ultra-processed foods made up more of the overall calorie intake of non-meat-eaters. UPFs accounted for 37% and 39.5% of energy intake for vegetarians and vegans, respectively, mainly due to meat and dairy substitutes. This was significantly higher than the 33% figure for meat eaters. But while the vegan participants consumed more UPFs, they also consumed more unprocessed foods (accounting for 31.2% of energy intake for vegans and 29% for meat eaters), and fewer fatty and sweet foods.\nStudy participants who had recently made the switch to vegetarian and vegan consumed more UPFs than longtime meat avoiders. In general, it's common for people experimenting with reducing animal products to lean on substitutes and packaged foods initially.\nWhile nutritional research abounds, so does confusion. This is partly due to differences in what is being analysed, such as whether these are meat alternatives or other foods that happen to not contain animal products, such as bread. In other words, are researchers looking at vegan burgers, the buns they're sandwiched between, or the crisps on the side? It depends. \nStudies of multiple European countries have found notable associations between multiple diseases, including type 2 diabetes, and ultra-processed products in general – yet those same studies found lesser risk for plant-based alternatives compared to animal-based products. And a 2024 US study concluded that the strongest links between mortality and ultra-processed foods showed up in ready-to-eat products based around meat, poultry or seafood.\nLewis Bollard, who directs the farm animal welfare programme at the foundation Open Philanthropy, says that in the plant-based space, criticisms have tended to focus on alternative proteins. According to Bollard, critics include meat-industry companies concerned about their profit model, as well as people following whole-food plant-based diets themselves.\n\"It's important to look at what's actually in the ultra-processed foods,\" notes Paul Behrens, a food systems expert at the University of Oxford. \"Of course, we should aim for delicious, whole-food, plant-based meals as the core of our diet, but ultra-processed plant-based foods generally have much better nutrition scores than ultra-processed meat foods,” he says. \"One study found that, on average, vegan sausages had a nutrition impact score over twice as good as pork sausages.\"\nSo one key question is what is being replaced. A bean stew might be more nourishing than a pea protein sausage. But a pea protein sausage is likely more nourishing than a mixed-meat sausage – not to mention the differences in environmental and animal-welfare impacts.\nA 2024 review comparing animal and plant-based meat found that the meat alternatives were lower overall in saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, cholesterol and calories, while being higher in fibre, carbohydrate and polyunsaturated fat. Not all fats are created equal. Polyunsaturated fat, found at higher levels in meat alternatives, has an important place in diets. And a 2018 study of US healthcare professionals found lower heart disease risk among people who ate more plant-based monounsaturated fat (such as vegetable oils), though not animal-based monounsaturated fat (such as red meat). \nHowever, Rauber cautions, \"While saturated fats are often linked to animal-based foods, it's important to note that many ultra-processed plant-based products can also be high in saturated fats due to the use of modified oils and fats during processing\".\nMeat alternatives have captured so much public discussion for several reasons, says Tamsin Blaxter, a writer and researcher at Table, a network of universities researching food systems. One is their novelty factor. Another is the preoccupation in certain affluent countries with protein, and thus with alternatives to it. Throughout history, there have been waves of thinking, without necessarily being grounded in evidence, that a diet high in animal protein is more natural for humans, and that natural is better. Bollard also points out that it's common for people in industrialised societies to have misconceptions about how animal protein is actually produced and how \"natural\" it is. \nConcerns over ultra-processed foods are affecting public health policy. For instance, Nova has influenced dietary guidelines in Brazil, whose government is also considering imposing taxes on ultra-processed foods and regulating them more strictly in schools. Carlos Monteiro, the University of São Paulo epidemiologist who coined the term \"ultra-processed\" in 2009, now believes that ultra-processed foods should be regulated similarly to tobacco, with advertising restrictions and heavy taxation.\nYet Eileen Gibney, a nutrition professor at University College Dublin, has argued that the world will need to embrace food processing in the transition toward more plant-based diets, if consumers want plant-based versions of the foods they're already accustomed to.\nCompanies making foods without animal products have to navigate between perceptions that vegan food is too healthy and boring, and conversely that it is overly processed and unhealthy. Anke van Eijk, the R&D manager for Dutch plant-based business Schouten, says that many consumers, especially flexitarians, \"still want a seamless transition to plant-based eating, and highly processed products deliver on that expectation\".\nSome food manufacturers and retailers have responded to consumer concerns by creating products with fewer ingredients and additives, according to van Eijk. \"An example would be the growing interest in whole-food-based products, like plant-based patties made with recognisable ingredients such as beans, vegetables or grains.\" She says that it will not be easy for manufacturers to move beyond standard industrial processes or ingredients, though Schouten has recently developed its own fibre to replace textured proteins.\nYet more broadly, Blaxter believes \"there's a danger here that the reformulation question only leads to quite narrow incremental change\". She points to previous health panics, for instance around fat. While she acknowledges the need for further research to tease out health outcomes related to ultra-processed foods, plant-based or otherwise, she's concerned that over-attention to one aspect of food risks distracting from overall food systems, which ultimately impacts our eating habits and health more.\nAs well, Blaxter worries about the \"weaponisation of disgust using the term 'ultra-processed food'\", which can seep into judgements toward people with different life circumstances. Altogether, she calls ultra-processing \"a really complicated and contested concept\" that is currently intersecting with cultural, political and technological anxieties around control of food and plant-based innovations.\nMany nutrition experts urge people to minimise their consumption of ultra-processed food.\nRauber says that emphasising the nutritional benefits of particular plant-based ultra-processed products has limitations. This perspective \"tends to overlook the fact that these foods are still highly processed, often lack whole food ingredients, and may contain various additives that make them hyper-palatable and can lead to overconsumption.\" \nSarah Berry, a nutrition professor at King's College London, and the chief scientist at the nutrition company ZOE, calls for balance. \"Whether animal-based or plant-based, it's important that consumers know that not all UPFs are created equal,\" Berry says.\nFor her, \"The key takeaway is that you don't need to avoid all UPFs, and it would be very difficult to do so. It's your overall dietary pattern that matters for long-term health. If you regularly consume fruits and vegetables – whether they're tinned, frozen or fresh – nuts, seeds, and legumes, you're on the right path. As long as you have a good overall diet across weeks and months, if some UPFs make it into your shopping trolley, it's not a major concern. However, it's worth trying to consume ultra-processed meat products and fizzy drinks just once in a while.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and X."]}

Some are sitting at their desk at work, while others are mid-air on a transatlantic flight. But all Nobel Prize winners receive a phone call to break the big news to them.\nThen, moments after they hang up, their phone rings again.\nThe man on the other end of the line is Adam Smith.\nSince 2006, he has been one of the first voices that a new Nobel laureate will hear. In his role as chief scientific officer at Nobel Prize Outreach, Smith has spoken to almost every new prize winner just as reality is dawning. His job is to have the first conversation with new Nobel laureates to capture their excitement, reflections and surprise at receiving a prize.\nIt is a moment steeped in shock, elation or, very occasionally, disgruntlement at having been drawn away from an experiment.\nThe person who typically calls up laureates to break the initial news, the committee secretary or the head of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, tends to change every few years or so. But Smith has been in post for 18 years – a continuity which puts him in a somewhat unique position.\n\"I've spoken to more [Nobel laureates] than anybody else has ever done,\" says Smith, looking thoughtful as he considers the point. \"I don't know what it adds up to. I ought to stop and think about that sometimes.\"\nSmith intends these calls to be the start of a working relationship with the laureates, who will often travel to events around the world with Nobel Prize Outreach to speak with young scientists, engineers and students. The calls, which are recorded for the podcast Nobel Prize Conversations, make up one part of an archive of interviews with laureates he and his team have built up over the years.\nIt's not just the number of new Nobel laureates he speaks to that makes Smith's job unusual, but the particular moment he catches them.\n\"In a perfect world, the news is breaking as I'm phoning, and they haven't talked to anybody else. And sometimes that really does happen,\" says Smith. \"It's a very nice point in time to catch somebody, when their guard is down a bit.\"\nBut it doesn't always go to plan. Sometimes, if the committee hasn't been able to get through to a prize winner, Smith's call is the first contact. He's not supposed to break the news to them but his call from Stockholm, where the Nobel Foundation headquarters are, can be bit of a giveaway on the day of the announcement.\nSometimes things go even further off-script. Occasionally, neither the committee secretary nor Smith can reach the prize winner before the public announcement goes ahead. Peter Higgs, who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013 and was a famously private person, had gone out for lunch with no phone on the day of the announcement. He learned the news from a former neighbour, who stopped her car to congratulate him in the street as he was walking home in Edinburgh.\nOn another occasion, in an effort to reach the biologist Linda Buck, who shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2004, the committee rang the director of the research centre where she worked. The director answered the phone at 2am in Seattle and initially gave a grumpy response, believing it was someone hustling for a job in the faculty rather than the Nobel committee.\nMost Nobel Prize winners have some suspicion that they might be in for success before they receive the news. Some might seek to avoid attention, like Higgs, while others have been known to keep a camera by their bed on announcement night each year, in the hopes of capturing the happy moment, says Smith.\n\"It's very unusual to get a Nobel Prize without having some inkling that you might get a Nobel Prize, and yet it really isn't something to wait for – it could really eat you up if you were waiting for it,\" says Smith.\nEmmanuelle Charpentier, who shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, describes being reminded \"thousands of times\" that the prize could well be in her future, after her pioneering work developing the gene-editing tool Crispr-Cas9.\nOne person who knew he was in the running was John Jumper, who shared 2024's Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work developing an AI tool, AlphaFold2, to predict the structures of almost all known proteins. \"If you're going to have developed AlphaFold, you're going to be straightforward about life,\" says Smith. \"So in the interview he said, 'I think I had a 10% chance.'\"\nBut most are more circumspect about their hopes and expectations. \"Even if [a laureate] thought it might happen at some point, there's probably been quite a few years of that going on, and people have had false starts, and some of them have even had hoaxes played on them,\" says Smith.\nDespite the expectation, the build-up, the prank calls, and sometimes year after year of disappointment – the typical reaction is one of great surprise. \"No matter how much they might have been told by people that it might come one day, it's incredibly surprising when it happens,\" says Smith. \"They are genuinely amazed. It takes their breath away, I suppose, in almost all cases.\"\nThat said, you really can't generalise: once or twice, a new laureate has been quite perturbed by Smith's call. Konstantin Novoselov, who shared the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of graphene, and Arthur Ashkin who shared the same prize in 2018 for developing optical tweezers to move tiny objects using lasers, both gave Smith the same disgruntled reaction: \"You mean I have to stop my experiment? I'm kind of busy.\"\nSome, like Louise Glück, who won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature, had very mixed feelings – and were simply desperate for a coffee.\nSometimes, Smith might be expecting a tricky call but is pleasantly surprised.\nWhen Doris Lessing won the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature, she famously received the news after getting out of a taxi laden with bags of shopping. Her reaction to the reporter who broke the news to her was dismissive to say the least, waving him away and saying, \"Oh, Christ,\" before dropping her shopping to the street with a thump.\n\"I spoke to her very shortly afterwards,\" says Smith. \"I knew what had happened, and I thought, 'This is not going to go well.'\"\nBut in fact Smith was \"tremendously happy\" with the call. \"We connected enough that she was happy, and she was enjoying the conversation, and that was one that I was very proud of, because I'd felt that she was going to be impossible.\"\nThe call with Alice Munro, who won the 2013 literature prize, also caused Smith some trepidation beforehand. But the conversation went well, with Smith describing it as \"thrilling\" to find her a good interviewee.\nIn some calls, it's all Smith can do to hang on – one of those was with Roger Penrose, who shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\"He thinks so fast, and he talks fast,\" says Smith. \"It began with the fact that his assistant had just been doing his hair – so we started pretty mundane, and by the end of the conversation we got to the end of the Universe, disappearing into supermassive black holes and re-emerging as the next universe. And you know, that's a long way to travel in conversation.\n\"It did feel like you were holding on to the saddle, and just trying desperately not to fall off.\"\nAfter 18 years of making these calls, Smith says he still feels a little hesitant about disturbing the new laureates as they enjoy the glow of their win, especially if it is the middle of their night. \"All this chasing of people – it's not a very comfortable thing to do. Because, although the person will probably be happy when they get on the phone with you, you know you're intruding.\"\nSmith describes the calls themselves as \"very intense\". \"I can feel elated or depressed, depending on whether it's worked or not.\n\"You know absolutely whether you've connected with somebody, and they're listening to you, or whether it's just been a rather formulaic thing,\" says Smith. \"If I feel that we've connected, it's wonderful. And of course I'm very happy. And if it's been less than satisfactory, of course it's sad. It's a missed opportunity, and it only comes once.\"\nAt the end of a busy week of announcements, Smith reflects on his role in taking a snapshot at a momentous time.\n\"In a way, this call that I make is just to say, 'Hi, how are you? Congratulations, and what's it like?'

Some are sitting at their desk at work, while others are mid-air on a transatlantic flight. But all Nobel Prize winners receive a phone call to break the big news to them.\nThen, moments after they hang up, their phone rings again.\nThe man on the other end of the line is Adam Smith.\nSince 2006, he has been one of the first voices that a new Nobel laureate will hear. In his role as chief scientific officer at Nobel Prize Outreach, Smith has spoken to almost every new prize winner just as reality is dawning. His job is to have the first conversation with new Nobel laureates to capture their excitement, reflections and surprise at receiving a prize.\nIt is a moment steeped in shock, elation or, very occasionally, disgruntlement at having been drawn away from an experiment.\nThe person who typically calls up laureates to break the initial news, the committee secretary or the head of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, tends to change every few years or so. But Smith has been in post for 18 years – a continuity which puts him in a somewhat unique position.\n\"I've spoken to more [Nobel laureates] than anybody else has ever done,\" says Smith, looking thoughtful as he considers the point. \"I don't know what it adds up to. I ought to stop and think about that sometimes.\"\nSmith intends these calls to be the start of a working relationship with the laureates, who will often travel to events around the world with Nobel Prize Outreach to speak with young scientists, engineers and students. The calls, which are recorded for the podcast Nobel Prize Conversations, make up one part of an archive of interviews with laureates he and his team have built up over the years.\nIt's not just the number of new Nobel laureates he speaks to that makes Smith's job unusual, but the particular moment he catches them.\n\"In a perfect world, the news is breaking as I'm phoning, and they haven't talked to anybody else. And sometimes that really does happen,\" says Smith. \"It's a very nice point in time to catch somebody, when their guard is down a bit.\"\nBut it doesn't always go to plan. Sometimes, if the committee hasn't been able to get through to a prize winner, Smith's call is the first contact. He's not supposed to break the news to them but his call from Stockholm, where the Nobel Foundation headquarters are, can be bit of a giveaway on the day of the announcement.\nSometimes things go even further off-script. Occasionally, neither the committee secretary nor Smith can reach the prize winner before the public announcement goes ahead. Peter Higgs, who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013 and was a famously private person, had gone out for lunch with no phone on the day of the announcement. He learned the news from a former neighbour, who stopped her car to congratulate him in the street as he was walking home in Edinburgh.\nOn another occasion, in an effort to reach the biologist Linda Buck, who shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2004, the committee rang the director of the research centre where she worked. The director answered the phone at 2am in Seattle and initially gave a grumpy response, believing it was someone hustling for a job in the faculty rather than the Nobel committee.\nMost Nobel Prize winners have some suspicion that they might be in for success before they receive the news. Some might seek to avoid attention, like Higgs, while others have been known to keep a camera by their bed on announcement night each year, in the hopes of capturing the happy moment, says Smith.\n\"It's very unusual to get a Nobel Prize without having some inkling that you might get a Nobel Prize, and yet it really isn't something to wait for – it could really eat you up if you were waiting for it,\" says Smith.\nEmmanuelle Charpentier, who shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, describes being reminded \"thousands of times\" that the prize could well be in her future, after her pioneering work developing the gene-editing tool Crispr-Cas9.\nOne person who knew he was in the running was John Jumper, who shared 2024's Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work developing an AI tool, AlphaFold2, to predict the structures of almost all known proteins. \"If you're going to have developed AlphaFold, you're going to be straightforward about life,\" says Smith. \"So in the interview he said, 'I think I had a 10% chance.'\"\nBut most are more circumspect about their hopes and expectations. \"Even if [a laureate] thought it might happen at some point, there's probably been quite a few years of that going on, and people have had false starts, and some of them have even had hoaxes played on them,\" says Smith.\nDespite the expectation, the build-up, the prank calls, and sometimes year after year of disappointment – the typical reaction is one of great surprise. \"No matter how much they might have been told by people that it might come one day, it's incredibly surprising when it happens,\" says Smith. \"They are genuinely amazed. It takes their breath away, I suppose, in almost all cases.\"\nThat said, you really can't generalise: once or twice, a new laureate has been quite perturbed by Smith's call. Konstantin Novoselov, who shared the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of graphene, and Arthur Ashkin who shared the same prize in 2018 for developing optical tweezers to move tiny objects using lasers, both gave Smith the same disgruntled reaction: \"You mean I have to stop my experiment? I'm kind of busy.\"\nSome, like Louise Glück, who won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature, had very mixed feelings – and were simply desperate for a coffee.\nSometimes, Smith might be expecting a tricky call but is pleasantly surprised.\nWhen Doris Lessing won the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature, she famously received the news after getting out of a taxi laden with bags of shopping. Her reaction to the reporter who broke the news to her was dismissive to say the least, waving him away and saying, \"Oh, Christ,\" before dropping her shopping to the street with a thump.\n\"I spoke to her very shortly afterwards,\" says Smith. \"I knew what had happened, and I thought, 'This is not going to go well.'\"\nBut in fact Smith was \"tremendously happy\" with the call. \"We connected enough that she was happy, and she was enjoying the conversation, and that was one that I was very proud of, because I'd felt that she was going to be impossible.\"\nThe call with Alice Munro, who won the 2013 literature prize, also caused Smith some trepidation beforehand. But the conversation went well, with Smith describing it as \"thrilling\" to find her a good interviewee.\nIn some calls, it's all Smith can do to hang on – one of those was with Roger Penrose, who shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\"He thinks so fast, and he talks fast,\" says Smith. \"It began with the fact that his assistant had just been doing his hair – so we started pretty mundane, and by the end of the conversation we got to the end of the Universe, disappearing into supermassive black holes and re-emerging as the next universe. And you know, that's a long way to travel in conversation.\n\"It did feel like you were holding on to the saddle, and just trying desperately not to fall off.\"\nAfter 18 years of making these calls, Smith says he still feels a little hesitant about disturbing the new laureates as they enjoy the glow of their win, especially if it is the middle of their night. \"All this chasing of people – it's not a very comfortable thing to do. Because, although the person will probably be happy when they get on the phone with you, you know you're intruding.\"\nSmith describes the calls themselves as \"very intense\". \"I can feel elated or depressed, depending on whether it's worked or not.\n\"You know absolutely whether you've connected with somebody, and they're listening to you, or whether it's just been a rather formulaic thing,\" says Smith. \"If I feel that we've connected, it's wonderful. And of course I'm very happy. And if it's been less than satisfactory, of course it's sad. It's a missed opportunity, and it only comes once.\"\nAt the end of a busy week of announcements, Smith reflects on his role in taking a snapshot at a momentous time.\n\"In a way, this call that I make is just to say, 'Hi, how are you?

Finding common ground on issues such as the environment, foreign policy and gun control appears to be difficult, according to some research. But what is this doing to people's friendships?\nAccording to the prevailing narrative, the severe differences in worldview are causing our social networks to fracture, resulting in many broken friendships. But is this objectively true? And if so, what psychological factors are most likely to predict the changes to our social networks?\nThis is what psychologist Ian MacRae and I hoped to explore with our Friendship Study – a short questionnaire offered to BBC.com readers in July and August this year. We were delighted that 1,912 of you participated. For our first analysis, we examined answers from the US and Canada – the primary audience of the BBC international website – with 726 responses from people living in these countries, aged from 19 to 90. We then explored whether the same patterns could be seen in other regions.\nFirst, some caveats: our respondents were limited to people who read BBC.com. Our participants were also self-selecting, meaning that they are not a representative sample of the entire population. Nevertheless, their responses do fit with broader trends noted in the academic research, which suggest that we are often overly pessimistic about other's intentions in social interactions.\nOn average, our participants did not report finding it harder to talk about politics today than in the past. Many people reported gaining friends, as well as losing them, due to these discussions, suggesting that political engagement can sometimes enhance connection. In line with previous studies, however, we found they overestimated how much others wanted to create an argument over differences in opinion – an assumption that may hamper the free exchange of ideas and potentially stand in the way of forging new friendships.\nIf you would like to fill in the questionnaire and receive personalised results, before you read a more detailed discussion of our participants' responses, it is available here.\nOur first questions asked participants to describe the general impact of political conversations on their relationships over the past 10 years – by rating a series of statements on a five-point scale from one (strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree).\nSurprisingly, the average participant responded fairly neutrally to the statement: \"It is harder for me to discuss political issues today, than it was 10 years ago\". They were slightly more likely to agree with the statement: \"Other people find it harder to discuss political issues today, compared with 10 years ago\" but it was a very small difference. Overall, our participants did not consider political disagreement to be a recent phenomenon.\nNor did they appear to have strong views about the overall effects on their social networks. On average, they were just as likely to agree with the statement \"my conversations about political issues have caused me to gain social connections\" as they were to agree with the statement \"my conversations about political issues have caused me to lose social connections\". Overall, their perceived gains and losses were almost exactly equal. We don't know the exact nature of these changes, but it is plausible that people are breaking some ties with the people of opposing views, and then building new friendships with those that have similar opinions.\nThe overall trend, however, might seem surprising in a world that is portrayed as being rift by increasingly polarised perspectives. Certainly, there is evidence in the academic research that who you choose to be friends with can affect the strength of the views you hold – hang out only with people who hold the same views as you and those opinions will likely become more radical and entrenched. The effect is often seen within online social media networks, where political homophily can create echo-chambers that amplify people's ideologies. But there is just also considerable evidence that regularly talking to, or engaging with, people who hold different views from yourself can help to lessen polarisation of opinions.\nMany of our participants reported that they were willing to connect across the aisle. Just 32% of the US and Canadian participants agreed with the statement \"it is important to me that others share my political views\", while others were either neutral (25%) or disagreed (43%).\nIt would be interesting to see if this variety of opinion is unique to our self-selecting group of participants. Many media articles have described people's experiences of losing friendships due to ideological differences, but our participants' answers to our questionnaire suggest it may make more sense to look at the general changeability of people's social networks – the movement of people both in and out of our friendship groups.\nFor those worried about losing friends, however, it might seem natural to assume that the best way to preserve our existing friendships is to keep quiet about our political opinions to avoid conflict. To explore this question, we asked participants to \"consider your day-to-day discussions with your friends, family, colleagues and strangers. How often do you disguise your opinions about social or political issues to avoid conflict?\" Counter-intuitively, we found that the people who regularly hide their feelings were more likely to report having lost friends through political discussions.\nWe can't be certain about the direction of causality here. These people may have decided to conceal their opinions as a reaction to some difficult exchanges that had broken their bonds with loved ones. It is also possible, however, that the reverse is true: the secrecy about their true opinions has harmed their relationships. We know, after all, that honesty is highly valued by others and can contribute to deeper and more authentic bonds. Disguising their true beliefs may have been socially isolating.\nConversational goals\nWe next examined people's goals in their conversations around politics: what did they hope to achieve, and what did they believe that others hoped to achieve when talking about politics with someone from \"across the aisle\"?\nWhile writing my book The Laws of Connection, I discovered research showing that our assumptions about other people's intentions are often wildly misplaced. These misperceptions can shape our subsequent interactions.\nFor example, Hanne Collins, an assistant professor of management and organisations at the University of California, Los Angeles, and her colleagues recently asked participants to imagine having a five-minute conversation with someone they disagreed with about politics or sports. They first had to rate how important, on a scale of one (not at all) to five (extremely), each of the following goals would be for them in the conversation:\nAnd\nAfter answering for themselves, the participants had to guess how important each of those goals would be for their conversation partner, using the same scale.\nCollins and her team found stark differences in participants' perceptions of themselves and others. Compared to their own ratings, they tended to overestimate how much other people would want to persuade them to change their mind. They would also underestimate how much other people would want to discover and understand their point of view. In other words, people say they are willing to learn themselves, but don't believe others have the same goal, says Collins.\nWe saw the same perception gap in our sample. Participants believed that learning about an alternative viewpoint would be less important to other people, compared to themselves – with average scores of 2.98 and 3.97 on the five-point scale. They rated persuasion, in contrast, as being more important to others than themselves – at 3.30 compared to 2.77 on the five-point scale.\nCollins is positive about the results. \"It's always exciting to see your results replicate –especially with such amazing samples of respondents and with large effect sizes,\" she says.\nThe impact this has on our social interactions is important. Collins's experiments suggest that these perception gaps may create more hostile attitudes towards conversation partners. When we believe that someone lacks a genuine interest in learning about our beliefs, we tend to become more defensive and less open-minded, she says. We also tend to evaluate them as being less moral and trustworthy. None of which would set the stage for a constructive interaction.\nThe reverse is true when people believe that learning is a higher priority for the other person. \"Even when we keep the arguments constant – people who believe the same argument was written by someone with high learning goals will evaluate it more positively,\" says Collins.\nOur data suggest that people's perceptions of those conversational goals may be affecting the structure of their social circles. The stronger people's intentions for both persuasion and learning, the lower the stability of their networks, with greater numbers of losses and gains.\nIn our study, we also considered a purely antisocial intention, asking participants to rate how important it would be to \"start an argument\" between themselves and someone they were talking to. As you might hope, most people rated this as being a very low priority for themselves, but they tended to overestimate how important it would be for others. In total, around 54% of the participants experienced this \"perception gap\", which could reduce the chances of having an honest and friendly discussion. Just 3% underestimated other's inclination to argue. \nHow do these patterns vary by country? The results described so far are based on responses from the US and Canada. Our global pool included nearly 2,000 participants – a large sample by the standard of most psychological experiments, although worth remembering it is limited to people who are readers of BBC.com. When we expanded our analyses to include this data, we did not see any major differences in people's perceptions or behaviour. The only statistically significant difference concerned the question of whether it was harder to discuss politics now, compared with 10 years ago: participants from the rest of the world were slightly less likely to endorse this view than those in North America.\nWe also didn't see any significant gender differences, besides the fact that men report being more willing to discuss controversial topics than women.\nWhen taken together, our study, combined with the existing academic literature, might offer some grounds for optimism about the state of social connection in the 21th Century. In our sample, at least, many people were willing to connect across the political divide. We are often needlessly cynical about other's wishes to understand us, when they may be just as concerned as we are to have a respectful exchange of opinions.\nAs I shall explore in our next article, we can make the most of this fact by learning evidence-based strategies that encourage more open and honest discussions over polarised topics.\n* David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author of The Laws of Connection, which examines 13 science-based strategies to transform your social life, published by Canongate (UK & Commonwealth)/Pegasus (US and Canada). He is @d_a_robson on X and @davidarobson on Instagram and Threads.\n** The Friendship Study was created with Ian MacRae, a psychologist, independent researcher and author of books about personality, leadership and the psychology of technology.

Uncannily charismatic, he carries the practised ease of someone who knows the destabilising effect their presence can have on regular people.He takes time to greet every member of the BBC's film crew individually, then breaks the ice with a joke about a journalist who mistakenly called him “Springstein”. That reminds me of a local radio DJ in Belfast who always used to introduce him as “Bruce Springsprong”.“Really?” he laughs. “Well, I’ve been called worse.”In fact, we've been pre-warned that he doesn't like being called The Boss – the nickname coined in the early days of his career with The E Street Band, when he'd be responsible for collecting and distributing the takings after a show.“I hate being called 'Boss',\" he told Creem magazine in 1980. \"Always did, from the beginning. I hate bosses. I hate being called the boss.”The term is conspicuously absent from his new Disney+ documentary, Road Diary, which charts the process of putting together Springsteen’s first tour since the pandemic – from handwritten notebooks to footage of his band “shaking off the cobwebs” after six years apart.At times, the preparations lack the rigour you might expect.“It’s all a little bit casual,” frets Steve Van Zandt, Springsteen’s guitarist and one of his oldest friends, after the star calls time on rehearsals.“There’s a certain percentage [of songs] that we’re gonna [screw] up anyway,” Springsteen retorts. “That’s what they’re paying for. They want to see it live. That means a few mistakes!”\nIf you’ve caught any of the star’s recent shows, you'll know the stakes are never that high. The band are tighter than a tourniquet. Mistakes are noticeably absent.The documentary comes exactly 60 years after Springsteen’s first gig, playing an $18 guitar with a band called The Rogues. He’s never let anyone film the inner workings of his shows before, so why do it on this tour?“Well, because I could be dead by the next one,” he laughs. “I'm 75 years old now. I've decided that the waiting-to-do-things part of my life is over.\"“We're closer to the end than we are to the beginning,” agrees Van Zandt, “but the point of this tour was that we’re not going out quietly, man.“We're going to balance that mortality with vitality.That philosophy was fully on display at Sunderland’s Stadium of Light in May, when Springsteen braved torrential rain to play for three hours to 50,000 drenched fans.The weather was so brutal that Springsteen lost his voice. Doctors ordered him not to sing for a week, forcing him to postpone several shows.What made him continue?“Well, I'm there to have a good time,” he says. “I'm going to insist on it, whether it's raining or the sun is shining - because I'm there for the people that are there.“I look out and I go, ‘These are my people. These are the people who've listened to my music for the past 30 or 40 years. I'm going to do the best show I possibly can', you know?“It sounds corny, but you have to love your audience and, for the most part, I've never found that hard to do.”\nIt took audiences a while to reciprocate, however.Born in New Jersey, to Douglas Springsteen, a bus driver, and Adele Springsteen, a secretary, Bruce paid little attention to music until he saw Elvis Presley on the Ed Sullivan Show and bought himself a guitar.He spent his teens playing around the city with a Beatles-inspired band named The Castiles (after a brand of shampoo), taking gigs wherever they’d have him.“I've played pizza parlours, I've played bowling alleys. I’ve played [psychiatric] hospitals and Sing Sing prison. I even played a supermarket opening once,” he recalls.\nBack then, the setlist was all R&B covers and Motown hits - but Springsteen was a nervous performer. In his autobiography, he talks about blinking 100 times a minute and chewing his knuckles. Van Zandt calls him “the most introverted guy you’ve met in your whole life\".So how did he become the performer who, with the E Street Band, started tearing up stages all around the world?“Introversion is a funny thing,” he says. “There's a yin and a yang to it.“On my own, I can be very internal. I've written a lot of internal music - Darkness On The Edge Of Town, Nebraska, parts of The River - all about people who live these very intense, borderline violent, internal lives.“But the joyful side of me, which I got from my mother, allows me to sing Rosalita and Born to Run and Hungry Heart. \"I'm Irish-Italian, so I got the blues and I got the joy at the same time.”It’s a typical Springsteen answer – analytical, sincere, intrinsically linking his life to his music. Van Zandt, who witnessed Springsteen’s transformation, sees it differently.“His first two records didn’t do well. Record companies were ready to drop him. His only dream was about to die. “So my very shy friend reaches inside and says, ‘I'll put the guitar down and start fronting the band', which is huge move, right? Because the guitar's a defence, it’s actually a wall between you and your audience. So he had to put that away and learn a whole new craft.”It all came to a head at New York's Bottom Line Club, shortly before the release of Springsteen’s breakout album Born To Run in 1975.Over the course of five nights and 10 shows, the star showcased his new sound to fans, journalists and radio progammers.\"And all of a sudden, he’s dancing on the tables,” Van Zandt recalls. “I’m like, ‘Wow, where'd that come from?’“I think it was sort of a defensive urge, like, ‘You're not going to stop me’.”\nWhatever it was, it worked. Born To Run was a massive commercial success, selling six million copies in the US alone.The album was constructed with the same desperation as those live shows, pieced together over 14 months (six of them on the title track alone) as Springsteen fought and scraped to save his career.The songs – Thunder Road, Jungleland, Born To Run – throbbed with longing, as his characters fought to escape the confines of small-town, blue collar American life.It's a story he was familiar with. As a child, he witnessed the chilling effects of unemployment and the Vietnam War on his neighbourhood.His subsequent rise to fame reads like a movie treatment for the American Dream, but he’s aware that luck and timing played a role.\n“I wouldn't want to be a young band starting today,” he says. “The day of the quote ‘rock star’ is in twilight.\"But I've had some encouragement. My young friend, Zach Bryan, just sold out two stadium nights in Philadelphia, so there's still some young people coming up.\"Watch the full Bruce Springsteen interview on BBC iPlayerNo-one can match Springsteen, though, and he's increasingly aware that time's against him.His last two albums confront mortality head-on, prompted by the realisation that he was the “last man standing” from his teenage band The Castiles.On tour, he pays tribute to the E Street musicians who’ve crossed The River. Meanwhile his wife, Patti Scialfa, has cut back her appearances with the band, after being diagnosed with myeloma, a rare blood cancer, in 2018.“She's doing well, we caught it early,” Springsteen says.“She's having a tough time at the moment because she needs to have a shoulder replaced and a hip replaced. So that, on top of the myeloma, makes it very difficult for her to get out and get around.“But she's made a beautiful new record that'll be coming out, hopefully, this year. And we’ve been married for 34 years. I love her to death.”\nDespite the realities of age, Springsteen isn't slowing down.

Learn a little bit about yourself.”What has he learnt on his latest tour?“Let me see,” he says, leaning back to think.“I learnt that my back really hurts a lot.”\nRoad Diary: Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band premieres on 25 October on Disney+."]}

Thanks for any info! http://web.archive.org/web/20030202021626/http:/home.", "“The louder you can talk, the better, because I've played rock and roll for 50 years.”Bruce Springsteen has just E Street Shuffled into the room. Uncannily charismatic, he carries the practised ease of someone who knows the destabilising effect their presence can have on regular people.He takes time to greet every member of the BBC's film crew individually, then breaks the ice with a joke about a journalist who mistakenly called him “Springstein”. That reminds me of a local radio DJ in Belfast who always used to introduce him as “Bruce Springsprong”.“Really?” he laughs. “Well, I’ve been called worse.”In fact, we've been pre-warned that he doesn't like being called The Boss – the nickname coined in the early days of his career with The E Street Band, when he'd be responsible for collecting and distributing the takings after a show.“I hate being called 'Boss',\" he told Creem magazine in 1980. \"Always did, from the beginning. I hate bosses. I hate being called the boss.”The term is conspicuously absent from his new Disney+ documentary, Road Diary, which charts the process of putting together Springsteen’s first tour since the pandemic – from handwritten notebooks to footage of his band “shaking off the cobwebs” after six years apart.At times, the preparations lack the rigour you might expect.“It’s all a little bit casual,” frets Steve Van Zandt, Springsteen’s guitarist and one of his oldest friends, after the star calls time on rehearsals.“There’s a certain percentage [of songs] that we’re gonna [screw] up anyway,” Springsteen retorts. “That’s what they’re paying for. They want to see it live. That means a few mistakes!”\nIf you’ve caught any of the star’s recent shows, you'll know the stakes are never that high. The band are tighter than a tourniquet. Mistakes are noticeably absent.The documentary comes exactly 60 years after Springsteen’s first gig, playing an $18 guitar with a band called The Rogues. He’s never let anyone film the inner workings of his shows before, so why do it on this tour?“Well, because I could be dead by the next one,” he laughs. “I'm 75 years old now. I've decided that the waiting-to-do-things part of my life is over.\"“We're closer to the end than we are to the beginning,” agrees Van Zandt, “but the point of this tour was that we’re not going out quietly, man.“We're going to balance that mortality with vitality.That philosophy was fully on display at Sunderland’s Stadium of Light in May, when Springsteen braved torrential rain to play for three hours to 50,000 drenched fans.The weather was so brutal that Springsteen lost his voice. Doctors ordered him not to sing for a week, forcing him to postpone several shows.What made him continue?“Well, I'm there to have a good time,” he says. “I'm going to insist on it, whether it's raining or the sun is shining - because I'm there for the people that are there.“I look out and I go, ‘These are my people. These are the people who've listened to my music for the past 30 or 40 years. I'm going to do the best show I possibly can', you know?“It sounds corny, but you have to love your audience and, for the most part, I've never found that hard to do.”\nIt took audiences a while to reciprocate, however.Born in New Jersey, to Douglas Springsteen, a bus driver, and Adele Springsteen, a secretary, Bruce paid little attention to music until he saw Elvis Presley on the Ed Sullivan Show and bought himself a guitar.He spent his teens playing around the city with a Beatles-inspired band named The Castiles (after a brand of shampoo), taking gigs wherever they’d have him.“I've played pizza parlours, I've played bowling alleys. I’ve played [psychiatric] hospitals and Sing Sing prison. I even played a supermarket opening once,” he recalls.\nBack then, the setlist was all R&B covers and Motown hits - but Springsteen was a nervous performer. In his autobiography, he talks about blinking 100 times a minute and chewing his knuckles. Van Zandt calls him “the most introverted guy you’ve met in your whole life\".So how did he become the performer who, with the E Street Band, started tearing up stages all around the world?“Introversion is a funny thing,” he says. “There's a yin and a yang to it.“On my own, I can be very internal. I've written a lot of internal music - Darkness On The Edge Of Town, Nebraska, parts of The River - all about people who live these very intense, borderline violent, internal lives.“But the joyful side of me, which I got from my mother, allows me to sing Rosalita and Born to Run and Hungry Heart. \"I'm Irish-Italian, so I got the blues and I got the joy at the same time.”It’s a typical Springsteen answer – analytical, sincere, intrinsically linking his life to his music. Van Zandt, who witnessed Springsteen’s transformation, sees it differently.“His first two records didn’t do well. Record companies were ready to drop him. His only dream was about to die. “So my very shy friend reaches inside and says, ‘I'll put the guitar down and start fronting the band', which is huge move, right? Because the guitar's a defence, it’s actually a wall between you and your audience. So he had to put that away and learn a whole new craft.”It all came to a head at New York's Bottom Line Club, shortly before the release of Springsteen’s breakout album Born To Run in 1975.Over the course of five nights and 10 shows, the star showcased his new sound to fans, journalists and radio progammers.\"And all of a sudden, he’s dancing on the tables,” Van Zandt recalls. “I’m like, ‘Wow, where'd that come from?’“I think it was sort of a defensive urge, like, ‘You're not going to stop me’.”\nWhatever it was, it worked. Born To Run was a massive commercial success, selling six million copies in the US alone.The album was constructed with the same desperation as those live shows, pieced together over 14 months (six of them on the title track alone) as Springsteen fought and scraped to save his career.The songs – Thunder Road, Jungleland, Born To Run – throbbed with longing, as his characters fought to escape the confines of small-town, blue collar American life.It's a story he was familiar with. As a child, he witnessed the chilling effects of unemployment and the Vietnam War on his neighbourhood.His subsequent rise to fame reads like a movie treatment for the American Dream, but he’s aware that luck and timing played a role.\n“I wouldn't want to be a young band starting today,” he says. “The day of the quote ‘rock star’ is in twilight.\"But I've had some encouragement. My young friend, Zach Bryan, just sold out two stadium nights in Philadelphia, so there's still some young people coming up.\"Watch the full Bruce Springsteen interview on BBC iPlayerNo-one can match Springsteen, though, and he's increasingly aware that time's against him.His last two albums confront mortality head-on, prompted by the realisation that he was the “last man standing” from his teenage band The Castiles.On tour, he pays tribute to the E Street musicians who’ve crossed The River. Meanwhile his wife, Patti Scialfa, has cut back her appearances with the band, after being diagnosed with myeloma, a rare blood cancer, in 2018.“She's doing well, we caught it early,” Springsteen says.“She's having a tough time at the moment because she needs to have a shoulder replaced and a hip replaced. So that, on top of the myeloma, makes it very difficult for her to get out and get around.“But she's made a beautiful new record that'll be coming out, hopefully, this year. And we’ve been married for 34 years. I love her to death.”\nDespite the realities of age, Springsteen isn't slowing down. He’s back in Europe next summer to make up for the concerts he missed after Sunderland, adding another 12 dates for good measure.“Do you think you can outlast The E Street Band?”, he demands every night, daring the audience to meet their energy, joule for joule.Their shared history is the show's heartbeat.

Instead, their dog tags were removed and they were lined up and executed on the orders of Capt Fritz Knoechlein, of the 3rd SS Division (Totenkopf).Amazingly, Pte Pooley and Pte O'Callaghan survived the massacre and imprisonment, and were able to bring Knoechlein to justice after the war. \n\"Farmer Jean-Charles Dufour sent me an email last year which just stunned me, saying we've found two helmets when we were clearing up the farm for sale,\" said Mr Head.Mr Storey, a Norfolk-based military historian, was asked to identify them and he confirmed they were World War One issue, which had been repurposed.

It pulls from the From Software-developed Souls games that I love so much, but from my brief time with the game and a short interview with its creative director I wasn’t convinced that it could capture the unexpected magic of that series.", "Instead of a single book about a single album, however, each book they published would deep-dive into an individual game (a dream that has since been realised by the good people at Boss Fight Books). I’d volunteered to write Press Select's volume on Dark Souls. I had a title ready to go: Nobody Wants To See You Go Hollow: The Story of Dark Souls.", "] When Keza surprised me with a Google Chat message in January of 2015 to ask if I had any interest in teaming up to write a book about Dark Souls, I was already working on my own Dark Souls book for a separate publisher.", "Furthermore we didn’t expect any mainstream, non-endemic press to have any interest in our Dark Souls ruminations (spoiler: they didn’t). If the video-game community was already writing about the legacy of the Dark Souls series on the occasion of the trilogy’s conclusion, perhaps they’d be more inclined to reference our book.", "While it’s likely we’ll see future Souls games, From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki has expressed interest in doing something else–and these are the trademarks of his company’s titles I’d like to see in whatever they make next.", "\"Why don't you make music for video games?\" is a question Sean Long gets asked a lot.The guitarist, part of Sheffield-based While She Sleeps, says fans often suggest titles they think would be a perfect fit for the metalcore band's sound.He's not surprised by the crossover - heavy music and gaming can both be seen as outsider interests.\"Maybe it's a slight sense of not feeling like you're really fitting in with the majority, which is so common,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.\"You find other means to express yourself and the stuff that everyone else seems to be doing maybe isn't resonating with you as much.\" Sean remembers being in his bedroom at 01:00, riffing on his guitar, lost in music, and sees parallels with gaming there.\"You find yourself in another universe, completely in this unconscious realm,\" he says. \"And when you're making the music, there's a similar aspect. \"Positive escapism.\"Sean says he'd love to make music for a video game. But he wouldn't know where to start.\nIt's a situation guitarist Scott Le Page and bassist Clay Gober, from Texas-based rock band Polyphia, recognise too.The pair tell Newsbeat they're \"pretty avid gamers\" - Clay's a fan of titles by acclaimed directors Hideo Kojima and Ken Levine, Scott loves the notoriously challenging Dark Souls series - and keen to work in the area.\"We were kind of looking for an opportunity to do what we already do and add that to our hobby and kind of mix those two worlds together,\" says Scott.Even though Sean and the Polyphia boys are members of two established bands with more than two million monthly listeners between them, all three told BBC Newsbeat they hadn't cracked the games industry.Despite the crossover between fandoms, there is still a lack of transparency and understanding between music and gaming.But their potential foot in the door came from a breakout indie hit.\nCult of the Lamb is a quirky 2022 release featuring cute cartoon animals the player must turn into loyal followers of an entity known as The One Who Waits.It was a big success for developer Massive Monster and publisher Devolver Digital, who commissioned Scott, Clay and Sean to create a collection of heavy metal covers versions of the game's soundtrack.They appear on the six-track EP - Cult of the Lamb: Hymns of the Unholy - with members of bands including Killswitch Engage, Trivium and Monuments.Given the game's themes, it's easy to see why the crossover made sense to the artists, and they say the creative opportunity appealed to them.Sean says: \"I'm so aware of how important soundtracks are, especially when you're younger and you really immerse in those games. \"It's so special and it really plays a part in the way that you listen to things as you grow up.\"Scott, from Polyphia, says it was a chance for him to step outside his comfort zone and experiment with a different style of rock music.\"It opened up a little bit of my thought process of writing,\" he says.Both bands hope it could be a step towards them doing more work in the gaming space.But the singer of one band took matters into his own hands.\nDan Tompkins, lead singer of progressive metal band Tesseract, has been working on a game based around the band's fifth album, War of Being.He started live-streaming on Twitch during the Covid-19 pandemic and experimenting with VR performances.That inspired him to team up with a programmer, designer and concept artist, as well as teaching himself to use video game engine Unreal 5 to create the virtual reality game.Players navigate a world based on the album, unlocking parts of a song which they get to hear in full at the end.War of Being has had a positive reaction since the release of an early access version, which Dan is continuing to work on alongside making music.He admits the project has \"just kind of snowballed and gotten bigger and bigger and bigger,\" and probably isn't something many others could replicate.But he estimates that the band's following has grown by thousands since he started working on the game, and it has helped them make connections within gaming.Tesseract recently recorded an end credits track for Wild West-themed shooter Soulslinger and he thinks tie-ups like this will become more achievable in future.For him, he sees it as one of the ways bands can \"develop a following and retain it and reward your fans for their commitment to supporting you and doing interesting things.\"\nThere's a long relationship between videogames and alternative music, from early first-person shooter Doom to games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Guitar Hero.Gaming scores and soundtracks are now recognised by mainstream organisations like the Grammy Awards, and live performances of videogame soundtracks are becoming increasingly popular.With the costs of touring rising and rates from streaming services low, could gaming be another way for bands to support themselves?Scott admits \"it's certainly nice to see more royalties come in from doing anything at all\", but says he thinks doing something purely for the money means you're doing it for the wrong reasons.Sean from While She Sleeps agrees that it's important to leave space for creatively fulfilling work, but says artists still have bills to pay.\"Make sure there's enough integral space to make sure that you're writing your main projects for the love of the music,\" he says.\nDo they have a dream project?Scott says anything by From Software, the developer of his beloved Dark Souls, would make him \"literally pinch myself and be like: 'Hang on a second, am I dreaming?\"Polyphia band-mate Clay says: \"Anything made by Ken Levine. I'm a big Bioshock guy and I grew up playing Thief and all the sequels to that.\"So that would be something that would make me evaporate into thin air with excitement.\"Sean says he's recently rediscovered the original Tomb Raider soundtrack, which \"holds an incredibly deep place within my subconscious from being a kid\".\"Make it all high quality like the new ones are, but it needs to be exactly the same as number one, maybe number two, and then I'll do a score for that. \"And I'll do it at half price as well.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."]}

That is in front of the camera, behind the camera and also in financing, distribution, marketing and showing the final product.He imagines that just as movie audiences around the world know the differences between the US cities of New York and Los Angeles without necessarily ever having visited them, they will one day have a more nuanced understanding of the continent.\n\"This sector is a soft power, not just across Ghana but across Africa.\"If you watch any film or anything that has got to do with Africa, all you’re going to see is trauma, how we were slaves, how we were colonised, how it’s just war and when you come to Africa, you will realise that it’s not true.\"So, it’s really important that we own those stories of our tradition, of our culture, of our languages, of the differences between one language and another. The world doesn’t know that.\"With Nigeria’s Nollywood producing hundreds of movies a year, films are arguably one of the country’s most successful exports. There is also a tradition, especially in parts of Francophone Africa, of making high-quality films.Elba has previously recognised the talent in Africa's film industry, but said the facilities were \"lacking\".A 2022 report from Unesco backed up the actor.The UN's cultural agency said that despite \"significant growth in production\", the business of film-making across the continent was hindered by issues such as piracy, insubstantial training opportunities and a lack of official film institutions.Elba believes with the right momentum and involvement of governments willing to create an enabling environment, a virtuous circle can be established.\"We have to invest in our story-telling because when you see me, you see a little version of yourself and that encourages us.\"\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica"]}

A man called Stephen Mollah, who had been sat silently on the side the whole time walked up and resolutely declared: “I am here to make a statement that yes: I am Satoshi Nakamoto and I created the Bitcoin on Blockchain technology.”Over the following hour, reporters went from amused to irritated as he failed to provide any of the promised evidence for his claims.Mr Mollah promised that he would make the Hail-Mary move of unlocking and interacting with the first-ever Bitcoins to be created - something that only Satoshi could do. But he didn't.I departed, along with other bemused reporters, taking with us any lingering doubts that this would prove to be yet another dead-end in the quest to unmask Satoshi.\nThe list of those identified - unsuccessfully - as Satoshi Nakamoto is long.In 2014, a high-profile article in Newsweek said it was Dorian Nakamoto, a Japanese-American man living in California.But he denied it and the claim has largely been debunked.A year later, Australian computer scientist Craig Wright was outed as Satoshi by reporters. He denied it, before saying it was true - but then failed over many years to produce any evidence.In the spring the High Court in London ruled that Mr Wright was not the inventor.\nTech billionaire and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk also denied he was behind the cryptocurrency after a former employee at one of his firms, SpaceX, suggested it.Which brings us to the question: does it really matter?The crypto market's current valuation means it is worth more than Google. And it seems inconceivable that the tech giant would play such a big role in our lives without people knowing who founded it, and owned a sizeable chunk of the firm.Perhaps there’s good reason for the real Satoshi to keep schtum though. That bitcoin stash would make them worth an estimated $69bn and their life and character would no doubt be heavily scrutinised if they were found.  Peter Todd, who was named by the HBO documentary as being Satoshi, said the unwelcome attention he's received has made him fearful for his safety.Many in the crypto world enjoy the fact that the mystery remains unsolved. \"No-one knows who Satoshi is and that's a good thing,\" Adam Back, one of its core developers (and another potential Satoshi candidate) posted on X recently.Natalie Brunell, a Bitcoin podcaster, thinks Satoshi's anonymity is not only deliberate but essential.\"By concealing his true identity, Satoshi ensured that Bitcoin wouldn’t have a leader or central figure, whose personal agenda could influence the protocol,\" she told me.\"This allows people to trust Bitcoin as a system, rather than placing their trust in an individual or company.\"Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University - who lectures on the history of Bitcoin - is less sure.In her view, the circus around who Satoshi Nakamoto is distracts from people looking into - and getting to grips with - the more serious question of how cryptocurrencies might upend the way the economy works.As I left the Frontline Club it was hard to compute the bizarre press event, beyond one obvious fact.For now - and perhaps forever - the search for Satoshi continues."]}

Its share price rocketed to $321.Fast forward three years and that price has slumped to just under $5 - and the company is worth 2% of what it once was.What went wrong?\nAccording to Professor Dimitris Andriosopoulos, founder of the Responsible Business Unit at Strathclyde University, the problem for 23andMe was twofold.  Firstly, it didn’t really have a continuing business model – once you’d paid for your DNA report, there was very little for you to return for. Secondly, plans to use an anonymised version of the gathered DNA database for drug research took too long to become profitable, because the drug development process takes so many years.That leads him to a blunt conclusion: “If I had a crystal ball, I’d say they will maybe last for a bit longer,” he told the BBC.“But as it currently is, in my view, 23andMe is highly unlikely to survive.”\nThe problems at 23andMe are reflected in the turmoil in its leadership.The board resigned in the summer and only the CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki – sister of the late YouTube boss Susan Wojcicki and ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergei Brin – remains from the original line-up.Rumours have swirled that the firm will shortly either fold or be sold - claims that it rejects.\"23andMe’s co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki has publicly shared she intends to take the company private, and is not open to considering third party takeover proposals,\" the company said in a statement.But that hasn’t stopped the speculation, with rival firm Ancestry calling for US competition regulators to get involved if 23andMe does end up for sale.\nCompanies rising and falling is nothing new - especially in tech. But 23andMe is different.\"It's worrying because of the sensitivity of the data,\" says Carissa Veliz, author of Privacy is Power.And that is not just for the individuals who have used the firm.\"If you gave your data to 23andMe, you also gave the genetic data of your parents, your siblings, your children, and even distant kin who did not consent to that,\" she told the BBC.David Stillwell, professor of computational social science at Cambridge Judge Business School, agrees the stakes are high.“DNA data is different. If your bank account details are hacked, it will be disruptive but you can get a new bank account,\" he explained.\"If your (non-identical) sibling has used it, they share 50% of your DNA, so their data can still be used to make health predictions about you.”The company is adamant these kinds of concerns are without foundation.\"Any company that handles consumer information, including the type of data we collect, there are applicable data protections set out in law required to be followed as part of any future ownership change,\" it said in its statement.\"The 23andMe terms of service and privacy statement would remain in place unless and until customers are presented with, and agree to, new terms and statements.\"There are also legal protections which apply in the UK under its version of the data protection law, GDPR, whether the firm goes bust or changes hands.Even so, all companies can be hacked - as 23andMe was 12 months ago.And Carissa Veliz remains uneasy - and says ultimately a much robust approach is needed if we want to keep our most personal information safe.\"The terms and conditions of these companies are typically incredibly inclusive; when you give out your personal data to them, you allow them to do pretty much anything they want with it,\" she said.\"Until we ban the trade in personal data, we are not well protected enough.\"Additional reporting by Tom Gerken"]}

If we can't find that draught you then have to go down the route of did someone push that door?\"\nNear the main entrance we pass a photograph of a woman who could be our first ghost.Anne Hay-Mackenzie, Countess of Cromartie, was a key figure in Strathpeffer's transformation from a farm to a bustling spa resort.Wealthy Victorians travelled from as far as London believing the local sulphur and iron-rich water had healing powers.The countess helped plan the village and designed its pavilion.The aristocrat glares back from her photograph.Maybe she was pretending to be annoyed or was in bad mood at the time the picture was taken. It's said she had a deep dislike of her husband, the 3rd Duke of Sutherland.\nOur group heads up to a balcony overlooking the hall. Men have reported feeling uncomfortable in this part of the building, and Highland Paranormal suspects the countess is the cause.The investigators have equipment they say can provide clues to potential paranormal activity.They have EMF meters to detect changes in electromagnetic fields, audio recorders and a camera.A set of dowsing rods are handed round for us to try.They are similar to divining rods some claim can be used to find water, and that UK water companies have used in the past to search for underground pipes.In paranormal investigations ghosts are asked to move the rods to answer \"yes\" and \"no\" to questions.BBC producer David Gray makes his first attempt at using the rods.After a few questions, he asks if there is a spirit could it point to where presenter Grace Nicoll is standing.The rods slowly swing towards Grace.”They like you,” says David.\nNext, a spirit box is set up.It's an electronic system that rapidly shifts between AM frequencies as part of a process paranormal investigators claim can be manipulated by ghosts to form words. It fizzes with white noise punctuated by short bursts of music and words.Someone in our group asks if we should leave the balcony. The word \"yes\" crackles from the device.It's decided to bid the countess, if she's there, farewell and investigate a small upstairs attic on the other side of the hall.\nSince arriving, we've been hearing soft thuds and knocks from that side of the building.Just the sunny day causing an old building to creak and groan, or something uncanny?We cross the hall. On its wooden floor the team has placed \"triggers\", clusters of objects that might be familiar to a ghost. For this investigation they include war medals and bandages.During World War One the pavilion was a US Navy hospital and the hall was lined with beds filled with casualties. It's been suggested a nurse and an injured sailor are among our spooks.Also on the floor are cat toys, little plastic balls that light up when touched.I accidentally kick one sending it skittering across the floor, and causing a brief moment of excitement before I apologetically explain it was me and not a ghost.\nFrom a darkened corridor we climb a narrow, twisting flight of stairs to the attic.The room is small with a low roof and it's hot from the pavilion's heating.The spirit of a young person is said to haunt the attic and Liam soon reports a spike in activity on a meter.The dowsing rods are handed to Grace who, like David, has been trying them for the first time.She asks if the spirit is happy to see us. The rods cross indicating \"yes\".Grace asks if it can spin a rod, and it duly starts to spin rapidly. She asks if it can spin the other rod, and it too spins round and round.So, is the activity ghosts? Lyn and Lindsay say what we've encountered cannot be easily explained away, and believe in the possibility of at least three spirits.  \nHayley Stevens, a writer for The Skeptic magazine and a researcher of paranormal activity for about 20 years, suggests not.She says involuntary muscle movements can cause dowsing rods to move.\"It's like why we close our eyes when we sneeze - things we don't do on purpose but our body does to respond to a situation,\" she says. \"I have this golden rule of ghost-hunting - if you have to touch something to allow the spirit to move it then it's you that's moving it.\"Hayley says spirit boxes might pick up frequencies used by radio stations or taxi offices, creating an \"audio illusion\".\"Humans are very good pattern-seekers and find meaning in the random,\" she says.Hayley adds: \"The power of expectation is always going to have a role here, and the power of suggestion.\"If you are told a lady haunts a location the chances are you are going to interpret sounds as being associated with that ghost.\"Both sceptic and believer could probably walk away from Starthpeffer satisfied.While we were packing up to leave there was a thud above us.The sound came from a vent where the attic is.An old building settling in the cool of the late afternoon, or a cheeky ghost saying \"cheerio\"?"]}

WHAT IS SPACESAIL?", "Several other Chinese outfits are also racing to launch their own megaconstellations—large pools of satellites that work together to deliver broadband internet access.", "A Chinese spacecraft with a three-person crew, including the country's first female space engineer, has docked after a journey of more than six hours.The crew will use the homegrown space station as a base for six months to conduct experiments and carry out spacewalks as Beijing gathers experience and intelligence for its eventual mission to put someone on the Moon by 2030.Beijing declared the launch of Shenzhou 19 a \"complete success\" - it is one of 100 launches China has planned in a record year of space exploration as it tries to outdo its rival, the United States. The BBC was given rare access to the Jiuquan Satellite launch centre in Gansu and we were just over a kilometre away when the spacecraft blasted off.\nFlames shot out of the rocket launcher as it took to the skies, lighting up the Gobi Desert with a deafening roar.Hundreds of people lined the streets, waving and cheering the names of the taikonauts, China’s word for astronauts, as they were sent off.At the Tiangong space station, the Shenzhou 19 crew met with three other astronauts who are manning the Shenzhou 18 and will return to Earth on 4 November.Just two years ago, President Xi Jinping declared that \"to explore the vast cosmos, develop the space industry and build China into a space power is our eternal dream”. But some in Washington see the country’s ambition and fast-paced progress as a real threat. Earlier this year, Nasa chief Bill Nelson said the US and China were “in effect, in a race” to return to the Moon, where he fears Beijing wants to stake territorial claims.He told legislators that he believed their civilian space programme was also a military programme.\nHowever, in Dongfeng Space City, a town built to support the launch site, China’s space programme is celebrated.Every street light is adorned with the national flag. Cartoon-like astronaut figurines and sculptures sit in the centre of children’s parks and plastic rockets are a centrepiece on most traffic roundabouts.A huge poster with Xi Jinping on one side and a photo of the Shenzhou spacecraft on the other greets you as you drive into the main compound.Hundreds have gathered in the dark after midnight to wave flags and brightly coloured lights as the Taikonauts make their last few steps on Earth before heading to the launch site.The brass band strikes up Ode to the Motherland as young children, kept up late for the occasion, their cheeks adorned with the Chinese flag, all shout in full song.This is a moment of national pride.The pilot of this mission, Cai Xuzhe, is a veteran but he’s travelling with a new generation of Chinese-trained taikonauts born in 1990 – including China’s first female space engineer, Wang Haoze.“Their youthful energy has made me feel younger and even more confident,” he told the gathered media ahead of take-off.“Inspired by dreams that spark glory, and by glory that ignites new dreams, we assure the party and the people that we will stay true to our mission, with our hearts and minds fully devoted. We will strive to achieve new accomplishments in China’s crewed space programme.”Standing to his left, beaming, is Song Lingdong. He recalls watching one of China’s first space station missions as a 13-year-old with “excitement and awe”. He chose to become a pilot in the hope that this is how he could serve his country.All three convey their deep sense of national pride, and state media has emphasised that this will be its “youngest crew” to date.The message is clear: this is a new generation of space travellers and an investment in the country’s future.China has already selected its next group of astronauts and they will train for potential lunar missions as well as to crew the space station.“I am determined not to let down the trust placed in me,” says Mr Song. “I will strive to make our country’s name shine once again in space.”\nChina’s name has been \"shining brightly\" a lot lately when it comes to headlines about its space programme.Earlier this year, the country achieved a historic first by retrieving rock and soil samples from the far side of the Moon.In 2021, China safely landed a spacecraft on Mars and released its Zhurong rover – becoming just the second nation to do so.China also has a fleet of satellites in space and has plans for many more.In August it launched the first 18 of what it hopes will eventually be a constellation of 14,000 satellites providing broadband internet coverage from space, which it hopes will one day rival SpaceX’s Starlink.Elon Musk, Starlink's chief executive, admitted on his own platform X that China’s space programme is far more advanced than people realise.But others in the US are voicing even greater concerns, as they fear this technology can be weaponised.The head of US Space Command, General Stephen Whiting, told a space symposium in April that China and Russia were both investing heavily in space at a “breath-taking speed”.He claimed that since 2018, China has tripled the amount of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance satellites it has in orbit, building a “kill web over the Pacific Ocean to find, fix, track and target United States and allied military capabilities”.\nChina’s space exploration is a “collective mission for humanity”, says Li Yingliang, director of the general technology bureau of China’s Manned Space Agency, dismissing US concerns as “unnecessary”.“I don’t think this should be called a competition… China has long upheld the notion of peaceful use of space in its manned space programme. In the future, we will further develop international co-operation in various aspects of manned space technology, all based on sharing and collaboration,” he adds.But the new space race is no longer about getting to the Moon. It’s about who will control its resources.The Moon contains minerals, including rare earths, metals like iron and titanium - and helium too, which is used in everything from superconductors to medical equipment.Estimates for the value of all this vary wildly, from billions to quadrillions. So it’s easy to see why some see the Moon as a place to make lots of money. However, it’s also important to note that this would be a very long-term investment - and the tech needed to extract and return these lunar resources is some way off, writes the BBC's science editor Rebecca Morelle. Chinese experts at the launch centre were keen to point out the benefits of Beijing’s space station experiments.“We study bones, muscles, nerve cells, and the effects of microgravity on them. Through this research, we’ve discovered that osteoporosis on Earth is actually similar to bone loss in space. If we can uncover unique patterns in space, we might be able to develop special medications to counteract bone loss and muscle atrophy,” said Zhang Wei, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.“Many of these experimental results can be applied on Earth.”China is, at times, trying to downplay its advances. At the launch of a roadmap for its space ambitions, which include building a research station on the Moon, returning samples of Venus’s atmosphere to Earth and launching more than 30 space missions by the middle of this century, Ding Chibiao from the Chinese Academy of Sciences said the country did not have a great number of achievements “compared to developed nations”.\nAnd even here at the launch centre, they admit to “significant challenges” as they try to land a crew on the Moon.“The technology is complex, there's a tight schedule, and there are a lot of challenges,” said Lin Xiqiang, spokesperson for the China Manned Space Agency.“We'll keep up the spirit of 'two bombs and one star'. We will maintain our self-confidence and commitment to self-improvement, keep working together and keep pushing forward. We'll make the Chinese people's dream of landing on the Moon a reality in the near future.”That’s perhaps why President Xi appears to be prioritising the country’s space programme even as the economy is in a slow decline.And even though they are bringing along international press to witness their progress – there are key restrictions.We were kept in a hotel three hours from the launch site and transported back and forth by bus, a total journey of 12 hours, rather than being left on site for a few hours.A simple trip to a friendly local restaurant was carefully guarded by a line of security personnel.We also noticed a large sign in town holds a stern warning: “It’s a crime to leak secrets. It’s an honour to keep secrets. You’ll be jailed if you leak secrets. You’ll be happy if you keep secrets. You’ll be shot if you sell secrets.”China is taking no chances with its new technology, as its rivalry with the United States is no longer just here on Earth. The world’s two most powerful countries could soon be staking territorial claims well beyond this planet."]}

If a celebrity guest agrees to be interviewed by the AI Sir Michael, that arguably removes the opportunity for a different interview which could have been conducted by a living journalist.\nParkinson said one of his motivations was to \"find a new, younger audience, one that possibly wasn’t aware of what my father could do\".\"It’s a wonderful way of extending the life of someone who was an outlier and a unique talent of his generation,\" he added.Explaining how the podcast would work, Anderson said: \"These are brand new interviews, and the AI we’ve created is as close to the late Sir Michael as we could possibly get it. \"He is autonomous, so we let him start the interview and after that it is up to AI Sir Michael, who is trained on Sir Michael’s style and the interview questions.He added: \"We can’t tell you the guests yet, we have a few slots remaining, but they are notable, noteworthy people.\"Sir Michael's TV career spanned seven decades, and he interviewed the world's biggest stars on his long-running chat show, which ran on the BBC and later ITV."]}

WordPress makes its source code open, which mean anyone can use it to create and redistribute their own tools for free.That's what WP Engine does to run a web hosting service.But in return for the source code, WordPress' boss, Matt Mullenweg, expects those who use it to contribute to its maintenance - for example by fixing bugs and testing new features.Mr Mullenweg accuses WP Engine of failing to do so, going so far as to call it \"a cancer to WordPress.\"As a result, in late September, he banned WP Engine from using key parts of WordPress.WP Engine rejects these claims.\"We are proud of our extensive contributions to the WordPress ecosystem,\" WP Engine wrote in a post on X/Twitter.\nCaught in the middle of this row are the countless websites and blogs that rely on the two companies' services.People like Tricia Fox, who uses a WP Engine subsidiary to host the websites her company serves.She now says she is \"almost certain\" to migrate her websites to a different host - a decision which she says is worth \"tens of thousands of pounds\" over the next few years.She wants to move away from WP Engine because the fallout has resulted in dozens of hours of extra work for her staff - increasing costs for her business.\"The team don't know if it's going to work today or not,\" Ms Fox told the BBC.But she worries even a costly move away from WP Engine may not solve her problems, as she would still be using another host based on the WordPress code.\"What's to stop WordPress from doing this again [to another company]?\" she asks.\"Right now we are currently focused on resolving our dispute with WP Engine,\" Automattic said when the BBC asked if it would go after other companies in a similar manner.\nThe row also underscores how important the open source principle is to the online economy.While big tech might attract the headlines, for many people and businesses it is something much less eye-catching that keeps them afloat.\"Open source is all about sharing code and standards so everyone benefits, and it’s a huge part of what makes the internet work,\" says Daniel Card.And with WordPress being such a big player in that world, if it makes changes to its tools, he adds, \"it’s felt by users everywhere and often impacts hosting, plugins, and web standards across the internet.\"\nWhile much of the spat between the two sides has taken place through official social media accounts and blog posts, it has also entered the courtroom.WordPress cannot force WP Engine to contribute to its open source project - but it does have control over its trademarks.It argues that WP Engine mentions WordPress in its marketing tools to help sell its product - and therefore should pay to use the trademark.\"Any business making hundreds of millions of dollars off of an open source project ought to give back, and if they don't, then they can’t use its trademarks,\" Mr Mullenweg wrote in a blog post.The trademarks do not cover the \"WP\" abbreviation, but the WordPress Foundation says: \"please don’t use it in a way that confuses people\".WP Engine has meanwhile filed a legal case against Mr Mullenweg and Automattic, with accusations of attempted extortion, libel and a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act among its complaints.It claims Automattic told WP Engine they would have to pay \"tens of millions of dollars\" in order to continue using the WordPress trademarks.WP Engine has since asked for the legal process to be sped up as its businesses are suffering.Its recent filing claimed the number of cancellation requests it receives have increased by 14% compared to normal trading, as a result of the disruption.It said it it is also losing out on potential new customers due to uncertainty over its future access to WordPress products.Automattic has called the lawsuit \"baseless\" and \"flawed, start to finish.\" \"We vehemently deny WP Engine’s allegations - which are gross mischaracterizations of reality,\" it said in a statement, adding that it would \"vigorously litigate against this absurd filing\"."]}

I was really struggling and my brain had completely given up.\"In her desperation - and also suffering with Covid while facing the deadlines - she said she turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to help her write one of the essays.Hannah, not her real name, is now warning others about the potential consequences of using generative AI to cheat at university.\nShe faced an academic misconduct panel, who have the power to expel students found to be cheating. Her case highlights the challenge that universities face as they encourage students to become AI literate, whilst discouraging cheating.Hannah's misuse of AI was discovered when her lecturer routinely scanned her essay using detection software. She said: \"My stomach was in knots and I was sitting outside the office. I was like 'this was really stupid'.\"“When it got flagged, me and my tutor were sat looking through it and he said you were doing really well up until this point, and then it all went down hill from there.“I’d been scored a zero and I then got an email from my tutor saying we think there’s been some academic misconduct.”\nHannah added: “I think in my head initially I thought, 'just deny it, don’t say anything', but then I saw on the screen an AI percentage and it was quite high and I just lasted three minutes before I broke down and said I had used AI to help me finish the essay.\"She was cleared as a panel ruled there wasn’t enough evidence against her, despite her having admitted using AI. Hannah said she thinks it was a slap on the wrist designed to serve as a warning to other students.\"I could have been kicked out,\" she said.“I do massively regret my choice, I was achieving really well, getting a lot of firsts, and I actually think that might have also been the problem, that I needed to maintain that level of grades, and it just kind of really pushed me into a place of using artificial intelligence.“The fact it was my first year, that’s probably also part of the reason why they decided they weren’t going to take it any further.“It felt really bad at the end of it, it really tainted that year for me.\"\nGenerative AI is technology that enables a computer to think or act in a more human way. It does this by taking in information from its surroundings, and deciding the best response based on what it learns.Universities have been trying to understand what AI applications are capable of and introduce guidance on how they can be used.\nSome universities ban the use of AI unless specifically authorised, while others allow AI to be used to identify errors in grammar or vocabulary, or permit generative AI content within assessments as long as it is fully cited and referenced. At a bar on the outskirts of Canterbury students here know the limits, and say they only use AI as an aid, like they might a search engine.A student called Taylor told us: \"You’ve got to embrace it. You can ask it questions and it helps you out. \"You can use it to create a guide to structure your work. It’s good for exam prep too.\"And fellow student Zyren said she fell out with a friend who used it extensively.\"They openly admitted to me they use AI, full on copied and pasted an essay they got from Chat GPT. A part of me felt annoyed as it hit me that they might get a higher score than me.”\nUniversities UK, an organisation of vice-chancellors and principals of universities, said: “Universities are aware of the potential risks posed by AI tools in the context of exams and assessment.\"[They] all have codes of conduct that include severe penalties for students found to be submitting work that is not their own, engaging with students from day-one on the implications of cheating and how it can be avoided.”\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \"Generative AI has great potential to transform the Higher Education sector and provides exciting opportunities for growth. However, integrating it into teaching, learning, and assessment will require careful consideration.“Universities must determine how to harness the benefits and mitigate the risks to prepare students for the jobs of the future.\""]}

I was really struggling and my brain had completely given up.\"In her desperation - and also suffering with Covid while facing the deadlines - she said she turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to help her write one of the essays.Hannah, not her real name, is now warning others about the potential consequences of using generative AI to cheat at university.\nShe faced an academic misconduct panel, who have the power to expel students found to be cheating. Her case highlights the challenge that universities face as they encourage students to become AI literate, whilst discouraging cheating.Hannah's misuse of AI was discovered when her lecturer routinely scanned her essay using detection software. She said: \"My stomach was in knots and I was sitting outside the office. I was like 'this was really stupid'.\"“When it got flagged, me and my tutor were sat looking through it and he said you were doing really well up until this point, and then it all went down hill from there.“I’d been scored a zero and I then got an email from my tutor saying we think there’s been some academic misconduct.”\nHannah added: “I think in my head initially I thought, 'just deny it, don’t say anything', but then I saw on the screen an AI percentage and it was quite high and I just lasted three minutes before I broke down and said I had used AI to help me finish the essay.\"She was cleared as a panel ruled there wasn’t enough evidence against her, despite her having admitted using AI. Hannah said she thinks it was a slap on the wrist designed to serve as a warning to other students.\"I could have been kicked out,\" she said.“I do massively regret my choice, I was achieving really well, getting a lot of firsts, and I actually think that might have also been the problem, that I needed to maintain that level of grades, and it just kind of really pushed me into a place of using artificial intelligence.“The fact it was my first year, that’s probably also part of the reason why they decided they weren’t going to take it any further.“It felt really bad at the end of it, it really tainted that year for me.\"\nGenerative AI is technology that enables a computer to think or act in a more human way. It does this by taking in information from its surroundings, and deciding the best response based on what it learns.Universities have been trying to understand what AI applications are capable of and introduce guidance on how they can be used.\nSome universities ban the use of AI unless specifically authorised, while others allow AI to be used to identify errors in grammar or vocabulary, or permit generative AI content within assessments as long as it is fully cited and referenced. At a bar on the outskirts of Canterbury students here know the limits, and say they only use AI as an aid, like they might a search engine.A student called Taylor told us: \"You’ve got to embrace it. You can ask it questions and it helps you out. \"You can use it to create a guide to structure your work. It’s good for exam prep too.\"And fellow student Zyren said she fell out with a friend who used it extensively.\"They openly admitted to me they use AI, full on copied and pasted an essay they got from Chat GPT. A part of me felt annoyed as it hit me that they might get a higher score than me.”\nUniversities UK, an organisation of vice-chancellors and principals of universities, said: “Universities are aware of the potential risks posed by AI tools in the context of exams and assessment.\"[They] all have codes of conduct that include severe penalties for students found to be submitting work that is not their own, engaging with students from day-one on the implications of cheating and how it can be avoided.”\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \"Generative AI has great potential to transform the Higher Education sector and provides exciting opportunities for growth. However, integrating it into teaching, learning, and assessment will require careful consideration.“Universities must determine how to harness the benefits and mitigate the risks to prepare students for the jobs of the future.\""]}

Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson (NF). This book was especially interesting given how much Elon has been front and center in the news this year.", "Zander Mundy was midway through a typical day at his office when he heard the news: tech billionaire Elon Musk was speaking at a nearby school in the town of Folsom, in the US state of Pennsylvania. \"When is the richest guy in the world in town often?\" Mr Mundy remembers thinking to himself. With a population of just under 9,000 people, Folsom is a quiet place. Residents typically shy away from speaking openly about their politics, and political yard signs are few and far between. The 21-year-old Mr Mundy, who works at a leasing agent at an apartment complex, admits that he wasn't planning on voting in the November election. But once he saw crowds forming - and felt the excitement - he decided to go in, eager to hear from Musk. By the time he left the school, he recalls leaning more towards Donald Trump than towards Kamala Harris. \"[If] someone like that tells you this is the election that's going to decide our future, not only who's president for the next four years but what the world world is going to be like... I think that's pretty huge,\" he told the BBC. \"That matters. That's significant.\" Musk, who previously cultivated an image as an eccentric tech genius who was only on the sidelines of politics, has now pledged full allegiance to Trump. In full view of the American public, the 53-year-old has invested his time, operational know-how and ample pocketbook into trying to get the Republican elected - a rarity among the nation's business elite who traditionally prefer to influence politics from behind the scenes.It's an approach that is starkly different to traditional CEOs, many of whom have been better known for holding expensive, exclusive fundraising dinners or hosting potential donors at lavish homes in the Hamptons. And it's prompted observers to ask questions about Mr Musk's motivations.Follow live updates from the US campaign trailElection polls - is Harris or Trump ahead?The traditional approach by CEOs is \"not out in the public spotlight,\" explains Erik Gordon, chair of the entrepreneurship department at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. But \"Musk does it loudly and proudly, and, therefore, perhaps makes himself a lightning rod\". Musk's Trump-supporting political action committee - America PAC - has already spent more than $119m (£91.6m) this election cycle, according to Open Secrets, a non-profit tracker. Additionally, Musk's own contributions make him one of the largest individual donors in the presidential race, and reportedly play a vital role in Trump's door-knocking and ground operation in key swing states in which the campaign hopes to mobilise voters. Steve Davis, a key lieutenant of Musk's who has worked for his companies including SpaceX, X and the Boring Company, has reportedly been recruited to help in the effort. \nMr Musk's personal investment into the campaign is something that was quickly noticed by Mr Mundy. \"That alone was shocking to me,\" he said. \"That someone would really spend that much time and money to influence voters. That means he's doing it for a reason.\" Some Democrats, like Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, have been urging their party to not ignore the threat Mr Musk poses ahead of the election. Mr Musk appeals to a demographic of people who see him as \"undeniably brilliant\" and among whom traditional Democratic outreach efforts have proven difficult, Fetterman believes. Why Trump is courting old friends from the WWEAre Elon Musk's election giveaways legal?Since first endorsing Trump in the wake of the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, on 13 July, Mr Musk has become a common fixture on the campaign trail, where he often delivers warnings that only Trump can \"save\" American democracy. In the closing days of the race, Mr Musk has criss-crossed the state of Pennsylvania, a key battleground state that has become a focus for Trump and Kamala Harris alike. America PAC is now doling out $1m a day until election day to one random voter - no matter their party affiliation - provided they have registered to vote and sign a petition. At \"town hall\" events in Harrisburg and Pittsburgh over the weekend, for example, Mr Musk presented giant lottery-style cheques to winners, with enthusiastic crowds chanting \"Elon\". He responded by telling the crowd that their energy \"lights a fire\" in his soul.At a rally in Philadelphia on Monday, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Mr Musk was “dangling a million bucks to many of us who are struggling to make ends meet, if they dance for him\".“Elon Musk thinks that dangling money in front of a working person is a cute thing to do when the election of our lives is before us because that’s what people and billionaires like that do,\" she added.Some observers, however, have questioned his motivation and have suggested that Mr Musk and his businesses stand to benefit from a relationship with Trump. Among those observers is Matt Teske, the CEO of electric vehicle charging platform Chargeway. According to Mr Teske, Mr Musk's political shift has been difficult for many in the electric vehicle industry, but comes as no surprise after several years of becoming increasingly active in politics. \"I think Musk's interests are focused, predominantly, around a handful of things that are important to him related to his businesses, [with] regulation being something he's voiced concerns around,\" Mr Teske says.

Mr Musk, for his part, has said he would be open to the idea of leading a \"department of government efficiency\" to end regulation's \"strangulation\" of the US. That position, Democrats say, could present a complex conflict of interest, given the billions in government contracts Mr Musk has received for SpaceX and Tesla. \"That's kind of deeply both unethical and illegal,\" says Lenny Mendonca, California Governor Gavin Newsom's former chief economic and business adviser.

Mr Noble believes that this form of campaigning should concern Americans who value safe work environments and consumer protections. “We know what companies do when left to their own devices.

So can Londoners do this - and is it such an issue if they don't?\nCampaigners say the materials and chemicals used to make vapes - including their lithium batteries - make them difficult to dispose of safely.Refillable vapes and e-cigarettes allow you to remove and recycle the battery,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) said.This is harder with disposable vapes because the lithium batteries are inside the enclosed casing of the vape itself, so unable to be removed easily.One recycling facility previously told BBC London it dismantles them, then crushes the battery into fine powders for re-use.Research published in 2023 by not-for-profit organisation Material Focus suggested only 17% of disposable vape recycle - and an estimated five million disposable vapes are thrown away each week in the UK.\nThe LFB said: \"Lithium batteries and electricals with hidden lithium batteries should not be placed in the same bins as your regular rubbish or recycling.\"There is a risk of the battery exploding and catching fire if it has been damaged.Fires at landfill sites have been caused when batteries have been thrown away in household bins, compacted in waste lorries, or are stored in landfill. The LFB said these battery-started fires are \"time consuming, and require a high level of resources\" to put out.\nMany retailers offer take-back services for disposable vapes where you can drop their vapes into a special bin in store.You can check your postcode to find recycling points in shops near you, such as Material Focus' Recycle Your Electricals website and the London Recycles scheme.Some councils also have recycling points at household recycling centres across London boroughs, but you should visit your local council's website to check whether this service is available in your area.\nIn 2022, London Mayor Sadiq Khan told London Assembly Members the ReLondon partnership was working to increase access to vape recycling in flats by including waste bins for small electricals in some communal bin stores, which he said resulted in a reduction of these items in residual waste.More widely, the previous Conservative government announced changes to the rules around vapes, including a ban on disposable vapes, to be introduced in April 2025.This would effectively eliminate the issue of recycling legally purchased disposable vapes, as they would no longer be able to be sold.However, this Tobacco and Vapes Bill had not become law before parliament was dissolved ahead of the July general election - and the new Labour government said it would introduce its own Tobacco and Vapes Bill.Details of the bill were set out in this year's King Speech but it did not mention a ban on disposable vapes.BBC London has been told ministers from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs are reviewing proposals to restrict the sale and supply of disposable vapes before setting out their next steps.In the meantime, safety experts and council workers continue to urge vapers in the capital to recycle disposable vapes safely, rather than binning them.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

As would other African countries in general. “Only Africa understands her own needs,” says Ms Kimani.\nCurrently, many African nations with young space programmes are dependent on foreign technology and experts, says Temidayo Oniosun, managing director of Space in Africa, a market research and consulting company.Some countries have sent students and engineers abroad to pick up space tech know-how. “The problem is, when these guys come back, there is no laboratory, no facility for them,” says Mr Oniosun.Senegal’s new satellite was built by Senegalese technicians. While not wanting to detract from their significant achievement, it is worth noting that development of the satellite was made possible through a partnership with a French university, and that the spacecraft was launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from California.\nEurope, China and the US have all involved themselves in numerous African space programmes. This has helped boost African technology into orbit, for sure, but it has also served as a “critical diplomatic tool”, says Mr Oniosun.

Dr Klinger notes that space launches from equatorial regions – which may not require as much fuel – could mean that African space ports have an important role to play in the coming decades.The Luigi Broglio Space Center, an old Italian-built space port including a sea platform off the coast of Kenya, could be brought back into service one day, for example. The last launches there took place in the 1980s.Ultimately, we can expect to see rising activity in space from African nations. “We’ve got close to 80 satellites that are currently in development,” says Mr Oniosun, “I think the future of the industry is very bright.”"]}

{"id": 333, "question": "What is one of the main concerns about the environmental impact of rocket launches, according to Dr. Eloise Marais?", "answer": ["One of the main concerns is the emission of black carbon, which is released much higher into the atmosphere than emissions from planes and can last much longer."], "doc": ["Eloise Marais, professor of Physical Geography at the University College London, predicted that in order to consider harmful environmental impacts, launches would need to exceed 100 launches per year.[8] Rocket launches would not need to increase much from current levels to potentially induce harmful effects.", "Even while the current amount of greenhouse gases emitted by rockets is relatively low, it may be important to take note of these potential impacts as the industry continues to grow.[34] B.

Dr.", "Marais and a team of researchers from University College London (UCL), the University of Cambridge and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used a 3D model to explore the impact on the atmosphere of rocket launches and re-entry in 2019, and the future impact of space tourism promoted by companies like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin.", "Elon Musk’s Starship rocket has completed a world first after part of it was captured on its return to the launch pad.The SpaceX vehicle's lower half manoeuvred back beside its launch tower where it was caught in a giant pair of mechanical arms, as part of its fifth test flight.It brings SpaceX’s ambition of developing a fully reusable and rapidly deployable rocket a big step closer.\"A day for the history books,\" engineers at SpaceX declared as the booster landed safely.\nThe chances of the bottom part of the rocket, known as the Super Heavy booster, being caught so cleanly on the first attempt seemed slim. Prior to the launch, the SpaceX team said it would not be surprised if the booster was instead directed to land in the Gulf of Mexico. \nSpaceX can now point to some extraordinary achievements in the past two test flights. This comes only eighteen months after its inaugural flight, which saw the vehicle blown apart not long after launch. SpaceX argues that these failures are also part of its development plan - to launch early in the expectation of failure so that it can collect as much data as possible and develop its systems quicker than its rivals. The initial stages of the ascent of the fifth test were the same as the previous outing, with the Ship and booster separating two and three-quarter minutes after leaving the ground.At this point the booster began to head back towards the launch site at Boca Chica in Texas.With just two minutes to go till landing it was still not clear if the attempt would be made, as final checks were carried out by the team operating the tower.\nWhen the flight director gave the go-ahead, cheers went up from SpaceX employees at mission control.The company had said that thousands of criteria had to be met for the attempt to be made.As the Super Heavy booster re-entered the atmosphere it slowed down from speeds in excess of a few thousands miles per hour.When it approached the landing tower, which stands 146m-high (480ft), its raptor engines worked to control its landing. It seemed to almost float, orange flames engulfed the booster and it deftly slotted into the giant mechanical arms. \nThe Ship part of the rocket, which is where equipment and crew will eventually be held for future missions, fired up its own engines after separating from the booster.It was successfully landed in the Indian Ocean around forty minutes later. \"Ship landed precisely on target! Second of the two objectives achieved\", SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote on X.Not only was the Ship landed accurately but SpaceX also managed to preserve some of the vehicle's hardware, which it had not expected.\nCatching the booster rather than getting it to land on the launch pad reduces the need for complex hardware on the ground and will enable rapid redeployment of the vehicle in the future.Elon Musk and SpaceX have grand designs that the rocket system will one day take humans to the Moon, and then on to Mars, making our species \"multi-planetary\".The US space agency, Nasa, will also be delighted the flight has gone to plan. It has paid the company $2.8bn (£2.14bn) to develop Starship into a lander capable of returning astronauts to the Moon's surface by 2026. In space terms that is not that far away so Elon Musk's team were eager to get the rocket re-launched as soon as possible.But the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) , the US government body that approves all flights, had previously said there would be no launch before November as it reviewed the company's permits. Since last month the agency and Elon Musk have been in a public spat after the FAA said it was seeking to fine his company, SpaceX, $633,000 for allegedly failing to follow its license conditions and not getting permits for previous flights.Before issuing a license, the FAA reviews the impact of the flight, in particular the effect on the environment.In response to the fine, Musk threatened to sue the agency and SpaceX put out a public blog post hitting back against \"false reporting\" that part of the rocket was polluting the environment.Currently the FAA only considers the impact on the immediate environment from rocket launches rather than the wider impacts of the emissions. Dr Eloise Marais, professor of atmospheric chemistry and air quality at University College London, said the carbon emissions from rockets pale in comparison to other forms of transport but there are other planet-warming pollutants which are not being considered.\"The black carbon is one of the biggest concerns. The Starship rocket is using liquid methane. It's a relatively new propellant, and we don't have very good data of the amount of emissions that are coming from liquid methane,\" she said.Dr Marais said what makes black carbon from rockets so concerning is that they release it hundreds of miles higher into the atmosphere than planes, where it can last much longer."]}

The electronic line call can overrule the human eye. Therefore, why do we need the line judge to make a call at all?\"Of course, even before Wimbledon's announcement this week, technology played a big part at the tournament through Hawk-Eye, the ball-tracking system, and organisers are following the example set by others.It was announced last year that the ATP tour would replace the human line judge with an electronic system from 2025. The US Open and the Australian Open have also scrapped them. The French Open will be the only major tournament left with human line judges. \nAs the BBC's tennis correspondent Russell Fuller outlined, players will intermittently complain about electronic line calling, but there has been consensus for a while that the technology is now more accurate and consistent than a human.Mr Bayliss acknowledges there is a \"high degree of trust in the electronic line calling\".He points out: \"The only frustration the player can show is at themselves for not winning the point.\"\nWhether the tech works is one thing - but whether it's worth it is another.Dr Anna Fitzpatrick, who played at Wimbledon between 2007 and 2013, says her \"first feeling on hearing the news about the Wimbledon line judges was of sadness\".\"A human element of sport is one of the things that draws us in,\" the lecturer in sports performance and analysis at Loughborough University tells the BBC.While she recognises technology can improve the performance of athletes, she hopes we always keep it in check.Of course, tennis is far from alone in its embrace of tech. \nCricket is another sport where it plays a big role and - according to Dr Tom Webb, an expert in the officiating of sport at Coventry University - it has been driven by broadcasters.He says that as soon as televised coverage showed sporting moments in a way that an umpire couldn't see, it led to calls for change in the game.  \"I think we need to be careful,\" he tells the BBC.In particular, he says, we need to think carefully about what aspect of human decision-making is automated.He argues that in football, goal-line technology has been accepted because, like electronic line calls in tennis, it is a measurement - it's either a goal or it's not.However, many people are frustrated with the video assistant referee (VAR) system, with decisions taking too long and fans in the stadium not being aware of what is happening.\"The issue with VAR is it's not necessarily relying on how accurate the technology is. It's still reliant on individual judgment and subjectivity, and how you interpret the laws of the game,\" he adds.\nOf course, there is a temptation to think of technology as something new in sport.Anything but, according to Prof Steve Haake of Sheffield Hallam University, who says sport has always evolved with the innovations of the day, with even the Greeks adapting the sprint race in the ancient Olympics.\"Right back from the very start of sports, it was a spectacle, but we also wanted it to be fair. \"That's what these technologies are about. That's the trick that we've got to get right.\"Technology is still adding to the spectacle of sport - think of the 360-degree swirling photography used to illustrate the dramatic conclusion to the men's 100m final at this summer's Olympics.And while it is true that some traditional jobs, like line judges, may be disappearing, tech is also fuelling the creation of other jobs - particularly when it comes to data.Take the example of sports analysis system Opta, which allows both athletes and fans to have streams of data to measure performance, a process which artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating.While it might not be the same as a tennis player's emotional outburst at a line judge, its advocates argue it allows a more intense connection of its own kind, as people are able to learn ever more about the sports and players they love.And, of course, the frequent controversies over systems like VAR bring plenty of scope for tech to get the heart pumping.\"People love sport because of the drama,\" says Patrick Lucey, chief scientist of Stats Perform, the company behind Opta.\"Technology is kind of making it stronger.\""]}

Attempts to revolutionize tennis officiating and the judging of calls in the sport began in the early 1970s and has resulted in the design, development and prototyping of several computerized, electronic line-judge devices.", "Tennis won’t have this issue, but its highly fragmented infrastructure is likely to create disparities in how and when video review is used from tournament to tournament. Even now, the four Grand Slams take different approaches to umpiring and the use of Hawk-Eye, from fully electronic line calling at the U.S.", "“We understand the reasons behind the decision to introduce live electronic line-calling and we recognise the ongoing changes to officiating around the world,” said the LTA in a statement.", "From 2025 onwards live electronic line calling (ELC) will be used on all courts in both the main draw at the All England Club and the qualifying tournament off-site in Roehampton. The new technology was successfully tested during this year’s championships.", "\"The drama of a player shouting and making a challenge, and the crowd watching the screen and waiting for Hawk-Eye to make a decision, all of that drama is now lost.\"David Bayliss is describing a scene he saw play out many times as a Wimbledon line judge - and one which the Championships won't witness again.Just as with the many other sports that have embraced technology, the All England Club is waving goodbye to human line judges from next summer, after 147 years, in the name of \"maximum accuracy\".But does this risk minimising the drama Mr Bayliss fondly remembers being involved in - and which so many of us love watching?\n\"It is sad that we won’t be going back as line judges,\" he says. \"The game has moved on, but never say never.\"He served as a line judge and umpire at Wimbledon for 22 years, calling the lines when Roger Federer won his first Grand Slam, in 2003. Being hit by the ball at over 100mph is, he jokes, \"quite sore\".While he's sad to see line judges go, he says it's hard to argue with the logic.\"Essentially, we have a human being and technology calling the same line. The electronic line call can overrule the human eye.

SpaceX has developed technologies over the last decade to facilitate full and rapid reuse of space launch vehicles.", "[13] The rocket has been designed with the goal of being fully reusable to reduce launch costs;[14] it consists of the Super Heavy first-stage booster and the Starship spacecraft[15] which are powered by Raptor and Raptor Vacuum engines.", "For the first time ever, SpaceX successfully manoeuvred the bottom part of the vehicle, the Super Heavy booster, back to the launch pad. Once there, it hovered before being captured mid-air by a pair of giant mechanical arms on the launch tower.", "Elon Musk wants his new rocket to revolutionise spaceflight. And that rocket, Starship, is now the largest and most powerful spacecraft ever built.It’s also designed to be fully and rapidly reusable. His private company SpaceX, which is behind the creation, is hoping to develop a spaceship that can be used more like a plane than a traditional rocket system, being able to land, refuel and take off again a few hours after landing.\nStarship's fifth test flight on 13 October was its most successful.For the first time ever, SpaceX successfully manoeuvred the bottom part of the vehicle, the Super Heavy booster, back to the launch pad. Once there, it hovered before being captured mid-air by a pair of giant mechanical arms on the launch tower.SpaceX wants its spacecraft to be rapidly reusable, and the quickest way to achieve that is to bring the rocket's components back to where they started.SpaceX wants eventually to catch the Ship - the top part of the vehicle - in the same way. But that didn't happen on the fifth test flight, instead it landed exactly as planned in the Indian Ocean. \nNone of Starship's missions so far have been crewed, and there's no plans to put people aboard for the next flight either. But Musk and his company do have grand designs that the rocket system will one day take humanity to Mars. A Mars trip isn't on the horizon just yet. But the behemoth rocket already has some impressive specs, and dwarfs all of its predecessors.\nStarship is a two-stage vehicle. The “Ship” is the uppermost part, and that sits atop a booster called Super Heavy.Thirty-three engines at the base of this booster produce around 74 meganewtons of thrust. To put that into perspective, it’s almost 700 times as powerful as the thrust generated by the common passenger plane, the Airbus A320neo.If you’ve flown with Aer Lingus, British Airways or Lufthansa, imagine the kick of taking off in one of those planes. Then multiply that by 700.The vehicle has grown about a metre since its second test flight in June of this year, with Starship now measuring just over 120m in total. This additional height comes from the Super Heavy booster itself being made 1m longer.\nIt's also about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rocket which first took humanity to the Moon's surface. SpaceX says that power should be able to move a payload weighing at least 150 tonnes from the launchpad to low-Earth orbit.\nBoth the Ship and the Super Heavy booster are fuelled with a mixture of icy-cold liquid methane and liquid oxygen fuel, known as methalox.\nStarship has had four test flights up to now. During the first flight, the rocket system exploded early, before the Booster was able to separate. It's worth noting that such hiccups are part of SpaceX's plan to speed up development by launching systems they know are not perfect and learning from the faults. And each test has seen real progress - first with a hitch-free separation, and eventually a successful return, where both the Ship and the Booster made a controlled descent and hovered above the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Mexico respectively until splashing down. \nAnyone watching nearby as the booster returns to Earth can expect a thunderous boom as it slows down from supersonic speeds.While SpaceX plan to catch the booster with the launch tower, we won’t get a similar return of the top part – the Ship – this time. When we do, it shouldn't look too different from the Super Heavy’s descent.But since there's no launch tower on Mars, or on the Moon for that matter, the Ship also needs to be able to land on its legs. To do that, it manoeuvres itself horizontally as it starts to descend, in what Musk has called a 'belly-flop' manoeuvre. This increases the drag on the vehicle, slowing it down.\nOnce the Ship gets close enough to the surface, it’s then slow enough to fire its engines in a way that flips the vehicle into a vertical position.The Ship then uses its rockets to guide itself down safely and land on a hard pad upon its landing legs.All of this has been done by the Ship on its previous flight - apart from landing on a pad. So far it has only landed in the sea. \nOne of the purposes of test flying is to highlight problem areas, and the quick turnaround between each test flight means that weak links have to be redesigned at lightning speed. If you get one thing wrong, the entire internal structure of the rocket could be melted by hot gases.\nThere are a few things Starship could be used for soon.So far Musk has used his own rockets, like the Falcon 9 series, to launch his own commercial satellites, known as Starlink.Those satellites have a short lifespan of around five years, and the flock in orbit needs to be constantly replenished just to keep the same number of satellites in space.\nNasa also wants to use Starship as part of its Artemis programme, which aims to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon.\nIn the more distant future, Musk wants Starship to make long-haul trips to Mars and back – about a nine month trip each way.“You could conceivably have five or six people per cabin, if you really wanted to crowd people in. But I think mostly we would expect to see two or three people per cabin, and so nominally about 100 people per flight to Mars,” Musk said.The idea is to send the Ship part of the vehicle into low-Earth orbit, and “park” it there. It could then be refuelled in orbit by a SpaceX 'tanker' - essentially another Ship without the windows -  for its onward journey to Mars.It’s also conceivable that Starship could be used to launch space telescopes.The Hubble telescope is about the size of a bus, and the James Webb telescope is almost three times as big as that.To put up thousands of satellites quickly, or a bigger telescope, you need a big rocket.Finally, Starship has also been built to carry heavy loads needed to build space stations, and eventually, infrastructure for a human presence on the Moon. \nA rocket that kicks 700 times harder than a passenger jet is bound to have some impact on the environment.A draft environmental report by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) released in July shows that the new licence SpaceX is applying for would allow them 25 launches of Starship per year.The FAA say this would emit a total of 97,342 tonnes of CO2 equivalent - or 3,894 tonnes per launch.In comparison, a typical car in the US emits about 4.6 tonnes of CO2 per year, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.If we crunch the numbers, that means one launch of Starship emits as much greenhouse gas as 846 cars would emit over the course of a year.From a sheer numerical standpoint, that's fairly insignificant compared to say, the commercial aviation industry.But with Musk hoping to increase the number of launches to potentially hundreds per year in the future, those numbers could start adding up."]}

Dr Massey advised people to \"wrap up\" and bring a hot drink with them.\"Just go out, enjoy it, don't sweat it,\" he said.The RAS said the comet was first visible in the southern hemisphere between 27 September and 2 October and would be visible from Saturday night to 30 October.The comet likely travelled from the outer reaches of our solar system and made its closest transit past the sun on 27 September, the Nasa Earth Observatory said.Dr Massey said the nucleus of the comet - its solid core - has been estimated to be 2km (1.24 miles) long, or \"mountain-size\".He said he tried to spot it on Friday night and will \"certainly try again\".\"Sometimes comets disappoint... but this one appears to be acting in line with predictions,\" he said.\"We want people to try and go out and have a look.\"\nComet A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) was photographed in Spain, Italy, Uruguay, and Indonesia between 29 September and 1 October.Dr Massey advised using a DSLR camera to capture the comet, but said holding a mobile phone camera up against the eyepiece of a small telescope could snap the space event too.On the RAS's website, he said: \"And if it’s genuinely easy to spot, you might, might be able to pick up your mobile phone, rest on something, and just point and shoot.\"The comet follows the UK's skies being splashed with colour from the Northern Lights overnight on Thursday.The lights, also known as aurora borealis, were expected to be seen only as far south as the Midlands, but the spectacle was visible from the top of the UK in the Shetland Islands down to London.Is there a link between the comet and the Northern Lights?\"It's a nice coincidence,\" Dr Massey said."]}

So, which city invented tortellini – Bologna, Modena or Castelfranco Emilia?", "For centuries, residents of Emilia-Romagna have disagreed about which of its two main cities invented tortellini, but the truth may be neither did.\nI'm seated at the three-Michelin starred Osteria Francescana, and can't believe my luck. It's been eight years since I first attempted to snag a reservation at the coveted restaurant in Modena, Italy, helmed by Massimo Bottura, one of the world's most influential chefs. I've been to Italy nearly 50 times since 2016, and each visit, I prowl the restaurant's website, even setting alarms at odd hours, to no avail.\nBut one week ago, from my hotel in Tuscany, I saw a 12:30 lunch cancellation and pounced. And now I'm finally here, in a world of chic Gucci wallpaper and dim lighting, about to try the famous 15-course tasting menu for myself.\nI'm savouring \"Tortellini or Dumplings?\" – a Korean spin on tortellini in brodo (tortellini soup) where Osteria Francescana serves twisted dumplings in seaweed stock instead of traditional capon broth – when Bottura himself walks in. The desire to eat at one of the world's best restaurants is what initially piqued my interest in this place, but what brought me here tonight is the delicious bite on my spoon: tortellini.\nTortellini – a circular-shaped pasta, twisted around a filling of mortadella, prosciutto, pork loin and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese – are the quintessential pasta varietal here in Italy's hilly Emilia-Romagna region. But while there is no question that tortellini hails from Emilia-Romagna, scholars, chefs and locals have bickered for centuries about which of the region's two rival medieval powerhouses can lay claim to the honour: Modena or Bologna?\nI am sure Bottura knows; he's not only from Modena, but is also famed for his innovative tortellini dishes, inspired by childhood memories of sitting under his grandmother's table as she prepared the meaty morsels. As he stops to greet me, I asked him where tortellini were invented: Modena or Bologna?\n\"Neither,\" he says, his arms sprawling as wide as his smile. \"It's Castelfranco Emilia.\"\nHis answer stops me mid-bite. Castelfranco Emilia is a small town located between Modena and Bologna. It is indeed famous for its sfogline (pasta makers), but this was the first I'd heard of its connection to tortellini. I left Osteria Francescana with more questions than answers.\nThe \"Modena-versus-Bologna\" tortellini debate had intrigued me ever since visiting the Palazzo Comunale di Modena; home to the Stolen Bucket. This was where I first learned that Modena and Bologna's feud goes back to the Middle Ages when the cities were entwined in a bitter religious rivalry that lasted more than 300 years (Modena supported the Holy Roman Empire; Bologna supported the Popes). In 1325, during one of the war's skirmishes, Modenese soldiers stole a bucket from a city well in Bologna; a war trophy.\nWhat follows next is delicious myth: in 1622, Modenese poet Alessandro Tassoni wrote La Secchia Rapita (The Stolen Bucket), a parody of the events where the Olympic gods descend to aid in the fight; Apollo and Minerva sided with Bologna, while Mars, Venus and Bacchus sided with Modena.\nThen, in the late 19th Century, Italian poet Giuseppe Ceri nodded to Tassoni and the medieval-era Modena-Bologna-bucket conflict in his own poem, The Bellybutton of Venus, writing that after the gods came down to intervene, they took a detour to Castelfranco Emilia. The fateful side trip results in tortellini.\nThere are a few variations of the myth, but the most popular version goes like this: Venus, Bacchus and Mars walk into an inn in Castelfranco Emilia. The following morning, Venus is sleeping naked and alone, and the innkeeper, infatuated with her beauty, peeps through the keyhole and sees her exposed belly button. Inspired by its shape, he creates tortellini.\nWhat's unclear is whether there is any historical truth that led Ceri to set this scene in Castelfranco Emilia. Centuries earlier, sometime between 1688 and 1690, the priest and historian Ludovico Antonio Muratori wrote that he ate minestra di tortellini (tortellini soup) in Castelfranco Emilia. It may be impossible to prove that tortellini were in fact native to that city (or that Ceri had ever read the account), but today in Castelfranco Emilia, there is a statue of the innkeeper peeping through the keyhole to see Venus' belly button.\nHungrier than ever for the truth after my encounter with Bottura, I reached out to a series of local chefs to get to the bottom of the matter and found that many people today – even the region of Emilia-Romagna's website – embrace Castelfranco Emilia's role as the mythical birthplace of tortellini.\n\"The idea of [tortellini] was born in a small village, Castelfranco Emilia, in between Bologna and Modena,\" said chef Aurora Mazzucchelli of Casa Mazzucchelli, a Michelin-star restaurant in Sasso Marconi, a province of Bologna, when I asked her where tortellini were invented.\n\"The debate has been settled,\" said chef Ottavio Gnazzo, the chef de cuisine at Rezdôra, a New York restaurant serving Emilia-Romagnan cuisine helmed by Bottura mentee chef Stefano Secchi. \"We know tortellini comes from Castelfranco Emilia.\" \nHowever, despite the general consensus that Castelfranco Emilia is the beloved pasta's birthplace, there is still some speculation.\n\"We are sure that tortellini come from Bologna,\" said Monica Venturi of Bologna's Le Sfogline. Venturi grew up in Bologna, where her family has been running the small handmade pasta shop since 1996.  \"When tortellini were made for the first time, Castelfranco Emilia was under Bologna.\"\nSecchi himself doesn't necessarily disagree but adds context. \"The issue is that tortellini were first made in Castelfranco Emilia. [We know of] the legend of Venus's bellybutton, but Castelfranco Emilia has been a province of both Modena and Bologna, so [it] will be tough to ultimately decide.\"\nIts exact geographical origins aren't the only dispute surrounding this stuffed pasta. In Bologna, tortellini are often much smaller than tortellini from Modena and Castelfranco Emilia; called tortellini al mignolo (pinky finger tortellini). And, \"In Bologna, we normally use raw filling, while in Modena, they normally use cooked [browned in butter] filling,\" added Mazzucchelli. \"I personally like raw stuffing because it allows me to work with a more solid texture.\"\nBack in Modena, Francesco Vincenzi is head chef of Franceschetta58, a casual bistro opened by Bottura that serves bold, modern Modenese cuisine, so Vincenzi has a different take on the recipe.\n\"Our tortellini filling is not quite blanched, not quite cooked, but in between,\" he said.\nTraditionally, tortellini are served in brodo (broth) or panna (heavy cream) but restaurants like Francescetta58 are serving them in a decadent Parmigiano cream instead; a shock to tortellini purists.\n\"I don't like when they try to change the recipe of this type of tradition,\" Venturi said. \"Tortellini must be cooked in the broth, boiled and then eaten with the broth.\"\nFillings, cities and regional variations aside, there is one factor that Emilia-Romagnans generally agree on: making tortellini is a family affair. The task is largely attributed to the rezdôra, or the \"head of the household\", in Modenese dialect, which refers to the women who roll out pasta by hand.\nGnazzo, who was born in the US but raised in Italy, grew up in the kitchen watching his father; also a chef. He reflected on watching rezdôre in Bologna for the first time.\n\"They're masters at making pasta, so when I went to Bologna and saw them making tortellini, I bought some, and we made it there; the right way in capon stock,\" he said.\nMazzucchelli has fond early memories of tortellini, too. \"I used to make tortellini with my mom and dad. It was a significant moment around the table to help pinch shut the tortellini.\"\nTortellini are Emilia-Romagnan culture at its core, commonly enjoyed in celebration around Christmas time and the Feast of Saint Stephen (Boxing Day). The circular-shaped pasta is so tied to the region that La San Nicola Association hosts an annual Tortellini Festival (Sagra del Tortellino) in Castelfranco Emilia during the second week of September. The festival lasts one week, with each night featuring a tortellini dish from a restaurant in the region. On the final night, there's a live performance that reenacts the innkeeper peeping through the keyhole.   \nAs evidenced by his \"Tortellini or Dumplings?\" and \"Tortellini Walking on Broth\" dishes, Bottura has no qualms about reinventing the beloved pasta. But to ensure that tortellini tradition isn't lost, Bottura and his wife and business partner Lara Gilmore opened Tortellante, a cooking school in Modena where elderly women teach young adults with autism how to make tortellini.\nSo, which city invented tortellini – Bologna, Modena or Castelfranco Emilia? The world may never know for sure, but one thing is certain: tortellini is one of the most defining foods of the Emilia-Romagna region.\nAs Bottura enthusiastically told me, \"Even if you don't believe in God, you can believe in tortellini.\"\nRecipe for tortellini\nby Chef Ottavio Gnazzo on behalf of Rezdôra\nMethod\nStep 1\nIn a tabletop mixer, add the flour and make a well. In a small bowl, mix the eggs with the olive oil, then add the mixture to the mixer. Mix the dough on low speed for 10 minutes, pat into a flat disc or ball and wrap with plastic wrap. Leave at room temperature until ready to roll out.\nStep 2\nAdd all the meats to a grinder on fine die setting and grind together. Transfer the meat mixture to a small bowl, then mix in the nutmeg, sea salt, Parmigiano and eggs to create a paste.\nStep 3\nRoll out the dough into a sheet to the last setting on the machine; it must be thin enough to slightly see the wooden board or hand underneath. Cut 1.5-2in squares in the dough with a wheel cutter with straight edges. Place a dot of filling in the centre of each square. Fold each square into a triangle by putting pressure on the edges to properly seal the triangle. Then, grab the two edges of the triangle, wrap it around the tip of your pinky and pinch it so it closes.\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n--- \nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday."]}

Stretching from the majestic Southern Alps to the coastal town of Ōamaru, this trail offers a unique perspective on the cultural and historical significance of the regions it traverses.", "The country's longest continuous bike trail – the Alps to Ocean – takes travellers on a 315km journey into the seismic-shifting saga of Zealandia, Earth's \"lost\" continent.\nA young and restless country in Earth's development story, New Zealand lies along an exceptionally fractious crack in the planet's crust. Tectonically speaking, the landmass has been through a lot of upheaval in the (relatively short) 83 million years since it split from the Gondwana supercontinent to be on its own plate.  And now I am with my husband and two friends on New Zealand's longest continuous bike trail – the Alps to Ocean (A2O) – that will take us through the heart of this seismic-shifting saga.\n\"What you're passing through on the Alps to Ocean trail is the story of Zealandia, the eighth continent of the world,\" says geoscientist Sasha Morriss.\nAfter Zealandia departed Gondwana for Pacific isolation, it sank then erupted, giving rise to the Southern Alps extending across much of the nation's South Island and some of New Zealand's most remarkable landscapes. Its fossil-rich seabed also surfaced, revealing microscopic to megafauna skeletons that tell scientists about a disappeared sea and the severe weather patterns that followed to shape the country as we know it. A twist in the plot is that 94% of Zealandia remained \"lost\" underwater, hidden in plain sight, until satellite technology advanced and researchers officially mapped it 2017. \"New Zealand is just the very top,\" Morriss says.\nThe epic 315km A2O, one of the country's 23 Ngā Haerenga Great Rides, starts in the foothills of the country's highest peak, Aoraki/Mount Cook (3,724m). From here, it meanders through the Southern Alps' broad, glacier-carved valleys into Waitaki Whitestone Geopark, established in 2023, which Morriss describes as a \"vanished world\" where dolphins with shark-like teeth once swam in a warm shallow sea. The trail finishes at Ōamaru, a town literally built from the ancient seabed we'll ride on.\nIn parts, the A2O is so remote that at night the Milky Way can be seen in some of the clearest night skies in the world. However, isolation shouldn’t put anyone off: several companies offer guided trips, which include luggage transfers to prebooked accommodation (farmsteads, lake lodges and boutique B&Bs). A support vehicle tags along. But the good news is, with the number of e-bikes now available, it's unlikely riders will need it.\nUp until recently, the full A2O would only be tackled by very fit cyclists. However, e-bike supply chains have finally caught up from the surge in popularity during the pandemic and local adventure companies have invested in new fleets. The result is that the mainly smooth and predominantly undulating Alps 2 Ocean has opened up to a significantly wider demographic.\nAs adept cyclists with limited time, we've opted for regular mountain bikes on a customisable five-day self-guided trip. The raw newness of New Zealand hits us on our first easy 7km roll down a gravelly path to the Tasman Valley, where our ride is wonderfully interrupted by alpine headwaters that we need to cross by helicopter. Earth's forces only heaved up the Southern Alps – one of the world's fastest-growing and eroding ranges – within the last five million years. Streams of scree slide down near-vertical slopes. The sheer volume forces glacial meltwater into striking braids of milky blue and bright grey that fan out across the vast valley floor, which will eventually become the mighty 200km Waitaki River.\nWhile the icy knife edges of Aoraki/Mount Cook glare from above, a five-minute flight – with our mountain bikes swinging precariously in a cage underneath – gives us a bird's eye view of the sparkling phenomena. Deposited deeper into isolation, we jump back on our bikes and ride a colossal, vibrant, flat grassy plain to Lake Pūkaki. At 178sq km, it's the largest in a chain of brilliant turquoise glacial lakes to come. The juvenile spine of the Southern Alps keeps us company until we reach our cosy motel in the subalpine town of Twizel to wrap up our first (77km) day.\nThe next morning, we enter the 7,200 sq km Whitestone Waitaki Geopark – Australasia's only Unesco Global Geopark – where we spend a good chunk of the day exploring its squiggly foreshore, popping in and out of sheltered bays where we skim stones – perhaps a microfossil or two – across serene waters. It's easy to imagine the killer dolphins that lurked long before glaciers shunted, sculpting its ragged mountain surrounds. These pre-human shores were also a penguin paradise. According to studies of fossilised bones found in the geopark, a giant, 154kg penguin (Kumimanu fordycei) once shuffled around here, three times heavier than today's largest species, the emperor penguin.  \nThe following day is as tough as the A2O gets, with a steady 300m climb over a generous 5km through a shady forest to the journey's 900m highpoint at Tarnbrae. I'm several hundred years too late to spot a now-extinct Haast's eagle, but I can imagine this giant bird – the largest eagle to ever have existed, with a 3m wingspan and feet and claws as big as a modern day tiger's – gliding over the infinite prairie-like Mackenzie Basin. There's a big buzz in our plunge down a flowy trail into throngs of golden tussocks, where the huge eagle would've sank its claws into flightless prey, namely the ostrich-like moa bird that weighed as much as 250kg.\nAt this point, we think we've nailed the day, until we enter the hair-raising Sailors Cutting Scenic Reserve to ride a gusty 13km loose, narrow trail cut into the side of a sheer gorge that's so raw and exposed, I feel like I've been thrown back to Gondwanan times when plesiosaurs – ferocious long-necked marine dinosaurs – patrolled the shores. Prior to the A2O, seeing this part of the gorge was only possible by boat. By the time we get to our B&B in the tiny town of Otematata, we've clocked an exhausting 80kms that I'd move mountains to do again \nMore like this:• The Véloroute Gourmande: Canada's delectable 235km food trail• A new chance to hike Europe's ancient salt route• Europe's 'underdog leader' in slow-travel biking\nThe next day, on the 75km ride to ­­what feels like bustling Duntroon (population: 110), people play more of a part as the trail nods to cultural history and human development. We ride over the Waitaki dam and hydro-electric power station, built during the Great Depression, when locals (mostly) excavated half a million cubic metres (200 Olympic-sized swimming pools) using only picks and shovels. The ramshackle ruins of a hotel that served explorers in goldrush times is our rest stop and we sleep like logs in a lovingly restored 1908 farmstead.\nThe lion's share of geological action is packed into our fifth and final day. Here, the A2O overlaps with the 34km (drivable) Vanished World Trail where visitors can find the most accessible geological features, such as the oddly named Brewery Hole – a cavernous sinkhole in the ancient seabed from which \"bubbles forth a [underground] stream of pure sparkling water\", according to an article from 1877 in the North Otago Times. It's also an excellent demonstration of how acidic rainwater can perilously dissolve soft rock.\nThe nearby Valley of the Whales features a partially exposed baleen whale skeleton fossil, preserved in cliffs made from dead sea organisms that built up around 25 million years ago. A stone's throw away, we get more deeply immersed in the vanished sea as we ride on a grassy paddock through a surreal collection of grey mammoth boulders known as Elephant Rocks, which were formed when the seabed lifted and fractured. While softer surrounding sediments disappeared with the sea, weathering got to work sanding rough edges. Bizarrely, the rocks – some as big as houses – lie in a (accessible) farmer's field dotted with grazing sheep. Fans of The Chronicles of Narnia will recognise the scene (minus livestock) as Aslan's camp.\nIn the end, the country's largest fossil collection turns out to be Ōamaru, a grandiose Neoclassical port town built with rock quarried from its abundant limestone seabed surrounds.

Next to the pier is a large frame around a stage with “Alps 2 Ocean Cycle Trail” on it in golden letters.", "The Alps 2 Ocean Cycle Trail is not just a scenic route for cycling enthusiasts; it's a journey through time, culture, and history. Stretching from the majestic Southern Alps to the coastal town of Ōamaru, this trail offers a unique perspective on the cultural and historical significance of the regions it traverses.", "The country's longest continuous bike trail – the Alps to Ocean – takes travellers on a 315km journey into the seismic-shifting saga of Zealandia, Earth's \"lost\" continent.\nA young and restless country in Earth's development story, New Zealand lies along an exceptionally fractious crack in the planet's crust. Tectonically speaking, the landmass has been through a lot of upheaval in the (relatively short) 83 million years since it split from the Gondwana supercontinent to be on its own plate.  And now I am with my husband and two friends on New Zealand's longest continuous bike trail – the Alps to Ocean (A2O) – that will take us through the heart of this seismic-shifting saga.\n\"What you're passing through on the Alps to Ocean trail is the story of Zealandia, the eighth continent of the world,\" says geoscientist Sasha Morriss.\nAfter Zealandia departed Gondwana for Pacific isolation, it sank then erupted, giving rise to the Southern Alps extending across much of the nation's South Island and some of New Zealand's most remarkable landscapes. Its fossil-rich seabed also surfaced, revealing microscopic to megafauna skeletons that tell scientists about a disappeared sea and the severe weather patterns that followed to shape the country as we know it. A twist in the plot is that 94% of Zealandia remained \"lost\" underwater, hidden in plain sight, until satellite technology advanced and researchers officially mapped it 2017. \"New Zealand is just the very top,\" Morriss says.\nThe epic 315km A2O, one of the country's 23 Ngā Haerenga Great Rides, starts in the foothills of the country's highest peak, Aoraki/Mount Cook (3,724m). From here, it meanders through the Southern Alps' broad, glacier-carved valleys into Waitaki Whitestone Geopark, established in 2023, which Morriss describes as a \"vanished world\" where dolphins with shark-like teeth once swam in a warm shallow sea. The trail finishes at Ōamaru, a town literally built from the ancient seabed we'll ride on.\nIn parts, the A2O is so remote that at night the Milky Way can be seen in some of the clearest night skies in the world. However, isolation shouldn’t put anyone off: several companies offer guided trips, which include luggage transfers to prebooked accommodation (farmsteads, lake lodges and boutique B&Bs). A support vehicle tags along. But the good news is, with the number of e-bikes now available, it's unlikely riders will need it.\nUp until recently, the full A2O would only be tackled by very fit cyclists. However, e-bike supply chains have finally caught up from the surge in popularity during the pandemic and local adventure companies have invested in new fleets. The result is that the mainly smooth and predominantly undulating Alps 2 Ocean has opened up to a significantly wider demographic.\nAs adept cyclists with limited time, we've opted for regular mountain bikes on a customisable five-day self-guided trip. The raw newness of New Zealand hits us on our first easy 7km roll down a gravelly path to the Tasman Valley, where our ride is wonderfully interrupted by alpine headwaters that we need to cross by helicopter. Earth's forces only heaved up the Southern Alps – one of the world's fastest-growing and eroding ranges – within the last five million years. Streams of scree slide down near-vertical slopes. The sheer volume forces glacial meltwater into striking braids of milky blue and bright grey that fan out across the vast valley floor, which will eventually become the mighty 200km Waitaki River.\nWhile the icy knife edges of Aoraki/Mount Cook glare from above, a five-minute flight – with our mountain bikes swinging precariously in a cage underneath – gives us a bird's eye view of the sparkling phenomena. Deposited deeper into isolation, we jump back on our bikes and ride a colossal, vibrant, flat grassy plain to Lake Pūkaki. At 178sq km, it's the largest in a chain of brilliant turquoise glacial lakes to come. The juvenile spine of the Southern Alps keeps us company until we reach our cosy motel in the subalpine town of Twizel to wrap up our first (77km) day.\nThe next morning, we enter the 7,200 sq km Whitestone Waitaki Geopark – Australasia's only Unesco Global Geopark – where we spend a good chunk of the day exploring its squiggly foreshore, popping in and out of sheltered bays where we skim stones – perhaps a microfossil or two – across serene waters. It's easy to imagine the killer dolphins that lurked long before glaciers shunted, sculpting its ragged mountain surrounds. These pre-human shores were also a penguin paradise. According to studies of fossilised bones found in the geopark, a giant, 154kg penguin (Kumimanu fordycei) once shuffled around here, three times heavier than today's largest species, the emperor penguin.  \nThe following day is as tough as the A2O gets, with a steady 300m climb over a generous 5km through a shady forest to the journey's 900m highpoint at Tarnbrae. I'm several hundred years too late to spot a now-extinct Haast's eagle, but I can imagine this giant bird – the largest eagle to ever have existed, with a 3m wingspan and feet and claws as big as a modern day tiger's – gliding over the infinite prairie-like Mackenzie Basin. There's a big buzz in our plunge down a flowy trail into throngs of golden tussocks, where the huge eagle would've sank its claws into flightless prey, namely the ostrich-like moa bird that weighed as much as 250kg.\nAt this point, we think we've nailed the day, until we enter the hair-raising Sailors Cutting Scenic Reserve to ride a gusty 13km loose, narrow trail cut into the side of a sheer gorge that's so raw and exposed, I feel like I've been thrown back to Gondwanan times when plesiosaurs – ferocious long-necked marine dinosaurs – patrolled the shores. Prior to the A2O, seeing this part of the gorge was only possible by boat. By the time we get to our B&B in the tiny town of Otematata, we've clocked an exhausting 80kms that I'd move mountains to do again \nMore like this:• The Véloroute Gourmande: Canada's delectable 235km food trail• A new chance to hike Europe's ancient salt route• Europe's 'underdog leader' in slow-travel biking\nThe next day, on the 75km ride to ­­what feels like bustling Duntroon (population: 110), people play more of a part as the trail nods to cultural history and human development. We ride over the Waitaki dam and hydro-electric power station, built during the Great Depression, when locals (mostly) excavated half a million cubic metres (200 Olympic-sized swimming pools) using only picks and shovels. The ramshackle ruins of a hotel that served explorers in goldrush times is our rest stop and we sleep like logs in a lovingly restored 1908 farmstead.\nThe lion's share of geological action is packed into our fifth and final day. Here, the A2O overlaps with the 34km (drivable) Vanished World Trail where visitors can find the most accessible geological features, such as the oddly named Brewery Hole – a cavernous sinkhole in the ancient seabed from which \"bubbles forth a [underground] stream of pure sparkling water\", according to an article from 1877 in the North Otago Times. It's also an excellent demonstration of how acidic rainwater can perilously dissolve soft rock.\nThe nearby Valley of the Whales features a partially exposed baleen whale skeleton fossil, preserved in cliffs made from dead sea organisms that built up around 25 million years ago. A stone's throw away, we get more deeply immersed in the vanished sea as we ride on a grassy paddock through a surreal collection of grey mammoth boulders known as Elephant Rocks, which were formed when the seabed lifted and fractured. While softer surrounding sediments disappeared with the sea, weathering got to work sanding rough edges. Bizarrely, the rocks – some as big as houses – lie in a (accessible) farmer's field dotted with grazing sheep. Fans of The Chronicles of Narnia will recognise the scene (minus livestock) as Aslan's camp.\nIn the end, the country's largest fossil collection turns out to be Ōamaru, a grandiose Neoclassical port town built with rock quarried from its abundant limestone seabed surrounds. After all, limestone is mostly billions of decayed ancient sea creatures that have been cemented together over millions of years. And rather like the lost continent of Zealandia, it's been hidden in plain sight all along.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Set in a Gaeltacht, (Irish-speaking district) the city is especially enjoying a resurgence of traditional Irish music – known locally as \"trad\", a name that gives the genre a hipster cool, far from its humble origins as tunes played in kitchens and street corners.\nWe asked Galway native Enda Scahill, one of Ireland's foremost banjo players, to help us find his hometown's best trad music sessions. At just 11 years old, Scahill was performing at pubs packed with tourists eager to experience Ireland's traditional music. \"At the time, there was definitely the perception of Irish music as shamrocks, leprechauns and 'Danny Boy'. But, just like jazz and bluegrass, there are layers upon layers of depth,\" says Scahill. \"Galway is a very small town, but you can catch two sessions a day, every day of the week… Young people proudly play old-time music, and so the quality of musicians at the moment is exceptional.

And banjo players too.\"\nWhen Scahill was a teen, there was one banjo player in the west of Ireland, \"and we'd drive an hour and a half, which was a big deal in rural Ireland in the '80s, what with the bad cars and bad roads\". Now, Irish banjo players are everywhere in the trad music scene, and he's taught a fair share of them.\n\"Everybody wants to come to Galway!\" he says. \"We have a fantastic reputation for fun, food and the amazing scenery of Connemara at our doorstep.\" And all are invited, listener or player. \"The sessions are very welcoming. There's no gatekeeper.\"\nHere are Scahill's favourite places to catch trad music in Galway.\n\"Tig Cóilí is probably the most famous pub in Galway,\" says Scahill. Despite its prime spot at the car-free crossroads of Mainguard and Shop Streets, this cosy pub has a country tavern feel.\nUS dollar bills, police badges and framed photos of famous faces – Paul Brady, Sharon Shannon, Dessie O'Halloran, Frankie Gavin and Máirtín O'Connor – cover the walls, giving the pub a well-worn, lived-in charm. \"It looks 100 years old, but I remember, before it became Tig Cóilí, it was a modern-style pub, mostly quiet except for, as people would say, 'swingers at two o'clock in the afternoon,' says Scahill.\nMusicians squeeze into a corner booth by the fire-engine-red windows for two daily sessions.

It's also become a real hub where Galway people meet [County] Clare people… I've only played there a handful of times, but it's a really lovely spot. They've recently added glass doors that open to an ocean view, and you hear some amazing musicians.\"\nUpstairs, the restaurant serves locally sourced dishes from Kinvara's organic farmers and foragers, adding a touch of refinement to the laid-back vibe of the sessions taking place below. Just beyond the county line is the otherworldly karst landscape of the Burren and the legendary Cliffs of Moher.\nWebsite: www.upstairsatconnollys.ieAddress: The Quay, Kinvara, Co.

Then you've got Inishmaan, the middle one – 'maan' means average. Finally, there's Inisheer, since 'sheer' means small.\"\n\"They really put a lot of thought into those names,\" he deadpans.\nOn Inisheer, find Tigh Ned tucked inside a thatched cottage that's been in the Ó Conghaile family since 1897. From April to October, musicians fill the salty air with the sounds of sweet trad. \"It's as 'country pub' as you want on an island.\"\nThe kitchen serves classic pub fare and fresh seafood. Scahill recommends calling ahead to order the crab special. \"Every morning their boats come back filled with these big brown Atlantic crabs. They boil them in the back and serve them with brown bread and butter. It's the most spectacular meal you'll ever have. My son and his friend had it when they were about nine, and years later, they're still talking about it.\"\nWebsite: www.tighned.com Address: Inisheer, Aran Islands, Co.

First built in 1899, the train, which travels more than 1,700km from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi on a single track, was bombed several times during the Vietnam War to cut off the important connections between the communist north and US-controlled south of the country.

Ahead of the 2024 race, the actor shares his Bat City picks, from live music to breakfast tacos.\nAustin, Texas, is known for its barbecue, cowboy culture, breakfast tacos, rollicking music scene and its defiant slogan: \"Keep Austin Weird.\"\nBut since 2012, when the Circuit of The Americas in Travis County, located 15 miles south-east of the city, hosted its inaugural United States Grand Prix, Austin has also been considered the American home for Formula One.\nActor Gabriel Luna fell in love with the sport when he was invited to the 2016 United States Grand Prix. \"Just the speed, the sounds, meeting all of the drivers. It was really exciting,\" says Luna.\nAfter striking up a friendship with the Haas F1 team, Luna has since attended races in Budapest, Monza and Montreal. He's also returned to his home city of Austin, where he was born, raised and attended university, to watch the United States Grand Prix live on three more occasions.\n\"I just fell in love with the sport. I've seen it grow exponentially year after year,\" says Luna, who credits the Netflix documentary series Drive to Survive for bringing more US attention to the sport. While Miami and Las Vegas now host their own races, Luna believes that Austin's distinctive free-wheeling spirit and party atmosphere make it the best place to watch Formula One in the US.\n\"Having the race in Austin is a great way to show off the city,\" he says. \"It's a truly beautiful part of the country. But also the city is built on music, food and enjoying life. We attract a lot of bon vivants who just want to live a good life and they can get that in Austin.\"\nHere are Luna's favourite ways to experience his hometown.\nLocated within Austin's bustling Zilker Metropolitan Park is the scenic Barton Springs Pool, where for just a small fee, visitors can relax on the grass and jump into its water all year-round. For Luna, this three-acre pool fed by underground springs is the \"centre of culture and life\" in Austin. \"You get to see Austin's youth, its old-timers, its hippies doing their yoga, people playing guitar. Everyone is just jumping into the water, which is perpetually 68 degrees.\"\nWhen Luna is home in the summer months, he loves relaxing by the water, jumping in, drying off and jumping back in – on repeat. \"You can just lay out on the hill on the far side of Barton Springs and see the whole city. It's the heart of the town.\"\nWebsite: https://www.austintexas.gov/department/barton-springs-poolAddress: 2131 William Barton Dr., Austin, TX 78746Phone number: (512) 974-6300Instagram: @austincityparks\nWhile Austin is renowned for its food, booze and music scenes, it also has a bevy of fantastic museums. Luna's favourite is the Emma S Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center, located in Rainey Street Historic District right by Lady Bird Lake. \"It's in this beautiful building, which itself is a work of art,\" says Luna, whose parents were both of Mexican descent. \"But it also has a theatre, a gallery and their rotating exhibits celebrate Mexican American arts and heritage.\"\nLuna also points visitors to The Blanton Museum of Art at the Austin chapter of the University of Texas, which has more than 21,000 works of modern and contemporary art from Europe, the United States and Latin America. It's also home to renowned American artist Ellsworth Kelly's immersive art building Austin; famed for its natural depiction of light and colour.\nWebsite: https://www.austintexas.gov/department/emma-s-barrientos-mexican-american-cultural-centerAddress: 600 River St, Austin, TX 78701Phone number: (512) 974-3772Instagram: @esbmacc\nAustin, which bills itself as the \"live music capital of the world\", has a wildly diverse music scene rivalling those of Nashville, Memphis and even New Orleans. \"Culturally in Austin, it's all about the music. You just have to get out there, catch a band and listen to the music,\" says Luna.\nThe actor and sometimes musician loves Broken Spoke, an old-school spot that's been serving beer and chicken-fried steak and hosting bands since 1964. \"It's protected by the National Registry and is an incredible little honky-tonk bar that can't be touched,\" says Luna. \"The community gathered together to acquire enough signatures to stop it from being purchased.\"\nAnother venue Luna calls his \"personal headquarters\" is Antone's; one of Austin’s most iconic blues venues. Antone's, now found on Fifth Street, might have moved locations a few times since the original location opened in 1975, but that hasn't stopped the likes of Ray Charles, James Brown, Willie Nelson and Stevie Ray Vaughan from playing its stages. \"It's really home for me when I'm back in Austin.\"\nFor even more live music, Luna also suggests The Continental Club and the juke joint C-Boy's Heart & Soul, both found on Congress Street; one of downtown Austin's premier shopping and entertainment districts.\nWebsite: https://www.brokenspokeaustintx.net/Address: 3201 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704Phone number: (512) 442-6189Instagram: @brokenspokeaustintx\nLuna can't help but get nostalgic when asked about breakfast tacos; a Tex-Mex dish of scrambled eggs, cheeses, veg and meat wrapped in a tortilla that's become known as an Austin specialty. He laments a number of places which have closed, in particular Maria's Taco Express on South Lamar Boulevard, which shut its doors in September 2020. Luna also insists that the best breakfast tacos in Austin are at his grandmother's house, which he ate every morning for 12 years before school.\nRather than badgering her for them, Luna heads to Juan in A Million in East Austin. \"It's a great Mexican restaurant that has fantastic breakfast tacos,\" he says. Juan in a Million's menu features a full array of breakfast taco choices, from chorizo (sausage) to migas-style (with soft scrambled eggs and crispy fried tortilla strips). If you're in the north of the city, Luna suggests Tierra Linda Taqueria, a wonderful no-frills eatery located in a gas station serving huge orders.\nWebsite: https://juaninamillion.com/Address: 2300 E Cesar Chavez St, Austin, TX 78702Phone number: (512) 472-3872Instagram: @juaninamillionrestaurant\nThe great state of Texas is barbecue country, and Austin takes the craft very seriously. For great central Texas-style barbecue, Luna says visitors can never go wrong at Austin cult favourite Franklin Barbecue; a turquoise-and-white roadside stop on 11th Street instantly recognisable by its massive queue. Founded in 2009 by Aaron Franklin, the spot was named the best barbecue in the country by Bon Appétit in 2011. \"Aaron is a legend who has created an incredible legacy for himself,\" says Luna. \"I've lived in Los Angeles since 2011 and I always get his [barbecued beef] brisket shipped out for my Super Bowl parties.\"\nLuna also recommends Black's Barbecue, founded in 1932 and located in Lockhart; a 30-minute drive from Austin. But he quickly adds that Terry Black's BBQ is also worth a visit; explaining that the two restaurants have been engulfed in a family rivalry since the latter was opened by twin brothers Mike and Mark when they didn't approve of their Uncle Kent's cooking techniques at Black's. \"They're both great,\" says Luna. \"The brisket in particular at Black's is fantastic.\"\nUltimately, Luna says, \"There's lots of great barbecue across Austin. At a certain point it's a little but like splitting hairs because so much of it tastes so good.\"\nWebsite: https://franklinbbq.com/Address: 900 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78702Phone number: (512) 653-1187Instagram: @franklinbbq\nAs Austin continues to become one of the most desirable cities in America, Luna notes that its food-scene has improved dramatically.\nHis favourite burgers in Austin are found at the Casino El Camino and Sandy's Hamburgers, while he hits the Taqueria Arandas chain for Mexican food, the posh Uchi for elevated sushi, Justine's for a hip French brasserie experience, the generational Hoover's Cooking on Manor Road for farm-to-table soul food and East Side Pies for thin crust pizza.\nOne Austin dish that Luna thinks is underrated is a good bowl of queso; a creamy dip made of melted cheese. \"People do it in a really artful way,\" he says. \"Then you just get some tortilla chips and dip them in there. It's like a fondue.\" Luna calls Magnolia Café – a vintage Tex Mex-influenced diner on Congress Street – the best place to eat queso in Austin, as they mix in avocado, beef, salsa, pico de gallo, black beans and jalapeño to create their own signature take on the dish. \"It's the perfect thing to eat after a long night of drinking and when you're really drunk,\" he says.\nWebsite: https://www.magnoliacafeaustin.com/Address: 1920 South Congress Ave, Austin TX 78704Phone number: (512) 445-0000Instagram: @magnoliacafeaustin\nAustin's Sixth Street is renowned for its long stretch of bars, which Luna says you can stumble between with ease: \"They all have different personalities. You can pop into The Jackalope [a dive] or Maggie Mae's [massive event space]\".\nNowadays Luna prefers a more laid-back vibe, which is what you get when you head farther east on Sixth Street to his favourite watering hole: Whisler's. \"It's got a really cool little secret Mezcal bar,\" he says. \"You go up this little spiral staircase and there's a very small room and a tiny bar. They have a fine collection of mezcals up there.\" The nearby White Horse honky-tonk plays great country music, and Luna also suggests the Uptown Sports Club for a classy yet still casual ambience.\nWebsite: https://whislersatx.com/Address: 1816 E 6th St, Austin, TX 78702Phone number: (512) 480-0781Instagram: @whislersatx\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

{"id": 362, "question": "What is the elevation of Kamikochi?", "answer": ["1,500m"], "doc": ["Kamikochi is a grand valley at the elevation of 1,500 meters formed deep in the Northern Japan Alps, where mountains over 3,000 meters high range. Renowned in Japan for its beautiful mountainous scenery, it is designated not only as the Chubu Sangaku National Park but also as a special place of scenic beauty and a special natural monument in Japan.", "The average elevation of the valley floor ranges between roughly 1,400 m (4,600 ft) above sea level at the south end and roughly 1,600 m (5,200 ft) at the northern tip. Kamikōchi is located in the Hida Mountains, the \"Northern Alps\" of the Japanese Alps. The surrounding mountains reach 3,190 m (10,470 ft).", "Mount Yari is also a popular objective for climbers.Many of them start their ascent from Kamikochi. See the SP-page of MountYari for more information about this peak. Tokusawa Lodge and campground is located in theTokusawa area of Kamikochi. It is surrounded by nature and offers a great view of Mt.Hotaka.", "​ Kamikochi is a mountainous valley centred around the Azusa River, with an elevation of about 1500m. The mellow plateau and turquoise river is the main reason it gets so busy, anyone can come here for a casual walk or a weekend of camping without the need to hike any mountains.", "See the SP-page ofHotaka-dake for more information about this peak. Mount Yariga-take is often referred to as Mount Yari. This peak is with is 3180meters among the highest peaks in Japan and is locates to the north of itshigher neighbor Hotaka-dake. This mountain is famous because of it’s amazingpyramid shaped summit.", "With a record 35 million foreign visitors expected in Japan this year, Kamikochi is an idyllic, relaxing break from some of the country's more heavily touristed destinations.\nNestled in the Japanese Alps at 1,500m elevation, the seasonal resort town of Kamikochi is an idyllic, car-free getaway with cool, crisp mountain air, riverside hiking trails and an abundance of Japanese snow monkeys. There are no private homes, year-round residents or chain stores of any kind – no McDonald’s, Starbucks or Burger King; instead, it's known as an escape from the enervating heat that grips most of Japan in the summertime and for its abundant, sublime autumn colours that peak in October. I loved it immediately, though my teenage sons, Leo and James baulked at the communal shower arrangement in our hotel.\nTheir mood brightened, though, as I explained that our agenda for our three-day, two-night stay included nothing but hiking, eating and relaxing. \"No museums, no temples?\" James gleefully asked. We'd arrived in Kamikochi roughly mid-way through a month-long trip around Honshu, Japan’s largest island, and by this point the boys had seen far too many temples, shrines and museums for their tastes. Kamikochi, we reassured them, would be a holiday from our holiday in a simple place with a few clusters of hotels, restaurants and shops all clustered along the Azusa River.\nThe quest to find pristine natural environs unspoiled by mass tourism long predates the social media era. In his 1896 book, Mountaineering and Exploration in the Japanese Alps, the English missionary, climber and conservationist Reverend Walter Weston echoed the sentiments of an unnamed Japanese writer who complained of \"foreign tourists who come to his country, and after rushing through it at the rate of 40 miles an hour then hurry home to record their impressions and pose as authorities on what they have only glanced at\".\nIn his writings and lectures, Weston popularised the term \"Japanese Alps\" and put the area that became the resort town of Kamikochi on the radar of international tourists. The town's popularity as a holiday destination for Japanese tourists spiked in 1927 with the release of Kappa, a novel set in Kamikochi written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, one of Japan's most famous writers. In 1934, Chūbu-Sangaku National Park, home to Kamikochi and 10 of Japan’s 21 peaks over 3,000m, was established and the area became known as the \"most beautiful valley in Japan\", inspiring comparisons with California's Yosemite National Park.\nWith all the media hype about overtourism and rising visitor numbers in Japan, I hoped Kamikochi would be a relaxing break from some of the more heavily touristed destinations like Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo, which we’d visited, and enjoyed, earlier in the trip.  \nIn the nearby gateway city of Kanazawa, I asked our volunteer guide, Michiko Kitaguchi, whom we found through the excellent Kanazawa Goodwill Guide association, about Kamikochi, and she said that in Chinese, Kamikochi fittingly means \"a place where the god descends\". Her favourite time of year in Kamikochi is autumn when the colours in the valley are spectacular. \n\"I am a Kamikochi lover who goes there every year to feel the energy of nature,\" she said. \"The sounds of the river flowing, the autumn-coloured mountains of the Hodaka, the golden Japanese larch forest by the river is really stunning in the fall.\"\nKamikochi has been a green getaway since 1975 when private cars and motorcycles were banned in response to rising traffic and visitor numbers and a desire to preserve the place’s tranquillity. In fact, conservation efforts began a century earlier, in 1875, when the former logging town banned felling trees in the area to preserve its natural beauty. Laws were passed to prevent the removal of alpine plants in 1909, and it was the first area in the country to be formally designated as a \"protection forest\" in 1916. In 1963, officials established the Kamikochi Beautification Association to address the issue of littering and poor tourist etiquette more broadly. In the ‘70s, the number of hotels and inns was capped at 17, the same number that exist today (along with a pair of campsites; there are no Airbnbs).\nThe place has an egalitarian appeal in that almost everyone arrives by bus – if you try to drive, you have to park about half an hour away and take a bus anyway; and the only other option is to hike in or take a taxi, though few visitors opt to do this. A hybrid bus route to Kamikochi was established in 1994, leaving from Takayama, our prior stop, and also Matsumoto, famous for its striking 16th-Century castle, and tour buses were banned in 2005.\nAs we exited the bus terminal with our baggage, I was glad that we'd chosen a nearby hotel: the Nishi-itoya Mountain Lodge, which has private rooms and hostel-style bunk rooms. Other options, like the historic Tokusawa Inn, founded in 1885, require a one- to two-hour hike from the bus terminal with your luggage.\nWe walked across the Kappa bridge, named after Akutagawa's novel, and immediately slalomed through a mob of selfie stick-toting tourists. I reckoned that Kamikochi wasn't as off-the-beaten path as we'd hoped, though it was noon on a Saturday, which is rarely an ideal time to have a place all to yourself.\nWe drew up a plan to take three easy hikes, one for each day of our visit, and avoid all the steep knee-shattering treks up Mt Jonen, Mt Chogatake, Mt Oku-Hotakadake and others. (The national park has 40 mountain peaks with altitudes of more than 2,400m.) On our first hike to Myojin Pond, I felt the wish-I-could-bottle-it travel high I live for as a compulsive traveller as we met one troop of mischievous Japanese snow monkeys after another while hiking along and near the river. It was a balmy 18C and the crisp mountain air was a welcome relief from the steamy streets of Takayama. Kamikochi is a major birding destination, and we could hear what a birder told me were Japanese bush warblers singing what sounded like, \"hoo-ke-kyo\". \nKamikochi drew 1.3 million visitors, mostly Japanese, in 2023. Most years, 100 million or more visit Mt Fuji, which, along with Kamikochi, is the only other destination designated by Japan's Cultural Affairs Agency as both a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and a Special Natural Monument. We were also pleased to discover that many of Kamikochi's visitors are day-trippers who disappear by late afternoon. After the initial crush of tourists we'd seen at the Kappa bridge on our first afternoon, Kamikochi didn't seem overly touristy or spoiled.  \n\"Where do you live?\" I asked one of the friendly restaurant servers at our hotel. \"In a dormitory for workers right back there,\" she replied, pointing behind the hotel's annex.  She explained that Kamikochi is only open to visitors from 27 April to 15 November because it’s too cold in winter to attract guests. On those dates, elaborate opening and closing ceremonies take place, presided over by Shinto priests who give thanks to nature as revellers indulge in cups of hot sake. There's also a popular boat festival in October, but in the offseason, it's a ghost town and workers like our server migrate elsewhere.\nMore like this:• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024• Why you should visit Japan's small but mighty 'little Kyoto'• The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world \nI asked if she enjoys living in such a transient place, and the young woman pulled out her phone to answer my question. \"Last week, I went on a long hike and took these,\" she said, swiping through some striking photos of Taisho Pond, a large body of water flanked by volcanic, snow-capped Mt Yakedake, which erupted in 1915, effectively damming the Azusa River and creating this picturesque pond. \"This is why I'm happy here.\"\nTaisho Pond, the end point of our final hike, was indeed stunning. The craggy mountains with their serpentine dustings of snow looked like something out of a fantasy world created by Akutagawa, the writer who took his own life at age 35 shortly after the publication of Kappa. In the novel, the protagonist visits Kamikochi in search of tranquillity, but finds the place inhabited by a strange race of 1m-tall, sumo-loving water spirits he called kappas.\nWe encountered nothing so strange, though my sons strongly objected to the nudity in the onsen (natural hot springs). But we found that Japan's conservation efforts to preserve the wild beauty of Kamikochi that seduced Weston, Akutagawa and others have largely succeeded. Indeed, there aren't many places left where you can enjoy a car-free holiday in a place where you're guaranteed to hear birdsong rather than car horns and see snow monkeys but no McDonalds.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

I loved it immediately, though my teenage sons, Leo and James baulked at the communal shower arrangement in our hotel.\nTheir mood brightened, though, as I explained that our agenda for our three-day, two-night stay included nothing but hiking, eating and relaxing. \"No museums, no temples?\" James gleefully asked. We'd arrived in Kamikochi roughly mid-way through a month-long trip around Honshu, Japan’s largest island, and by this point the boys had seen far too many temples, shrines and museums for their tastes. Kamikochi, we reassured them, would be a holiday from our holiday in a simple place with a few clusters of hotels, restaurants and shops all clustered along the Azusa River.\nThe quest to find pristine natural environs unspoiled by mass tourism long predates the social media era. In his 1896 book, Mountaineering and Exploration in the Japanese Alps, the English missionary, climber and conservationist Reverend Walter Weston echoed the sentiments of an unnamed Japanese writer who complained of \"foreign tourists who come to his country, and after rushing through it at the rate of 40 miles an hour then hurry home to record their impressions and pose as authorities on what they have only glanced at\".\nIn his writings and lectures, Weston popularised the term \"Japanese Alps\" and put the area that became the resort town of Kamikochi on the radar of international tourists. The town's popularity as a holiday destination for Japanese tourists spiked in 1927 with the release of Kappa, a novel set in Kamikochi written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, one of Japan's most famous writers. In 1934, Chūbu-Sangaku National Park, home to Kamikochi and 10 of Japan’s 21 peaks over 3,000m, was established and the area became known as the \"most beautiful valley in Japan\", inspiring comparisons with California's Yosemite National Park.\nWith all the media hype about overtourism and rising visitor numbers in Japan, I hoped Kamikochi would be a relaxing break from some of the more heavily touristed destinations like Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo, which we’d visited, and enjoyed, earlier in the trip.  \nIn the nearby gateway city of Kanazawa, I asked our volunteer guide, Michiko Kitaguchi, whom we found through the excellent Kanazawa Goodwill Guide association, about Kamikochi, and she said that in Chinese, Kamikochi fittingly means \"a place where the god descends\". Her favourite time of year in Kamikochi is autumn when the colours in the valley are spectacular. \n\"I am a Kamikochi lover who goes there every year to feel the energy of nature,\" she said. \"The sounds of the river flowing, the autumn-coloured mountains of the Hodaka, the golden Japanese larch forest by the river is really stunning in the fall.\"\nKamikochi has been a green getaway since 1975 when private cars and motorcycles were banned in response to rising traffic and visitor numbers and a desire to preserve the place’s tranquillity. In fact, conservation efforts began a century earlier, in 1875, when the former logging town banned felling trees in the area to preserve its natural beauty. Laws were passed to prevent the removal of alpine plants in 1909, and it was the first area in the country to be formally designated as a \"protection forest\" in 1916. In 1963, officials established the Kamikochi Beautification Association to address the issue of littering and poor tourist etiquette more broadly. In the ‘70s, the number of hotels and inns was capped at 17, the same number that exist today (along with a pair of campsites; there are no Airbnbs).\nThe place has an egalitarian appeal in that almost everyone arrives by bus – if you try to drive, you have to park about half an hour away and take a bus anyway; and the only other option is to hike in or take a taxi, though few visitors opt to do this. A hybrid bus route to Kamikochi was established in 1994, leaving from Takayama, our prior stop, and also Matsumoto, famous for its striking 16th-Century castle, and tour buses were banned in 2005.\nAs we exited the bus terminal with our baggage, I was glad that we'd chosen a nearby hotel: the Nishi-itoya Mountain Lodge, which has private rooms and hostel-style bunk rooms. Other options, like the historic Tokusawa Inn, founded in 1885, require a one- to two-hour hike from the bus terminal with your luggage.\nWe walked across the Kappa bridge, named after Akutagawa's novel, and immediately slalomed through a mob of selfie stick-toting tourists. I reckoned that Kamikochi wasn't as off-the-beaten path as we'd hoped, though it was noon on a Saturday, which is rarely an ideal time to have a place all to yourself.\nWe drew up a plan to take three easy hikes, one for each day of our visit, and avoid all the steep knee-shattering treks up Mt Jonen, Mt Chogatake, Mt Oku-Hotakadake and others. (The national park has 40 mountain peaks with altitudes of more than 2,400m.) On our first hike to Myojin Pond, I felt the wish-I-could-bottle-it travel high I live for as a compulsive traveller as we met one troop of mischievous Japanese snow monkeys after another while hiking along and near the river. It was a balmy 18C and the crisp mountain air was a welcome relief from the steamy streets of Takayama. Kamikochi is a major birding destination, and we could hear what a birder told me were Japanese bush warblers singing what sounded like, \"hoo-ke-kyo\". \nKamikochi drew 1.3 million visitors, mostly Japanese, in 2023. Most years, 100 million or more visit Mt Fuji, which, along with Kamikochi, is the only other destination designated by Japan's Cultural Affairs Agency as both a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and a Special Natural Monument. We were also pleased to discover that many of Kamikochi's visitors are day-trippers who disappear by late afternoon. After the initial crush of tourists we'd seen at the Kappa bridge on our first afternoon, Kamikochi didn't seem overly touristy or spoiled.  \n\"Where do you live?\" I asked one of the friendly restaurant servers at our hotel. \"In a dormitory for workers right back there,\" she replied, pointing behind the hotel's annex.  She explained that Kamikochi is only open to visitors from 27 April to 15 November because it’s too cold in winter to attract guests. On those dates, elaborate opening and closing ceremonies take place, presided over by Shinto priests who give thanks to nature as revellers indulge in cups of hot sake.

In the novel, the protagonist visits Kamikochi in search of tranquillity, but finds the place inhabited by a strange race of 1m-tall, sumo-loving water spirits he called kappas.\nWe encountered nothing so strange, though my sons strongly objected to the nudity in the onsen (natural hot springs). But we found that Japan's conservation efforts to preserve the wild beauty of Kamikochi that seduced Weston, Akutagawa and others have largely succeeded.

The soundtrack was whispering wind, singing birds and rushing water as a river tumbled down the valley.\n\"Look around, we have mountains and glaciers and are far from everyday life. This is a challenge, but also our blessing.\" \nHard-to-reach hotels and huts are a Swiss specialty, with many preserved as monuments to Alpine history. The Jungfrau Region, within the snow-ruffled reaches of the Bernese Alps, is for lofty shelters in the car-free villages of Mürren, Wengen and Kleine Scheidegg, where accommodation can only be accessed by ski lift, cable car or cogwheel train. These are places of meditation, where hikers wander and the mind slows.\nThen there is an alphabet of striking refuges hidden in mountain eyries, from the Appenzell Alps to Zermatt. Great St Bernard Hospice in Valais is a remarkable example, requiring a continual push by snowshoe in winter, or a high-altitude access road, which only opens to traffic after the thaw.\nBut Alp Grüm, straddling a razor-edge ridge on the south side of the Bernina Pass at 2,091m, pushes such extremes to the limits. It is caught between languages, with the immediate north speaking Romansh and the valley below Italian. There is no road to it beneath Piz Bernina, the highest peak of the Eastern Alps. And the only way to get there year-round is to hike in for hours – not recommended in winter – or take the Rhaetian Railway that climbs high between the little towns of Pontresina and Poschiavo near the Italian border.\nWhat's more, the hotel's identity is wholly drawn from the history of the rail company, and it doubles as train station, platform and waiting room. Between 20:00 and 08:00, however, the trains leave the rails and the hotel is cut off from the rest of Switzerland, left to exist in a bubble of its own. \nVisiting the Alps can so often feel like stepping into a storybook, and that feeling is particularly strong in the Engadin valley, where the horizon is a lithograph of great mountains that crest like waves. I've been to the area many times – to measure my experience of Switzerland at its wildest against that of the pioneers of winter sports tourism – but this time I was in comfort, on board the Bernina Express and travelling south from Chur, the oldest town in Switzerland.\nThe story of Alp Grüm started in 1906 with Bernina-Bahngesellschaft, a visionary rail company that unveiled an ambitious plan for an electrified train connecting Switzerland with Italy beneath a roll and tumble of mountains and glaciers. What made the idea so extraordinary was that it would become the Alps' highest rail crossing, prising open the area for tourists but also slashing travel time for traders; back then, it took horse-riding messengers nine hours to complete the dangerous journey between Samedan and Tirano. The struggle was intensified in winter due to avalanche risk and the possibility of becoming stranded by heavy snowfall.\nTo say Switzerland did not have precedent for this sort of engineering project would be to engage in understatement. Thirty years prior in 1888, Dutch hotelier Willem Jan Holsboer founded the nearby Landquart-Davos narrow-gauge railway. The town of Davos is best known for the World Economic Forum, but its roots are as a spa town, and Holsboer capitalised by way of bringing more visitors to the resort than the horse-drawn carriages did. No less of a marvel before that was the opening of the Gotthard Railway from Immensee to Chiasso in 1882, featuring what was then the world's longest rail tunnel.\nIt was against this background, on a sunny day in July 1910, that the Bernina Line was opened and Alp Grüm began life – not as a stone-built, 10-room hotel and waiting room as it is today, but as a timber cabin, from where the station chief could check the line every morning. \nThe Rhaetian Railway took control of the Bernina Line in 1943, and the idea, as company spokesperson Camille Härdi describes it, was simply \"a rest stop\" – a notion that is hard to believe today.\n\"The Bernina Line wasn't even originally supposed to operate all year round,\" Härdi said. \"However, the railway's management board decided in 1910 – once the line to Tirano had been finished – to acquire a snow plough. It first came into use in the winter of 1910/11 and proved to be a wondrous piece of technology, capable of cutting the considerable costs normally associated with snow-clearing.\"\nThese days, the Bernina Line rarely, if ever, closes, meaning Alp Grüm is no longer the Shangri-La it once was. \"Winter has changed over the years with the glaciers receding and global warming,\" said Härdi. \"Even so, it still happens there is plenty of snow. There's a locomotive called a 'Snow Blower' that makes sure the train runs even after a heavy snowfall.\"\nImagine the excitement of trainspotters today: the Unesco World Heritage-listed Bernina Line is home to the world's only self-propelled, steam-powered snow plough locomotive.\n \nBut plenty of the original impulse to build Alp Grüm survives. The geometry of the glaciers and lakes remains impeccably beautiful, and when I arrived, I was immediately transfixed by the Palü Glacier and the blue-green Lago Palü at its terminus.\nAbove was Ospizio Bernina, the Alps' highest rail crossing at 2,253m. Far below, looking down towards Valposchiavo, the serpentine curve of the tracks switch-backed down a steeply pitched slope. Foregrounding that, the station, remodelled in stone in 1923, was gloriously isolated. It had the air of an Italian villa transferred to a mountaintop, with pizzoccheri (flat short buckwheat noodles) the specialty of its platform restaurant. \nMore like this:• Europe's stunning high-tech luxury train• A new night train connecting some of Europe's great cities• The Train d'Artouste: Europe's highest narrow-gauge train\nThe hardest part about living at Alp Grüm, according to Semadeni, who has spent 18 years here, is the unpredictability each day brings. And to put it mildly, it was one of those days. \"This morning, one of my waitresses quit,\" said Semadeni, sighing. \"She jumped on the train and left for anywhere but here. Understand, this is not only a job. It's a lifestyle being up here.\"\nThere are also problems with the line's supply chain. Everything served in the restaurant for 10 months a year (the hotel closes in November and for one month after Easter) arrives by train, and the sublime location doesn't always compensate for things not arriving on time. Appropriately, while we chatted, Semadeni was awaiting a delivery of prosciutto crudo.\nThese are mountains that are full of peril – avalanches, landslides, glacial crevasses, thunderstorms and rockfalls. Clearly, running out of Italian ham is one of the more manageable hardships.\n\"Of course, but I can't go anywhere else to get it,\" smiled Semadeni, his mood brightening. \"And if I forget to order bread, we don't have any either. Some winter days, that's OK as we have no guests. But when the sun shines, 60 or more people can show up.\"\nSemadeni's other complaint – perhaps most annoying of all – is the days when the line is closed, of which he has experienced many. Happily, the service has only been interrupted once this year. No mountain monk, Semadeni likes the rhythm of new arrivals.\nAlp Grüm is, without doubt, an unsung Swiss landmark – and there is splendour everywhere. An Alpine garden of lady's mantle, edelweiss, lemon balm and peppermint blooms in summer. In winter, the high ground seems to close in at night, in collusion with the stars. And when the last train leaves for the day, there is an almost unattainable silence.\nI was glad I'd visited. It'd been a trip into a part of Switzerland so few see. There is only nature, Semadeni had said. Stillness and nothing more.\nIt was very easy to see what he meant.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

I've been to the area many times – to measure my experience of Switzerland at its wildest against that of the pioneers of winter sports tourism – but this time I was in comfort, on board the Bernina Express and travelling south from Chur, the oldest town in Switzerland.\nThe story of Alp Grüm started in 1906 with Bernina-Bahngesellschaft, a visionary rail company that unveiled an ambitious plan for an electrified train connecting Switzerland with Italy beneath a roll and tumble of mountains and glaciers. What made the idea so extraordinary was that it would become the Alps' highest rail crossing, prising open the area for tourists but also slashing travel time for traders; back then, it took horse-riding messengers nine hours to complete the dangerous journey between Samedan and Tirano. The struggle was intensified in winter due to avalanche risk and the possibility of becoming stranded by heavy snowfall.\nTo say Switzerland did not have precedent for this sort of engineering project would be to engage in understatement. Thirty years prior in 1888, Dutch hotelier Willem Jan Holsboer founded the nearby Landquart-Davos narrow-gauge railway. The town of Davos is best known for the World Economic Forum, but its roots are as a spa town, and Holsboer capitalised by way of bringing more visitors to the resort than the horse-drawn carriages did. No less of a marvel before that was the opening of the Gotthard Railway from Immensee to Chiasso in 1882, featuring what was then the world's longest rail tunnel.\nIt was against this background, on a sunny day in July 1910, that the Bernina Line was opened and Alp Grüm began life – not as a stone-built, 10-room hotel and waiting room as it is today, but as a timber cabin, from where the station chief could check the line every morning. \nThe Rhaetian Railway took control of the Bernina Line in 1943, and the idea, as company spokesperson Camille Härdi describes it, was simply \"a rest stop\" – a notion that is hard to believe today.\n\"The Bernina Line wasn't even originally supposed to operate all year round,\" Härdi said. \"However, the railway's management board decided in 1910 – once the line to Tirano had been finished – to acquire a snow plough. It first came into use in the winter of 1910/11 and proved to be a wondrous piece of technology, capable of cutting the considerable costs normally associated with snow-clearing.\"\nThese days, the Bernina Line rarely, if ever, closes, meaning Alp Grüm is no longer the Shangri-La it once was. \"Winter has changed over the years with the glaciers receding and global warming,\" said Härdi. \"Even so, it still happens there is plenty of snow. There's a locomotive called a 'Snow Blower' that makes sure the train runs even after a heavy snowfall.\"\nImagine the excitement of trainspotters today: the Unesco World Heritage-listed Bernina Line is home to the world's only self-propelled, steam-powered snow plough locomotive.\n \nBut plenty of the original impulse to build Alp Grüm survives. The geometry of the glaciers and lakes remains impeccably beautiful, and when I arrived, I was immediately transfixed by the Palü Glacier and the blue-green Lago Palü at its terminus.\nAbove was Ospizio Bernina, the Alps' highest rail crossing at 2,253m. Far below, looking down towards Valposchiavo, the serpentine curve of the tracks switch-backed down a steeply pitched slope. Foregrounding that, the station, remodelled in stone in 1923, was gloriously isolated. It had the air of an Italian villa transferred to a mountaintop, with pizzoccheri (flat short buckwheat noodles) the specialty of its platform restaurant. \nMore like this:• Europe's stunning high-tech luxury train• A new night train connecting some of Europe's great cities• The Train d'Artouste: Europe's highest narrow-gauge train\nThe hardest part about living at Alp Grüm, according to Semadeni, who has spent 18 years here, is the unpredictability each day brings. And to put it mildly, it was one of those days. \"This morning, one of my waitresses quit,\" said Semadeni, sighing. \"She jumped on the train and left for anywhere but here. Understand, this is not only a job. It's a lifestyle being up here.\"\nThere are also problems with the line's supply chain. Everything served in the restaurant for 10 months a year (the hotel closes in November and for one month after Easter) arrives by train, and the sublime location doesn't always compensate for things not arriving on time. Appropriately, while we chatted, Semadeni was awaiting a delivery of prosciutto crudo.\nThese are mountains that are full of peril – avalanches, landslides, glacial crevasses, thunderstorms and rockfalls. Clearly, running out of Italian ham is one of the more manageable hardships.\n\"Of course, but I can't go anywhere else to get it,\" smiled Semadeni, his mood brightening. \"And if I forget to order bread, we don't have any either. Some winter days, that's OK as we have no guests. But when the sun shines, 60 or more people can show up.\"\nSemadeni's other complaint – perhaps most annoying of all – is the days when the line is closed, of which he has experienced many. Happily, the service has only been interrupted once this year. No mountain monk, Semadeni likes the rhythm of new arrivals.\nAlp Grüm is, without doubt, an unsung Swiss landmark – and there is splendour everywhere. An Alpine garden of lady's mantle, edelweiss, lemon balm and peppermint blooms in summer. In winter, the high ground seems to close in at night, in collusion with the stars. And when the last train leaves for the day, there is an almost unattainable silence.\nI was glad I'd visited. It'd been a trip into a part of Switzerland so few see.

{"id": 367, "question": "In what year did the Bernina Line open?", "answer": ["1910"], "doc": ["Trains operating on the Bernina line include the Bernina Express. In the year following the completion of the Albula railway line in 1904, the Bernina-Bahngesellschaft (BB) was established, with the objective of opening a railway line between St Moritz and Tirano, via the Bernina Pass.", "Thus, the section from Pontresina to Tirano forms part of the route of the Bernina Express. In October 2011, it was the first railway line in the world to be photographed and put on Google Street View.[3][4][5] St Moritz is the terminus of both the Albula line and the Bernina line.", "htm Even in June, when we took the Bernina Express, it was the closed panoramic cars, which means large windows that go up to the ceiling, but still cause reflection. At the end of each car, there an area where you can open a window to put your arms and camera outside, and got great video of the train going around the figure 8 Brusio viaduct.", "We road the Bernina Express early March 2017, so open panoramic cars were not an option. That said, the end car back entryway had an operable window that could be opened. Note that the rail track runs down some narrow streets where I didn't really want to stick my head out of the window.", "In Poschiavo it finally meets up once again with the Bernina Pass road. At the request of the Poschiavo community, the station at Poschiavo was built just outside the village boundaries. It has a railway depot and workshop, in which a few historic railcars of the Bernina line are also stored.", "While Switzerland is full of Alpine huts and hard-to-reach hotels, Alp Grüm is a mountain anomaly like no other.\n\"Happily, there are no roads. There is only nature. Sunrises. Sunsets. Stillness. Nothing more, \" Primo Semadeni, the 57-year-old manager of Alp Grüm hotel in Graubünden, told me as we stood overlooking a high-altitude pass covered in perpetual snow. The soundtrack was whispering wind, singing birds and rushing water as a river tumbled down the valley.\n\"Look around, we have mountains and glaciers and are far from everyday life. This is a challenge, but also our blessing.\" \nHard-to-reach hotels and huts are a Swiss specialty, with many preserved as monuments to Alpine history. The Jungfrau Region, within the snow-ruffled reaches of the Bernese Alps, is for lofty shelters in the car-free villages of Mürren, Wengen and Kleine Scheidegg, where accommodation can only be accessed by ski lift, cable car or cogwheel train. These are places of meditation, where hikers wander and the mind slows.\nThen there is an alphabet of striking refuges hidden in mountain eyries, from the Appenzell Alps to Zermatt. Great St Bernard Hospice in Valais is a remarkable example, requiring a continual push by snowshoe in winter, or a high-altitude access road, which only opens to traffic after the thaw.\nBut Alp Grüm, straddling a razor-edge ridge on the south side of the Bernina Pass at 2,091m, pushes such extremes to the limits. It is caught between languages, with the immediate north speaking Romansh and the valley below Italian. There is no road to it beneath Piz Bernina, the highest peak of the Eastern Alps. And the only way to get there year-round is to hike in for hours – not recommended in winter – or take the Rhaetian Railway that climbs high between the little towns of Pontresina and Poschiavo near the Italian border.\nWhat's more, the hotel's identity is wholly drawn from the history of the rail company, and it doubles as train station, platform and waiting room.

Born and raised in the Bronx borough of New York City, Dean initially embarked on his musical career as a DJ.", "Karim Kharbouch, known by his stage name, French Montana, was born and raised in Morocco, growing up in the country’s predominantly Islamic culture until the age of 13 when he and his family emigrated to the United States. The rap star made his debut in the hip hop world in 2007, securing his spot as one of the biggest names right off the bat.", "” In the adorable snaps, Genesis stood beside Keys with his hands in his pockets, keeping a watchful eye on the crowd. “He heard how people been acting at shows lately,” Swizz Beatz wrote above the first picture in the slideshow. “My boy serious in real life.” Swizz Beatz continued to joke about his son’s demeanor on stage in the caption.", "[36] In July 2011, Swizz Beatz said instead of releasing all of the songs at once, he would release the tracks over an extended period of time: \"Let me clarify: Haute Living is still coming, but as far as releasing all on one day, I'm not doing that no more,\" he said.", "[66] In 2010, Dean became involved in the design and launch of the Aston Martin Rapide. In 2011, Swizz Beatz became the official face of Lotus cars until CEO Dany Bahar left the company. Subsequently, Swizz Beatz returned to Aston Martin for 2013.", "Long closed to the outside world, this ancient city is now revealing its secrets. From hot air ballooning to stargazing, here are Swizz Beatz's picks in one of his favourite places.\nThroughout his 25-year career, the celebrity – whose real name is Kasseem Daoud Dean – has worn many hats: entertainer, DJ, producer, art buyer, fashion designer and husband to fellow musician Alicia Keys.\nAnd in 2020, the Bronx-born Dean made history as the first American owner of a Saudi Arabian camel racing team.\nThe move may have surprised fans, but anyone close to Dean knows about his decades-long love for Saudi Arabia – a passion inherited from his grandfather, who completed the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in 1978. The Grammy winner himself is a practicing Muslim and visits the kingdom regularly.\n\"It was nowhere near as developed as it is today,\" he says, recalling his first visit in 2006. \"But you can feel the energy. You can feel the culture, you can feel the craft.\"\nDean has travelled all over the nation; lately, most often to the ancient city of AlUla – a dramatic desert valley oasis in north-western Saudi Arabia's Hijaz region that has, until recently, been closed to visitors. Despite being the site of the Unesco-listed Hegra, the secondary hub of the region's ancient Nabataean civilisation, it wasn't until 2019 that the Saudi government began issuing tourist visas for non-religious travel, finally allowing travellers to experience the splendour of AlUla's 900-year-old Old Town and its otherworldly sandstone and granite mountain landscapes, as part of a $1tn Saudi government initiative to revamp tourism throughout the nation.\nDean has been there every step of the way.\n\"My relationship with AlUla is like seeing a seed planted in the ground and watching a beautiful flower grow,\" says Dean, who was among the first invited to watch the construction of the city's massive Maraya performance venue – a mirror-clad behemoth rising out of the desert sands – and eco-friendly luxury accommodation resorts like Our Habitas. \"Seeing the vision coming to life in front of my eyes has been magical to watch.\"\nDean has \"lost count\" of his visits, but \"every month is something new. It's amazing to see a place thriving off of innovation, arts, creativity and music\".\nAlong with Keys, Dean has worked tirelessly to improve AlUla's cultural scene; helming and DJing at AlUla on Wheels, an immersive open-air skating rink in the AlJadidah Arts District and cheering on his camel racing team, Saudi Bronx, at the yearly AlUla Cup. \"[My] camel racing team is a homage to the desert,\" he explains. \"People [here] know me for camel racing more than my music.\"\nHere are Dean's favourite ways to experience AlUla.\nIn reintroducing itself to the world, AlUla's art galleries now attract international talent and its yearly Wellness Festival features a five-day immersive \"sanctuary\" retreat and celebrity-led wellness experiences like yoga and sound baths. But to get a real feel for the city, \"I would go to the Old Town out the gate,\" declares Dean. \"It gives you the history of AlUla. It's quite a unique area because they're actually rebuilding the entire Old Town.\n \nAlUla's Old Town – a dazzling honeycomb of low-roofed mudbrick buildings – dates to the 12th Century CE, when it was a key settlement on the pilgrimage between Damascus and Mecca. The site, crowned by a 45m-high fortress and hemmed in by 14 gates, was largely abandoned in the 20th Century. Today boutiques, art galleries and cafes have taken over its ancient dwellings.\n\"When you go there you can see how they build the mud houses, from back in the days until how it's gonna be in the future. You get to see the future of it and still go have a Michelin-star dinner right next door,\" says Dean. \"They're keeping the structures old but with new materials and then, you know, in one of those structures you'll see, like, a Bergdorf.\" He adds, \"It's pretty modern in that sense… It's not like 'damn, I got to take a camel to the store.'\"\nAlUla, nestled in the vast AlUla Valley, is surrounded by a seemingly endless expanse of swirling red sand dotted by russet-coloured mountains, sand dunes and wadis. At night, its skies are famously pitch black.\n\"When you go outside at night it's like you can touch the stars from your porch,\" says Dean. \"It almost feels like you're on Mars because the rocks are so big, and you're surrounded by so much gentle strength.\"\nFor Dean, \"the entire desert experience\" – arranged by his go-to luxury resort Our Habitas – makes a great cultural introduction to AlUla. \"You're in the tent and you have the Saudi coffee and you have the bread and the food and the herbs and the fire's burning,\" he says. \"Usually, they'll have an oud player. It's amazing. You can sleep out there or just make a dinner reservation. They put on a whole show, fire dancing and dancing to the Arabic music and showing you how to cook local dishes.\"\nAlong with desert glamping and dining experiences offered by Our Habitas and Banyan Tree AlUla, wild camping is also possible in AlUla; there are two free authorised camping sites, as well as 10 large-scale campsites including Pangaea Adventure Club. Dressing in layers is recommended, as is safe, responsible camping behaviour, like maintaining a clean campsite and leaving the desert vegetation and wildlife untouched. \n\"I've never seen the constellations so clear as in AlUla,\" says Dean. \"When I'm in AlUla I can hear myself think. It's an amazing place to go rejuvenate, an amazing place to try new things.\"\nWebsite: https://www.ourhabitas.com/caravan-alula/\nWith so many new visitors arriving each month, AlUla's food scene now brims with international eateries ranging from sushi bars to hamburger joints. But \"of the local foods, [I highly recommend] a kabsa\", says Dean – citing a traditional Arabian dish of spiced rice and meat, often chicken, camel, fish or lamb. \"It takes a little while to cook but when you get it, it's worth every bite. They cook the lamb very well to where the meat is very [tender]. And they mix it with this rice and it all comes in this pot. You can share with multiple people. The rice has all these herbs and different things in it. Some have different mixes, some are more spicy than others. So tasting multiple kabsas… you're never going to lose with that.\"\nWhen asked to pick a favourite restaurant in town, Dean is hard-pressed. \"You could pick any restaurant. You could pick any hotel. The food is outrageous,\" he says. \"You can tell the people have the passion. I love when a place is so unique that everybody has pride in with it. It's not so rushed. The love is there. The craft is there. What I love about Alula is that the craft is there.\"\nWith its stunning mountains and unique rock formations like Elephant Rock, AlUla has a lot to offer outdoor adventurers. But Dean has special love for the AlUla Skies Festival, a spectacular 10-day autumn event celebrating the city's magnificent skies, from stargazing to Dean's favourite, hot air balloon rides.\n\"That is unbelievable,\" he says. \"I'm not a big fan of hot air balloons. But when I went in AlUla it was just something different. They didn't go too high; I'm a little scared of heights. Ours was at a pretty amazing level where you can go over the Old Town and go over the beautiful landscapes. Seeing where the oasis meets the desert is pretty unique.\"\nDuring the festival, up to 60 hot air balloons lazily circle the sky in both tethered and untethered flights, taking in the sweeping views of Hegra, the Old Town and the endless expanses of desert sand. Participants can also charter helicopter rides, and for those who'd rather stay closer to the ground, there are meditation sessions and cooking classes under the stars.\n5. Best place to learn about the past: Hegra \n\"Hegra is a must, must, must,\" says Dean.\nThere are more than 27,000 archaeological sites in AlUla dating to the late prehistoric period (5200-1200 BCE), but Hegra, also known as Mada'in Saleh, is the most well-known. Inhabited since the 1st Century BCE – and a thriving incense and trading hub until the 12th Century – Hegra is the site of a 1.6-hectare necropolis complex containing 111 boulder-cut monumental decorated and inscribed tombs, beautifully preserved by the arid desert conditions. It was named a Unesco World Heritage site in 2008; Saudi Arabia's first World Heritage property.\n\"You see the structure and the condition and the masterpiece, the masterful architects that built these things way, way, way, way back,\" says Dean. \"It's magical to see.\"\nWhile in Hegra, visitors can opt for an organised bus tour to the ancient city of Dadan and Jabal Ikmah, a 9th-Century BCE \"open-air library\" containing the world's largest concentration of Lihyanite and Dadanitic rock inscriptions, or set off on the Oasis Heritage Trail; a 3km palm-tree shaded walking tour through the AlUla Oasis.\n\"You just have to go to AlUla, period!\" says Dean.\nWebsite: https://www.experiencealula.com/en/plan-your-trip/alula-visitor-centres\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

But \"of the local foods, [I highly recommend] a kabsa\", says Dean – citing a traditional Arabian dish of spiced rice and meat, often chicken, camel, fish or lamb. \"It takes a little while to cook but when you get it, it's worth every bite. They cook the lamb very well to where the meat is very [tender]. And they mix it with this rice and it all comes in this pot. You can share with multiple people. The rice has all these herbs and different things in it. Some have different mixes, some are more spicy than others. So tasting multiple kabsas… you're never going to lose with that.\"\nWhen asked to pick a favourite restaurant in town, Dean is hard-pressed. \"You could pick any restaurant. You could pick any hotel. The food is outrageous,\" he says. \"You can tell the people have the passion. I love when a place is so unique that everybody has pride in with it. It's not so rushed. The love is there. The craft is there. What I love about Alula is that the craft is there.\"\nWith its stunning mountains and unique rock formations like Elephant Rock, AlUla has a lot to offer outdoor adventurers. But Dean has special love for the AlUla Skies Festival, a spectacular 10-day autumn event celebrating the city's magnificent skies, from stargazing to Dean's favourite, hot air balloon rides.\n\"That is unbelievable,\" he says. \"I'm not a big fan of hot air balloons. But when I went in AlUla it was just something different. They didn't go too high; I'm a little scared of heights. Ours was at a pretty amazing level where you can go over the Old Town and go over the beautiful landscapes. Seeing where the oasis meets the desert is pretty unique.\"\nDuring the festival, up to 60 hot air balloons lazily circle the sky in both tethered and untethered flights, taking in the sweeping views of Hegra, the Old Town and the endless expanses of desert sand.

From hot air ballooning to stargazing, here are Swizz Beatz's picks in one of his favourite places.\nThroughout his 25-year career, the celebrity – whose real name is Kasseem Daoud Dean – has worn many hats: entertainer, DJ, producer, art buyer, fashion designer and husband to fellow musician Alicia Keys.\nAnd in 2020, the Bronx-born Dean made history as the first American owner of a Saudi Arabian camel racing team.\nThe move may have surprised fans, but anyone close to Dean knows about his decades-long love for Saudi Arabia – a passion inherited from his grandfather, who completed the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in 1978. The Grammy winner himself is a practicing Muslim and visits the kingdom regularly.\n\"It was nowhere near as developed as it is today,\" he says, recalling his first visit in 2006. \"But you can feel the energy. You can feel the culture, you can feel the craft.\"\nDean has travelled all over the nation; lately, most often to the ancient city of AlUla – a dramatic desert valley oasis in north-western Saudi Arabia's Hijaz region that has, until recently, been closed to visitors. Despite being the site of the Unesco-listed Hegra, the secondary hub of the region's ancient Nabataean civilisation, it wasn't until 2019 that the Saudi government began issuing tourist visas for non-religious travel, finally allowing travellers to experience the splendour of AlUla's 900-year-old Old Town and its otherworldly sandstone and granite mountain landscapes, as part of a $1tn Saudi government initiative to revamp tourism throughout the nation.\nDean has been there every step of the way.\n\"My relationship with AlUla is like seeing a seed planted in the ground and watching a beautiful flower grow,\" says Dean, who was among the first invited to watch the construction of the city's massive Maraya performance venue – a mirror-clad behemoth rising out of the desert sands – and eco-friendly luxury accommodation resorts like Our Habitas. \"Seeing the vision coming to life in front of my eyes has been magical to watch.\"\nDean has \"lost count\" of his visits, but \"every month is something new. It's amazing to see a place thriving off of innovation, arts, creativity and music\".\nAlong with Keys, Dean has worked tirelessly to improve AlUla's cultural scene; helming and DJing at AlUla on Wheels, an immersive open-air skating rink in the AlJadidah Arts District and cheering on his camel racing team, Saudi Bronx, at the yearly AlUla Cup. \"[My] camel racing team is a homage to the desert,\" he explains. \"People [here] know me for camel racing more than my music.\"\nHere are Dean's favourite ways to experience AlUla.\nIn reintroducing itself to the world, AlUla's art galleries now attract international talent and its yearly Wellness Festival features a five-day immersive \"sanctuary\" retreat and celebrity-led wellness experiences like yoga and sound baths. But to get a real feel for the city, \"I would go to the Old Town out the gate,\" declares Dean. \"It gives you the history of AlUla. It's quite a unique area because they're actually rebuilding the entire Old Town.\n \nAlUla's Old Town – a dazzling honeycomb of low-roofed mudbrick buildings – dates to the 12th Century CE, when it was a key settlement on the pilgrimage between Damascus and Mecca. The site, crowned by a 45m-high fortress and hemmed in by 14 gates, was largely abandoned in the 20th Century.

It’s more than just a cycling trail, though, it’s an invitation to experience local culture, cuisine, and to intimately connect with a stunning natural landscape. Bri and I on the Véloroute Gourmande.", "Launched in April 2022, the Véloroute Gourmande passes more than 100 culinary stops, from farmers' markets and vineyards to casual pubs and elegant farm-to-table restaurants, as it threads through the region's bucolic villages and lake-laced landscape.", "For years, I’d heard that, with all of that in mind, I had to ride the Véloroute Gourmande — and when Bri and I got the chance to do just that, it was a dream come true. The Véloroute Gourmande is an ambitious cycling route that takes time to cover, but it’s accessible for riders of all skill levels.", "Cyclists can now plan their trip by visiting the website veloroutegourmande.com. The general public will also be able to learn more about the Véloroute Gourmande at the Montréal Bicycle Show from April 29 to May 1 at the Olympic Stadium, and at Salon Info-Vélo de Québec at Centre de glaces Intact Assurance, from May 6 to 8.", "Photo Credit: Christopher Mitchell The joy of riding the Véloroute Gourmande was two-fold. On the one hand, it’s a physical test, and a rewarding one at that.", "Launched in 2022, the path threads Québec's bucolic villages and lake-laced landscapes, passing more than 100 culinary stops from Montréal to Sherbrooke.\nOnce, in 2019 – uncomfortably perched on a borrowed, oversized bike – I rode 42km on a windswept, gravel causeway built atop an old train line that cuts through the waters of New England's Lake Champlain. \nBased on that experience, and a leisurely 32km pedal near my Vermont home recently, I decided to hop on a Greyhound bus to Montréal with my sister, a more experienced biker, and spend five days tackling the Véloroute Gourmande: a 235km paved and gravel cycling trail connecting Montréal and the city of Sherbrooke in southern Québec.\nThat's how I found myself sopping wet from unrelenting rain, wearing padded bike shorts beneath running tights, multiple shirts under a rain jacket and dripping onto the wooden floorboards of one of the most charming coffee shops I've ever entered, Yamaska Café in Farnham, Québec. I'm not yet an intermediate rider, but I'm certainly a stubborn beginner. And a hungry one.\nLuckily, I was – quite literally – on the right track. Launched in April 2022, the Véloroute Gourmande passes more than 100 culinary stops, from farmers' markets and vineyards to casual pubs and elegant farm-to-table restaurants, as it threads through the region's bucolic villages and lake-laced landscape. As a food writer, goose farmer, cooking teacher and restaurant chef, I was keen to turn my attention from the woods where I forage for wild mushrooms and my garden, which abounds with heirloom tomatoes, uncommon herbs and edible flowers, north to explore the culinary heritage of the Québecois countryside. \nMuch of the trail follows a portion of the Route Verte, whose 5,300km crisscross Québec and comprise the longest network of cycling paths in North America. But aside from its length, the main difference between the two routes is that the Véloroute Gourmande was essentially designed as a slow travel food tour. While pedalling across Québec's countryside, cyclists can stop to refuel on gravy-slicked French fries, tarts filled with blueberry jam, coffee gussied up with maple syrup or booze flavoured with boreal herbs, forest mushrooms or wildflowers.\nThe Véloroute's interactive map features 120 icons – including tiny forks, beer glasses and squat jam jars – that denote places to stop for things like golden panini stuffed with house-cured ham and bloomy rind cheese, dark ale delicately scented with spruce tips or wedges of cheese to squash into one's panniers and nosh by the side of the road.\nDespite its name, this \"Gourmande\" trail isn't merely culinary. Organisers also offer suggestions on elegant hotels and charming B&Bs, culturally important sites – such as a Le Vieux Clocher concert hall in Magog and a defunct copper mine that offers underground tours – and every bike shop along the way, in case your derailleur gets derailed on the rail trail.\nAlthough it's possible to tackle the route in either direction, the Véloroute website suggests starting in Montréal and riding east. Given that Montréal is the most likely arrival point for out-of-towners and the biking closest to the city is easiest (read: flatter), allowing cyclists to build up to the longer, hillier days, this makes good sense. Riding east also provides a better chance at a tailwind, although it does increase the climbing by 150m.\nThe initial segment, a 45km pedal from Montréal to the city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, contains 55 of the route's 120 culinary pit stops. In order to pack in more dining, we gave ourselves an extra day to cover the first leg.\nAs a chef, I've typically planned my travels around culinary explorations. Over time, I've developed strategies for sniffing out the finest fare, from comforting and casual to exquisite. However, I've never before been limited to the places I could get to with only pedal power.\nI narrowed down the options in two ways. First, I eliminated places that would be closed when I passed by, including farmers' markets that are open for just four hours per week. Next, I looked for stops that highlight the best of what Québec has to offer, ignoring otherwise appealing ramen shops and Italian restaurants. The region's modern cuisine leans heavily on its French-occupied history – think buttery pastries, French onion soup and crêpes rolled around sweet or savoury fillings. These items are complemented by fare that might be fit to take along while logging or fur trapping, such as long-lasting hard cheeses and charcuterie, and spiced meat hand pies.\nAs a rule, restaurants with massive menus often rely on frozen and premade goods, so I nixed those, even if they tantalised with mentions of Québecois fare such as poutine, steak or salmon tartare or custard-y maple syrup pie. Briefer menus that mentioned the use of local or seasonal ingredients, and featured those same classic items, made the list.\nOnce I had my itinerary, we set out. Biking east, we travelled along the mighty St Lawrence River, passing decaying factories, building-sized cruise ships and the two islands that make up Parc Jean-Drapeau, which features a ferris wheel, a geodesic dome that looks like a massive soap bubble and Montréal's slick Formula 1 racing circuit.\nThe first two days were marked by easy riding and a mix of urban and suburban scenery. We got caught in a two-wheeled traffic jam as we waited for a drawbridge to close, skirted a tiny airport and pedalled past schools and numerous sculpture parks. One exception was in the town of Chambly, 29km east of Montréal. The town's quaint main drag was lined with Véloroute-recommended stops, making it easy to sip a latte, sample chocolate truffles, eat house-smoked pork ribs and visit Chambly's famous stalwart stone fortress-turned-museum with just a modicum of effort.\nIn Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, which had a grittier vibe, we found our first épiceries (small neighbourhood grocery stores that often double as cafes). At one, a local farmer had set up tables on the porch to sell both summer and winter squash, bundles of greens and late season tomatoes. These all-in-one spots, each with unique character and a distinctive selection of products, would prove a mainstay of our trip.\nMore like this: • Canada's remote bike-in mountain stay • Survivorman Les Stroud takes you on his top five Canadian outdoor adventures • A cutting-edge tourism model in Newfoundland\nOn our third morning, heading towards Granby, the scenery changed dramatically, passing through narrow wooded stretches bordering industrial parks, marshes or farms with sweeping fields of soy and corn. In one spot, the path was littered with ripe golden soybeans that had blown free of their pods in the brisk, manure-scented breeze, and crunched beneath our tyres as we rode.\nAlthough it later poured, that day was redeemed by visits to some of our favourite stops. The boutique vibe at Yamaska Café in Farnham was perfectly curated, with jars of haskap berry jam, bags of locally grown organic lentils and other gourmet products tucked into vintage pieces of furniture. The sandwiches and treats sourced from a pâtisserie a few towns over, including a lush pecan tart with gooey caramel on a chocolate cookie crust and a pistachio mousse cake, were as beautiful as the space.\nAt Absintherie des Cantons, a distillery on the outskirts of Granby, we got to peer at the glistening copper-and-stainless alembic used for distilling gin, then sit at the bar to sample the results. Next, we watched their award-winning green absinthe turn milky as water splashed into it from a $1,200 Art Nouveau fountain. The wormwood and anise-flavoured spirit was potent, but smooth and easy to sip.\nThe final two days of the trip were filled with ideal weather, hilly climbs and gorgeous scenery – complete with deep-blue lakes, grazing cattle and the first fiery autumn leaves. With so many kilometres  to cover (more than 60 each day), stopping frequently seemed unwise, so we stuck to places that offered coffee, meals and desserts in one.\nLuckily, both La Station in Eastman, a café and art gallery packed with fellow bikers, and Massawippi Mercantile in North Hatley, had delicious food, spacious dining areas and particularly friendly staff.\nThe evening of our fifth day, we arrived in the city of Sherbrooke, a little tired but surprisingly, still very hungry. Our trip had its ups and downs, mostly literal ones, but as a novice biker and a veteran eater, I can't imagine a better first foray into the world of bikepacking than the Véloroute Gourmande. Not only did I get to sample foie gras pȃté with massive local blueberries, sip gin scented with sea buckthorn and spread local cranberry compote on my pancakes, I also got to test my mettle by pedalling through the bucolic Canadian landscape from which the ingredients came. Next time, though, I'll bring fewer clothes, and leave more room in my packs for fromage.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

These items are complemented by fare that might be fit to take along while logging or fur trapping, such as long-lasting hard cheeses and charcuterie, and spiced meat hand pies.\nAs a rule, restaurants with massive menus often rely on frozen and premade goods, so I nixed those, even if they tantalised with mentions of Québecois fare such as poutine, steak or salmon tartare or custard-y maple syrup pie. Briefer menus that mentioned the use of local or seasonal ingredients, and featured those same classic items, made the list.\nOnce I had my itinerary, we set out. Biking east, we travelled along the mighty St Lawrence River, passing decaying factories, building-sized cruise ships and the two islands that make up Parc Jean-Drapeau, which features a ferris wheel, a geodesic dome that looks like a massive soap bubble and Montréal's slick Formula 1 racing circuit.\nThe first two days were marked by easy riding and a mix of urban and suburban scenery. We got caught in a two-wheeled traffic jam as we waited for a drawbridge to close, skirted a tiny airport and pedalled past schools and numerous sculpture parks. One exception was in the town of Chambly, 29km east of Montréal. The town's quaint main drag was lined with Véloroute-recommended stops, making it easy to sip a latte, sample chocolate truffles, eat house-smoked pork ribs and visit Chambly's famous stalwart stone fortress-turned-museum with just a modicum of effort.\nIn Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, which had a grittier vibe, we found our first épiceries (small neighbourhood grocery stores that often double as cafes). At one, a local farmer had set up tables on the porch to sell both summer and winter squash, bundles of greens and late season tomatoes. These all-in-one spots, each with unique character and a distinctive selection of products, would prove a mainstay of our trip.\nMore like this: • Canada's remote bike-in mountain stay • Survivorman Les Stroud takes you on his top five Canadian outdoor adventures • A cutting-edge tourism model in Newfoundland\nOn our third morning, heading towards Granby, the scenery changed dramatically, passing through narrow wooded stretches bordering industrial parks, marshes or farms with sweeping fields of soy and corn. In one spot, the path was littered with ripe golden soybeans that had blown free of their pods in the brisk, manure-scented breeze, and crunched beneath our tyres as we rode.\nAlthough it later poured, that day was redeemed by visits to some of our favourite stops. The boutique vibe at Yamaska Café in Farnham was perfectly curated, with jars of haskap berry jam, bags of locally grown organic lentils and other gourmet products tucked into vintage pieces of furniture. The sandwiches and treats sourced from a pâtisserie a few towns over, including a lush pecan tart with gooey caramel on a chocolate cookie crust and a pistachio mousse cake, were as beautiful as the space.\nAt Absintherie des Cantons, a distillery on the outskirts of Granby, we got to peer at the glistening copper-and-stainless alembic used for distilling gin, then sit at the bar to sample the results. Next, we watched their award-winning green absinthe turn milky as water splashed into it from a $1,200 Art Nouveau fountain. The wormwood and anise-flavoured spirit was potent, but smooth and easy to sip.\nThe final two days of the trip were filled with ideal weather, hilly climbs and gorgeous scenery – complete with deep-blue lakes, grazing cattle and the first fiery autumn leaves. With so many kilometres  to cover (more than 60 each day), stopping frequently seemed unwise, so we stuck to places that offered coffee, meals and desserts in one.\nLuckily, both La Station in Eastman, a café and art gallery packed with fellow bikers, and Massawippi Mercantile in North Hatley, had delicious food, spacious dining areas and particularly friendly staff.\nThe evening of our fifth day, we arrived in the city of Sherbrooke, a little tired but surprisingly, still very hungry.

{"id": 373, "question": "What is the total length of the Véloroute Gourmande?", "answer": ["235km"], "doc": ["The Véloroute Gourmande is a nearly 250 kilometre cycling route that stretches across the Eastern Townships & Montérégie in Quebec. It’s more than just a cycling trail, though, it’s an invitation to experience local culture, cuisine, and to intimately connect with a stunning natural landscape. Bri and I on the Véloroute Gourmande.", "4 distinct sections, one incredible journey. This section is 45 kilometres in length, with a total of 307 metres of elevation, and is noted as “easy,” at least comparatively speaking. You’ll find both paved and unpaved sections, as with all 4 sections of the Véloroute Gourmande. You’ll kick things off from Montréal.", "Much of the trail follows a portion of the Route Verte, whose 5,300km crisscross Québec and comprise the longest network of cycling paths in North America. But aside from its length, the main difference between the two routes is that the Véloroute Gourmande was essentially designed as a slow travel food tour.", "For years, I’d heard that, with all of that in mind, I had to ride the Véloroute Gourmande — and when Bri and I got the chance to do just that, it was a dream come true. The Véloroute Gourmande is an ambitious cycling route that takes time to cover, but it’s accessible for riders of all skill levels.", "Given our lack of time, we headed out from Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, cutting out the first 45 kilometres of the route. For our baggage, we decided to go with one of the Véloroute Gourmande partners, Voyager à vélo. They’ll be transporting our bags from one stop to the next, and also shuttle us back to our car at the end of our cyclotourism outing.", "Launched in 2022, the path threads Québec's bucolic villages and lake-laced landscapes, passing more than 100 culinary stops from Montréal to Sherbrooke.\nOnce, in 2019 – uncomfortably perched on a borrowed, oversized bike – I rode 42km on a windswept, gravel causeway built atop an old train line that cuts through the waters of New England's Lake Champlain. \nBased on that experience, and a leisurely 32km pedal near my Vermont home recently, I decided to hop on a Greyhound bus to Montréal with my sister, a more experienced biker, and spend five days tackling the Véloroute Gourmande: a 235km paved and gravel cycling trail connecting Montréal and the city of Sherbrooke in southern Québec.\nThat's how I found myself sopping wet from unrelenting rain, wearing padded bike shorts beneath running tights, multiple shirts under a rain jacket and dripping onto the wooden floorboards of one of the most charming coffee shops I've ever entered, Yamaska Café in Farnham, Québec. I'm not yet an intermediate rider, but I'm certainly a stubborn beginner. And a hungry one.\nLuckily, I was – quite literally – on the right track. Launched in April 2022, the Véloroute Gourmande passes more than 100 culinary stops, from farmers' markets and vineyards to casual pubs and elegant farm-to-table restaurants, as it threads through the region's bucolic villages and lake-laced landscape. As a food writer, goose farmer, cooking teacher and restaurant chef, I was keen to turn my attention from the woods where I forage for wild mushrooms and my garden, which abounds with heirloom tomatoes, uncommon herbs and edible flowers, north to explore the culinary heritage of the Québecois countryside. \nMuch of the trail follows a portion of the Route Verte, whose 5,300km crisscross Québec and comprise the longest network of cycling paths in North America. But aside from its length, the main difference between the two routes is that the Véloroute Gourmande was essentially designed as a slow travel food tour. While pedalling across Québec's countryside, cyclists can stop to refuel on gravy-slicked French fries, tarts filled with blueberry jam, coffee gussied up with maple syrup or booze flavoured with boreal herbs, forest mushrooms or wildflowers.\nThe Véloroute's interactive map features 120 icons – including tiny forks, beer glasses and squat jam jars – that denote places to stop for things like golden panini stuffed with house-cured ham and bloomy rind cheese, dark ale delicately scented with spruce tips or wedges of cheese to squash into one's panniers and nosh by the side of the road.\nDespite its name, this \"Gourmande\" trail isn't merely culinary. Organisers also offer suggestions on elegant hotels and charming B&Bs, culturally important sites – such as a Le Vieux Clocher concert hall in Magog and a defunct copper mine that offers underground tours – and every bike shop along the way, in case your derailleur gets derailed on the rail trail.\nAlthough it's possible to tackle the route in either direction, the Véloroute website suggests starting in Montréal and riding east. Given that Montréal is the most likely arrival point for out-of-towners and the biking closest to the city is easiest (read: flatter), allowing cyclists to build up to the longer, hillier days, this makes good sense. Riding east also provides a better chance at a tailwind, although it does increase the climbing by 150m.\nThe initial segment, a 45km pedal from Montréal to the city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, contains 55 of the route's 120 culinary pit stops. In order to pack in more dining, we gave ourselves an extra day to cover the first leg.\nAs a chef, I've typically planned my travels around culinary explorations. Over time, I've developed strategies for sniffing out the finest fare, from comforting and casual to exquisite. However, I've never before been limited to the places I could get to with only pedal power.\nI narrowed down the options in two ways. First, I eliminated places that would be closed when I passed by, including farmers' markets that are open for just four hours per week. Next, I looked for stops that highlight the best of what Québec has to offer, ignoring otherwise appealing ramen shops and Italian restaurants.

But despite being billed as \"traditionally\" Czech, the dish was adopted from elsewhere.\nIn February 2023, newly-minted United States ambassador to the Czech Republic, Bijan Sabet, uploaded some of his first photos as ambassador to Instagram. The now-deleted post included a couple of shots of cobblestone streets near the US Embassy in Prague and a photo of him holding an ice cream-topped trdelník, a popular tube-shaped pastry.\nThe next day, the Czech press jumped on the photo of the trdelník. \"The first mistake of the new American ambassador\", read the headline in the daily newspaper Mlada Fronta Dnes. Another Czech newspaper, Lidove Noviny, put it in the spectrum of American political scandals by calling it \"TrdelníkGate\". \nSo, what was all the fuss about and how did a pastry cause an international political scandal?\nIf you join the army of tourists in Prague's historical centre, you'll notice that every third or fourth shop – particularly between Old Town Square and Charles Bridge – features 15cm (6in) tubes of dough slowly spinning horizontally on a stick over burning charcoal and a sign above it proclaiming \"Old Czech Specialty\". The scent of caramelised sugar and baked dough wafts from these shops, and at each one, there is often a line out the door.\nMeet the trdelník. Also called \"chimney cakes\", perhaps because they are long-ish and tubular, trdelník gets its name from the stick it slowly spins on as it cooks over coals (trdlo means \"stick\" in Czech).\nWhen I lived in Prague for three years in the 1990s, there were no signs of the trdelník (pronounced: \"ter-del-neek\"). But starting around 2010, I began seeing more and more shops and street stalls selling them. Employees were dressed in historical garb and signs boasted of the pastry's Czech origins. Search for \"Prague\" or \"trdelník\" on TikTok or Instagram and you'll find legions of influencers raving about this \"traditional Czech pastry\".\nThe issue is that the trdelník isn't Czech: it's a sugar-coated riddle wrapped in a doughy mystery inside an ice cream-topped enigma of nebulous origins that tourists appear to love. At the same time, many locals say travellers to their country are being duped into thinking they're indulging in something inherently Czech. On a recent visit to Prague, I decided to try to peel back the flaky dough of the trdelník in order to understand this culinary conundrum and how it came to be a favourite \"old Czech specialty\" among the tourist masses.\nAccording to a Romanian newspaper, the first-known mention of the trdelknik is in a mid-15th-Century manuscript in Heidelberg, Germany. In 1784, it turned up in a cookbook in Transylvania. From there, it seems, the pastry slowly made its way west from Transylvania, anchoring itself throughout Hungary where today it's called kürtöskalács, and eventually finding a warm welcome in the Slovakian town of Skalica. The fact that Skalica became part of Czechoslovakia might partly explain how the pastry ended up catching the attention of Czechs entrepreneurs decades later.\nThe first trdelník shop in the Czech Republic didn't fire up its dough-cooking coals until 2004, when Martin Figura opened a bakery in the country's eastern Moravia region. On his business's website, he claims the pastry comes from Hungary. A year later, another baker, Martin Švarc, opened a trdelník stand in the southern Bohemian tourist town of Česky Krumlov in 2005.\n\"These people inspired me, and I copied their business,\" he told me, referring to the first few people who opened up trdelník bakeries in the country. According to Švarc, trdelník shops started opening in Prague a year or two later. In 2015, someone got the brilliant idea to begin offering a scoop of ice cream on top of the dish and the city's new made-for-tourist dessert was complete. \nBack in Prague, I met up with Janek Rubeš, a journalist whose YouTube channel, the Honest Guide, has 1.4 million subscribers. In his videos, he reveals some local favourites for eating and drinking in Prague, but he has also been very vocal about the trdelník, which has made him the face of anti-trdelník sentiment in his hometown.\nOne of the reasons why the trdelník is so popular with tourists in Prague can be boiled down to a simple and effective marketing technique. \"My mom used to work for an international restaurant chain, and she used to say: if you can smell it and see it from the street, you're likely going to be enticed to try it,\" Rubeš said.  \nRubeš isn't the only Prague resident who is annoyed by the ubiquity of the trdelník and its false association with Czech culinary culture. In December 2022, two theatre students at the  Academy of Performing Arts in Prague made a trdelník-themed project. Anna Hubená, who is studying costume design, created a life-size trdelník costume for Danny Takieddin, an acting student. Scrawled in large letters on the backside of the costume was: \"I AM NOT CZECH TRADITION\". The two of them hit the streets of central Prague as Hubená filmed Takieddin's interactions with tourists. Sometimes the life-size trdelník with legs would be standing next to trdelník-eating tourists – most of whom didn't get the irony, thinking that the plus-sized pastry was actually promoting a trdelník shop. \n\"Mostly only local Czechs appreciated it,\" said Hubená. Takieddin added, \"Even a homeless guy yelled out at us, 'It's from Romania!'\"\nPrague doesn't have a street food tradition. Food here, traditionally consumed in pubs, is meaty, stodgy fare that pairs nicely with a golden-hued pilsner. I can't help but feel that trdelník shop owners are reimagining Czech history for their own financial benefit. The trdelník industry is betting that most visitors to Prague won't have an extensive knowledge of Czech cuisine. Case in point: the American ambassador to the Czech Republic. \"I don’t blame him,\" said Rubeš, of the ambassador's \"TrdelníkGate\" photo. \"If you walk through the centre of Prague and see so many shops selling trdelník, you're going to assume it's a big part of Czech culinary culture.\" \nIt's no coincidence that as tourism numbers have grown in the Czech Republic, so have the number of trdelník shops. In 2003, 20 million foreign travellers visited the nation and there were zero trdelník shops. By 2019, just before Covid restrictions, that number had nearly doubled to 37 million. There are no statistics on the number of trdelník spots in the country, but there is no denying that the trdelník industry has shadowed the rise in tourism.\n\"This is a cautionary tale about how authenticity, when paired with processes of urban touristification, can become a powerful tool for commodification, deceit and appropriation of third-party food traditions – in this case Hungary, Romania and Slovakia,\" said Alessandro Gerosa, a professor of sociology at the University of Milan and author of The Hipster Economy: Taste and Authenticity in Late Modern Capitalism. \"The hostility from local Czechs seems powerless vis-à-vis the pervasiveness of Prague's growing tourism industry.\"\nThe trdelník can be seen as a way to appease travellers seeking out something that appears to be authentically Czech – a sugar-coated symbol of how tourism has transformed the city into something it didn't use to be.   \nJuliana Fischerová, a baker and food writer, said, \"The trdelník likely made its way to Prague because of the festival circuit, such as Christmas markets, which was the only time Czechs would see the pastry up until recent times.\" \nMore like this:• A chicken recipe so good its origin is being fought in court• The English wine that's rivalling Champagne• The underground pasta school in an abandoned Italian ghost town\nFisherová first started seeing trdelník pastries spinning on sticks in Prague about 20 years ago and remembered she had seen the pastry in Slovakia long before that. \"In Prague, it's half the size and twice the price,\" she said. \"The worst crime, though, is that they use very low-quality ingredients at the trdelník shops in Prague. And don't get me started on the quality of the ice cream.\"\nFischerová says that it won’t be long before the pastry enters the canon of Czech cuisine. \"Fried cheese isn't inherently Czech either, but it's been eaten here so long that it's now part of our culinary tradition. [It's] on every pub menu all over the country and, with the exception of Czech food historians, no one questions the authenticity of it.\"\n\"Authenticity\" is a word that popped up over and over in my research on the trdelník. The problem is that \"authenticity\" is a social construct, a subjective term based on a collective perception, so what may seem authentic to one person could feel inauthentic to another.\nThere was an Easter market on Prague's Old Town Square while I was visiting. And to prove Gerosa's point, I asked several trdelník stand employees if the pastry was an authentic Czech product. They all said yes. I then approached a stand selling lángos (fried bread that is indisputably tied to Hungary).\n\"Is lángos an authentic Czech street food?\" I disingenuously asked the woman at the stall. She paused, looked me right in the eye and said, \"Yes. It is traditional Czech street food. Like Czech pizza.\"\nTrdelník purveyors in Prague are engaging in what sociologists call \"impression management\". By evoking an imagined historical community of costume-clad Bohemians cooking the trdelník on a stick over coals, they're not only commodifying the culture of neighbouring nations, but selling visitors a fabricated version of their own. \nBut does any of this really matter when hordes of tourists are literally and figuratively eating up the trdelnik? Is it really that delicious?\nWhen I finished chatting with Rubeš at a cafe in central Prague, we walked out onto the street together. Rubeš spotted a sanitary worker emptying public rubbish bins and asked the worker, \"What is the most common thing that you find in the trash in the centre of Prague?\" The sanitation worker rolled his eyes and said, \"Trdelník. When tourists eat through the ice cream towards the top, they just throw out the fried dough. They barely even eat the thing.\"\nI have to confess that after witnessing the birth and extreme growth of Prague's trdelník industry over the last 20 years, I had never tasted one. So, on my penultimate day in Prague, I purchased a sugar-coated pastry (minus the add-on ice cream) at a stand at the Old Town Square. It was flaky and soft but so bland it was almost tasteless. Like nearly every trdelník-consuming tourist in Prague, I ate about half of it before it got cold and rigor mortis-like, and then tossed the rest of it in the bin. \nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly listed the country where Skalica is located.

Mni Sota (Minnesota) is centered as the birthplace for the Dakota, with Bdote (where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers meet) and Bde Wakan (Spirit Lake, now also known as Lake Mille Lacs) highlighted in Dakota creation stories.", "After spearheading the modern fight for Native American rights, Minneapolis and nearby Saint Paul are experiencing an Indigenous cultural renaissance.\nSouth of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers (known as Bdote, or \"the place where the two rivers meet\"), has been the most sacred site for the Indigenous Dakota people who have called this part of Minnesota home for thousands of years.\n\"Bdote is considered to be the centre of the Earth and the birthplace of the Dakota people,\" said Eden Bart, of the Minnesota Humanities Center. Yet, it also marks the site of one of the most tragic historical events for the area's Native residents.\nIn 1862, facing starvation and displacement by white settlers, a group of Dakota attacked white settlements, setting off a five-week war that led the US government to exile the Dakota from their ancestral homeland and forcibly relocate them to reservations in the Dakotas and Nebraska. That winter, the Dakota were held at Bdote and Fort Snelling, guarded by US troops while waiting for the river to thaw so they could be sent away on boats. The sacred site soon became a mass grave, as hundreds of people died from disease and malnutrition during the winter.\nNearly a century later, following the Indian Relocation Act of 1956 in which Native Americans were incentivised by the US government to relocate from reservations to cities, many Dakota began returning to the area. Now, more than 50 years after activists in Minneapolis spearheaded the modern fight for Native American rights, the Twin Cities are experiencing something of an Indigenous cultural renaissance and are one of the best places to explore modern Native culture in the US today.\nThis cultural revival was inspired by decades of discrimination following the Relocation Act. Mike Forcia, a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, remembers moving with his family to inner-city Saint Paul in 1969. Over the next decade, his family moved back and forth between Saint Paul and the reservation, as his father struggled to hold a stable job. \"As I grew up, I realised many families bounced around and it was not just our family that couldn't make it,\" he said. \"We were told we were free and to assimilate. That was so hard for some of our people, and many turned to drugs and alcohol.\"\nIn addition to the personal trauma and struggle to find footing off the reservation, Indigenous communities faced immense discrimination. \"At the time, Minneapolis' Franklin Avenue, which was the heart of the Indigenous community, was lined with bars,\" said Forcia. \"Police would come and line people up and fill cars with Natives. There were stories of people getting picked up, beaten and thrown by the river.\"\nIn the summer of 1968, roughly 200 members of Minneapolis' Indigenous community gathered to address the police brutality and racial profiling of Native Americans. It was the birth of the American Indian Movement (AIM), which became the driving force behind the modern Indigenous civil rights movement. \"We decided we would no longer be pushed to the margins,\" said Forcia, who now serves as AIM's chairperson.\nIn 1972, AIM representatives occupied the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in Washington DC as part of the Trail of Broken Treaties protests. AIM chapters spread across the US in the 1970s, and members organised protests, provided social services and advocated for the revival of cultural traditions.\nToday, AIM still advocates for Native sovereignty from its Minneapolis headquarters, and prominent local leaders like Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan (White Earth Band of Ojibwe) – the highest-ranking Native American woman elected to executive office in the US – are helping to protect and highlight Indigenous culture. Now, Native artists, chefs, authors, activists and community workers in the Twin Cities are creating spaces of healing, reconciliation and storytelling to restore ancestral traditions.\n\"We're witnessing a Native awakening on a national scale, with unprecedented representation in realms from pop culture to politics,\" noted Kate Nelson a local writer of Tlingit origin. \"Amid this, Minneapolis has emerged as an epicentre for Indigenous creativity, from art to food to music and more.\"\nThe heart of Minneapolis' contemporary Indigenous community is Franklin Avenue East, where a veritable gallery of Native-designed street art is splashed across many of the area's fading buildings. In the parking lot outside the Native American Community Development Institute, a mural by Native American artist Natchez Beaulieu shows Indigenous women celebrating under the night sky filled with constellations and the phases of the moon.\nA few miles west in Minneapolis' Kenwood Park neighbourhood, Birchbark Books is an indie bookstore opened by author Louise Erdrich, who hails from the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, showcasing Native American authors. The store also sells beadwork and red willow baskets, among other crafts by local Indigenous artists, and periodically hosts special events and readings.\nElsewhere, Oglala Lakota Sioux chef and Minneapolis-area local Sean Sherman is one of the most prominent forces helping to revive Native food in the US. Growing up in South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation with little access to Indigenous food, Sherman wanted to learn about and increase the visibility of Native cuisine. In 2015, he founded North American Traditional Indigenous Food Systems (NĀTIFS) to teach farming techniques and nutritional health to Indigenous communities before launching the Indigenous Food Lab. The kitchen and training centre is located in Minneapolis' Midtown Global Market and serves salads, tacos and grain bowls topped with Indigenous staples like slow-cooked bison and the three sisters (corn, beans and squash).\nFor a more immersive dining experience, book a table at Sherman's restaurant, Owamni, which opened in downtown Minneapolis in 2021. A neon sign reading \"You are on Native Land\" greets you as you enter. While the menu shifts with the seasons, one thing remains unchanged: the food is a crucial history lesson, featuring exclusively pre-colonial ingredients with an emphasis on wild game and wild produce. Corn and beans, squash and maple syrup, elk and bison and wild rice and berries – among other ingredients – are crafted into mouthwatering dishes that reflect regional Indigenous traditions. \"We envision a world where we see multiple Indigenous restaurants featuring true regional cultural and culinary diversity,\" said Sherman.\nOwamni overlooks a river of deep importance: Owámniyomni, (\"turbulent waters\" in Dakota), which has been a sacred site of Dakota rituals and treaties for thousands of years. In the early 1870s, the development of the mill industry on the river and a concrete apron built on the falls changed the water's natural flow and desecrated the land and islands around it, including Wíta Wanáǧi, which was a sacred spot for Dakota women to give birth.\nMore like this: • Owamni: A (r)evolution of Indigenous foods • Miami's little-known Indigenous history• The Indigenous tribes reclaiming travel\n\"Land and cultural restoration in Dakota are one and the same.

Yet, it also marks the site of one of the most tragic historical events for the area's Native residents.\nIn 1862, facing starvation and displacement by white settlers, a group of Dakota attacked white settlements, setting off a five-week war that led the US government to exile the Dakota from their ancestral homeland and forcibly relocate them to reservations in the Dakotas and Nebraska. That winter, the Dakota were held at Bdote and Fort Snelling, guarded by US troops while waiting for the river to thaw so they could be sent away on boats. The sacred site soon became a mass grave, as hundreds of people died from disease and malnutrition during the winter.\nNearly a century later, following the Indian Relocation Act of 1956 in which Native Americans were incentivised by the US government to relocate from reservations to cities, many Dakota began returning to the area. Now, more than 50 years after activists in Minneapolis spearheaded the modern fight for Native American rights, the Twin Cities are experiencing something of an Indigenous cultural renaissance and are one of the best places to explore modern Native culture in the US today.\nThis cultural revival was inspired by decades of discrimination following the Relocation Act. Mike Forcia, a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, remembers moving with his family to inner-city Saint Paul in 1969. Over the next decade, his family moved back and forth between Saint Paul and the reservation, as his father struggled to hold a stable job. \"As I grew up, I realised many families bounced around and it was not just our family that couldn't make it,\" he said. \"We were told we were free and to assimilate. That was so hard for some of our people, and many turned to drugs and alcohol.\"\nIn addition to the personal trauma and struggle to find footing off the reservation, Indigenous communities faced immense discrimination. \"At the time, Minneapolis' Franklin Avenue, which was the heart of the Indigenous community, was lined with bars,\" said Forcia. \"Police would come and line people up and fill cars with Natives. There were stories of people getting picked up, beaten and thrown by the river.\"\nIn the summer of 1968, roughly 200 members of Minneapolis' Indigenous community gathered to address the police brutality and racial profiling of Native Americans. It was the birth of the American Indian Movement (AIM), which became the driving force behind the modern Indigenous civil rights movement. \"We decided we would no longer be pushed to the margins,\" said Forcia, who now serves as AIM's chairperson.\nIn 1972, AIM representatives occupied the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in Washington DC as part of the Trail of Broken Treaties protests. AIM chapters spread across the US in the 1970s, and members organised protests, provided social services and advocated for the revival of cultural traditions.\nToday, AIM still advocates for Native sovereignty from its Minneapolis headquarters, and prominent local leaders like Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan (White Earth Band of Ojibwe) – the highest-ranking Native American woman elected to executive office in the US – are helping to protect and highlight Indigenous culture. Now, Native artists, chefs, authors, activists and community workers in the Twin Cities are creating spaces of healing, reconciliation and storytelling to restore ancestral traditions.\n\"We're witnessing a Native awakening on a national scale, with unprecedented representation in realms from pop culture to politics,\" noted Kate Nelson a local writer of Tlingit origin. \"Amid this, Minneapolis has emerged as an epicentre for Indigenous creativity, from art to food to music and more.\"\nThe heart of Minneapolis' contemporary Indigenous community is Franklin Avenue East, where a veritable gallery of Native-designed street art is splashed across many of the area's fading buildings.

Both archaeological findings and oral histories passed down through generations indicate that Indigenous peoples have been inhabiting the area for nearly 6,000 years.\nToday, visitors flock to Winnipeg for its world-renowned museums, festivals, parks and the welcoming spirit reflected in the province's license plate motto: \"Friendly Manitoba\". But for millennia, the area now known as Winnipeg — the city was incorporated and named in 1873 — was a hub where Indigenous nations like the Cree, Ojibwe, Dakota, Ojibwe-Cree and Dene would gather to hold ceremonies, trade goods and share knowledge.\nWe asked Niigaan Sinclair, professor of Indigenous Studies at the University of Manitoba, to tell us the best places where visitors can explore Winnipeg's Indigenous history. For Sinclair, a member of the Anishinaabe (Ojibwa) Nation, Winnipeg remains an epicentre of Indigenous values. And because the city is home to the largest Indigenous population in Canada, where one in five people are Indigenous, he believes it is ground zero for reconciliation between cultures.\n\"Name me a place where reconciliation has been in activity the longest, and it's Manitoba,\" says Sinclair, noting the first of the numbered treaties (Treaty 1) between the Canadian government and Canada's Indigenous people was signed in 1871 at Lower Fort Garry, 20 miles north of Winnipeg. \"I do all the things that I do because I think Winnipeg is a remarkable place.\"\nHere is Sinclair's guide to Indigenous Winnipeg.\nSince being designated a national historic site in 1974, The Forks, a public event space in downtown Winnipeg, has become the city's number-one tourist attraction, welcoming four million visitors a year and hosting a wealth of community celebrations and recreational activities. It's also where extensive archaeological investigations have proved that several Aboriginal groups lived here thousands of years ago.\nCalled the Forks because it's situated at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, the area remains a place of importance to Winnipeg's Indigenous community; in particular the Oodena Celebration Circle where events such as Canada's National Indigenous Peoples Day (21 June), winter and summer solstices, healing ceremonies and the recent National Day of Truth and Reconciliation – more commonly known as Orange Shirt Day (30 September) – are held.\n\"It’s become the Indigenous centre of Winnipeg,\" says Sinclair. \"Anything that happens in the community of significance is often held there … that's why I love it so much.\"\nWebsite: www.theforks.comAddress: Forks Market Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3C 4S8Phone: (204) 927-7874Instagram: @theforkswinnipeg\nThe Métis – one of Canada's three recognised Indigenous peoples – are a distinct Indigenous people with both First Nations and Euro settler (mostly French) ancestry that arose in the late 1700s in Western Canada. Today, it is estimated there are 450,000 Métis Nation citizens in Canada, with approximately 48,000 living in Winnipeg.\nPerhaps the most famous Métis historical figure is Louis Riel, born in Winnipeg's Saint Boniface neighbourhood in 1844. The heart of Manitoba's Francophone community and the Francophone capital of Western Canada, Saint Boniface is located directly across the Red River from the Forks and downtown Winnipeg; accessible by walking across the beautiful Esplanade Riel Footbridge.\nRiel was a central figure in the 1869-70 Red River Resistance that saw Metis people challenge the nascent Canadian government in an ill-fated bid for self-determination. Riel advocated for the culture of the Métis people and challenged Canadian government policies regarding language, religion and land rights, ultimately resulting in his execution for treason in 1885. In 2016, the government of Manitoba recognised Riel as the first leader of Manitoba.\nRiel's gravesite is on the grounds of Saint Boniface Cathedral, built in 1832. \"I spend a lot of time visiting Riel’s grave,\" says Sinclair. \"At least yearly, I go there to pay my respects and lay some tobacco. To understand how Manitoba and Winnipeg came to be, you have to know the story of the Métis and Louis Riel.\"\nWebsite: www.tourismeriel.com/en/Address: 100-219 Provencher Boulevard Winnipeg, Manitoba R2H 0G4Phone: (866) 808-8338Instagram: @tourismeriel\nLocated in the 1,100-acre Assiniboine Park – the largest park in Winnipeg – The Leaf is a horticultural attraction that houses four indoor plant biomes and more than 12,000 trees, shrubs and flowers from around the world. It is home to Canada's tallest indoor waterfall and a beautiful butterfly garden.\nThe Leaf is also where Wab Kinew was sworn in as the first First Nations premier of a province in Canadian history in 2023 during a ceremony that honoured the seven Indigenous nations in Manitoba, along with his 15-member cabinet; eight of whom are people of colour, seven are female or non-binary, five are Indigenous and two are LGBTQ.\n\"It was such a beautiful thing to see,\" Sinclair says. \"The first First Nations premier, the first openly queer deputy premier and the most-ever Indigenous women (two) in cabinet … just amazing.\"\nThe Leaf features five outdoor themed gardens, including the Indigenous Peoples' Garden that was created through a collaborative process involving Indigenous elders, designers and community leaders. Two areas within the garden acknowledge the importance of water and fire, with signage showing translation of \"where the water is\" and \"where the fire is\" in seven Indigenous languages.\nWebsite: www.assiniboinepark.ca/leaf/lifegrows Address: 145 The Leaf Wy., Winnipeg, MB R3P 2N6Phone: (204) 927-6000Instagram: @assiniboine_park\n\"Whenever I do speeches, people always seem to give me gift cards and they're almost always to Feast, which is great.

For Sinclair, a member of the Anishinaabe (Ojibwa) Nation, Winnipeg remains an epicentre of Indigenous values.

{"id": 381, "question": "What is the name of the viral trend where passengers avoid all forms of entertainment and sustenance during long flights?", "answer": ["Raw-dogging"], "doc": ["The latest trend in travel has a vulgar name that perhaps speaks to the lows we've reached in air travel. It’s called “rawdogging” and refers to the practice, in some measure, of adopting a monk-like asceticism whilst flying.", "People are ditching the usual flight rituals of reading a book, plugging in music, binge-watching shows, or picking up that in-flight magazine to do nothing and just be with their thoughts and musings. This trend, quite popular in the West and on TikTok, is called rawdogging a flight.What is rawdogging a flight?", "He went viral in May after posting about his choice to go without entertainment for a seven-hour trip, opting to watch the flight map instead. \"Anyone else bareback flights?\", he had asked in the caption. The publication reported that many responded to his TikTok post.", "Billed as a social satire, the movie takes place on a long-haul flight where the entertainment system is down, leaving passengers to deal with their boredom, the Triangle of Sadness director said in an early interview.", "Some individuals on social media have shared that they're simply sitting and staring silently at the flight map on the screen in front of them for the entire duration. As per GQ the 'raw-dogging' trend began with West - a 26-year-old Londoner who asked the publication to only use his first name.", "The viral trend of enduring long flights with no phones, screens or distractions recently captured the world's attention. But what if we remain unplugged once we step off a plane?\nIt's all about the power of the mind – or so they say. The viral trend of \"raw-dogging\" long flights, where passengers stare straight ahead without any in-flight entertainment, books, music or screens, and refrain from eating, drinking or sleeping for the entire journey, captured the world's attention this summer. Manchester City forward Erling Haaland posted a video of himself on a seven-hour flight, boasting \"no phone, no sleep, no water, no food\". He wasn't the only celebrity to get in on the act, with Australian music producer Torren Foot and actor and musician Jared Leto also sharing their respective 15- and 17- hour raw-dogging experiences.\nWhile it may be easy to dismiss raw-dogging (and its rather obscene name) as foolish or even nihilistic, it undoubtedly says something about our digital dependency: we're so reliant on external stimuli that going without distractions for several hours is now considered a \"challenge\". Yet, studies have shown that focusing on the present and being mindful can have a positive impact on health and wellbeing, including reducing anxiety, depression and blood pressure while improving sleep. Excessive smartphone use, meanwhile, can be detrimental to our physical and mental well-being, and it impacts everything from our sleep routines to our musculoskeletal health. That should be your cue to power off and sit up straighter.\nAs with every viral challenge, there's a darker side to raw-dogging. Medical professionals warn that in extreme cases, where participants avoid drinking water, moving or even using the bathroom on long flights, the viral trend is so dangerous it could even kill you.\nWhile avoiding external stimuli is counterintuitive to travel, I still wondered whether there was something deeper or even mindful about the digital detox part of the raw-dogging trend that I could apply to my trip once I stepped off a plane.\nIf one of the great purposes of travel is seeking out new experiences and escaping our regular routines, why are we so tethered to the same devices and screens we rely on back home? I thought it would feel refreshing to turn off my phone for the entirety of a trip. Perhaps this mental cleanse, free from apps and notifications, would allow me to connect more deeply with a new setting and rediscover the way people have travelled throughout history.\nI decided to apply this part of raw-dogging a flight to raw-dogging a destination: no phone, no social media, no distractions; just a traveller absorbing a new environment while trying to stay as present as possible in the moment.\nThe Spanish city of Palma, Mallorca, may not seem like an obvious place for a mindful retreat. Its reputation as a sun-soaked playground, where many tourists do little more than tan, party and sip cocktails is one of many reasons why residents have recently pushed back against overtourism. As the city has increasingly become flooded by partiers and selfie-takers, locals are now fighting to reclaim it. By keeping my phone off, my aim was to meet these people, listen to their recommendations and explore a more soulful side of the city.\nUpon arriving, I decided against jumping on a bus or hailing a taxi, embracing the city's surprisingly walkable nature by travelling from the airport to my lodging by foot. The directions were easy to remember: get to the beach, turn left and follow the coastline until I reached my street. Without music or a podcast, I listened to the sounds of distant waves hitting the beach and the way locals wove in and out of Spanish and Mallorca's other official language, Mallorquín, a variation of Catalan. This soundtrack accompanied my first glimpse of Palma: its distinctive honey-hued stone buildings, its dramatic Gothic and Baroque buildings and – yes – the many foreign visitors crowding the beaches.\nI'm so used to consulting that live dot on my phone's Google Maps app, that without it, I began to worry that I'd gone the wrong way. I asked a group of elderly women sitting outside a cafe if I was heading in the right direction, showing them the address scribbled on the inside of my notebook cover. They nodded, and with a few gestures and finger-pointing, they steered me towards my destination.\nAfter a brief swim in the sea, I took a bus to Palma's historic centre where I met a 23-year-old Turkish man named Erten, who had been studying in Mallorca. I asked him for his recommendations, and soon, Mallorcans sitting nearby chimed in with their own suggestions. One lady pointed out of the window at the pop-up markets lining the streets. Shaking her head dismissively, she remarked, \"These markets are for tourists. If you want a real market, go to Santa Catalina. It's much better.\"\nErten was a pastry aficionado, and he insisted no visit to Palma was complete without eating an ensaïmada (a traditional coil-shaped Mallorcan pastry traditionally stuffed with lard and enjoyed with coffee). As a vegan, I didn't hold out much hope, but as I'd soon learn, each bakery seems to offer its own take on the delicacy.\nAfter getting off the bus, I came across a family-run bakery called Fornet de la Soca that has been specialising in reviving once-forgotten Mallorcan pastries and breads for the past 14 years. The owners use rediscovered varieties of Mallorcan flour (such as vestit and xeixa) to make their canyalons (cream-filled pastries), robiols (lamb- or fruit-stuffed turnovers) and ensaïmadas.\nThe bakery's sweeter ensaïmadas were filled with fruits from Sóller, an idyllic nearby town that customers at the bakery insisted I should visit. An elderly lady (carrying a bag full of ensaïmadas for her grandchildren) told me Sóller is known for its agricultural heritage – especially its prized citrus fruits. As if noticing my interest had been piqued, an otherwise quiet woman chimed in excitedly, \"And you take a wooden train to get there!\"\nThat settled it, I decided. I'd board a vintage train the following afternoon.\nMore like this: • The town that banned influencers • Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers • How a viral ad campaign is teaching us to 'life-see', not sightsee\nSoundtracked by the gentle rattle of old wooden carriages, the train ride to Sóller took me back in time. As we began to leave Palma's cobbled streets behind, the bars packed with German and British tourists slowly disappeared, and were replaced by lush valleys and rugged peaks. On our slow ascent up the Unesco-inscribed Serra de Tramuntana mountain range, I marvelled at Mallorca's \"backbone\", and felt grateful to the locals who pushed me out of the city centre.\nHaving already spent more than an hour inside Palma's stunning La Seu Cathedral that morning, I was happy to admire Sóller's Gothic Sant Bartomeu Church from its nearby square. As I sat with a coffee, I started talking to an older Mallorcan man who had lived in Sóller for most of his life. He said you could smell the strong aroma of oranges on the outskirts of the town, inhaling deeply for full effect. When he found out I was Irish, he became more animated and started clicking his fingers until the words came to him. \"Star Trek!\" he finally exclaimed. It turned out that Irish actor Colm Meaney (or \"Miles O'Brien\" to Trekkies) had lived nearby.\nBack in Palma, I continued to wander and seek out local stories. Near the bay in the city's historic fishing neighbourhood of El Jonquet, windmills decorated the skyline. A woman organising boat tours at the marina told me they date back to the 14th Century, explaining that these landmarks offer glimpses into Mallorca's rural past, when they were used to grind grain and pump water. In total, there are around 3,000 preserved on the island. \"They are symbols of our history,\" she added, with more than a hint of pride.\nDuring my stay, I made a point to ask as many Mallorcans as I could how they wished tourists would behave when visiting their island. Aside from keeping their shirts on when stumbling through Palma's Old Town, one of the most common answers was for visitors to take more of an interest in local culture.\n\"Every place in the Old Town of Palma has its own history. I really like it when people ask us about ours and why we chose that area,\" said Andrea Santioana, who opened vegan restaurant Ca n’Ela with her mother four years ago. \"The Mallorcan stone has a stunning, authentic beauty, and the rich history of each street is enchanting.\"\nWhile having a phone meant that I didn't feel compelled to tick off a list of sights and could instead absorb Palma more on my own terms, it wasn't without its challenges. The idea of stumbling across a vegan spot is appealing until hunger kicks in, at which point you're ready to settle for a portion of generic Spanish patatas bravas (potatoes in tomato sauce). It's a good thing I didn't, though, as I savoured every bite of a seitan dish topped with lemon cream at Ca n’Ela.\nIn the end, my trip to Palma and Sóller reaffirmed the value of staying present in our increasingly distracted world. I often lean on online recommendations when I travel, but by casting my phone aside and relying only on local recommendations, I rediscovered the joy of spontaneity and connection at the core of travel. While our screens can make for convenient travel companions, they can also get in the way of simple joys like following your curiosity down a street, approaching a stranger and allowing yourself to get lost while wandering through a new neighbourhood.\nOn the plane ride home, I felt the urge to dig into my bag and power my phone on.

{"id": 382, "question": "Which Spanish city did the author choose for their tech-free travel experiment?", "answer": ["Palma, Mallorca"], "doc": ["Rather than formal classes held daily in the Austro-American Institute for Education (a haven for free internet, tap water, and travel information for students), we held informal, on-the-go classes in a variety of settings around the city. One of these classes was a guided, historical tour led by an old friend of our faculty leader, Dr. Demers.", "I decided to go during the spring semester because it meant doing two trimesters in Spain for the price of one– no brainer. At the end of my sophomore year I went to talk to one of my Spanish professors about the trip, and for the first time, I found out how selective it was. UCA generally only sent 2-4 students.", "Each city contained unique moments. A tour through the salt mine in Hallstatt was the coolest tour I’ve been on in my life, for reasons which I shan’t spoil in a blogpost. Riding a bike around Salzburg’s city and greenery refreshed my soul.", "A lady named Nina, who was homeless, directed us around the city and shared the hope of the eradication of homelessness in Austria. Touring Auschwitz and Birkenau extermination/concentration camps and taking day trips to nearby cities were also vastly educational.", "Each class involved projects and exams to test my abilities in expression and comprehension. In addition to classes, each week, the university had a set of excursions and activities in which the students could participate. Because of the excursions, I was able to travel all over the northwestern portion of France.", "The viral trend of enduring long flights with no phones, screens or distractions recently captured the world's attention. But what if we remain unplugged once we step off a plane?\nIt's all about the power of the mind – or so they say. The viral trend of \"raw-dogging\" long flights, where passengers stare straight ahead without any in-flight entertainment, books, music or screens, and refrain from eating, drinking or sleeping for the entire journey, captured the world's attention this summer. Manchester City forward Erling Haaland posted a video of himself on a seven-hour flight, boasting \"no phone, no sleep, no water, no food\". He wasn't the only celebrity to get in on the act, with Australian music producer Torren Foot and actor and musician Jared Leto also sharing their respective 15- and 17- hour raw-dogging experiences.\nWhile it may be easy to dismiss raw-dogging (and its rather obscene name) as foolish or even nihilistic, it undoubtedly says something about our digital dependency: we're so reliant on external stimuli that going without distractions for several hours is now considered a \"challenge\". Yet, studies have shown that focusing on the present and being mindful can have a positive impact on health and wellbeing, including reducing anxiety, depression and blood pressure while improving sleep. Excessive smartphone use, meanwhile, can be detrimental to our physical and mental well-being, and it impacts everything from our sleep routines to our musculoskeletal health. That should be your cue to power off and sit up straighter.\nAs with every viral challenge, there's a darker side to raw-dogging. Medical professionals warn that in extreme cases, where participants avoid drinking water, moving or even using the bathroom on long flights, the viral trend is so dangerous it could even kill you.\nWhile avoiding external stimuli is counterintuitive to travel, I still wondered whether there was something deeper or even mindful about the digital detox part of the raw-dogging trend that I could apply to my trip once I stepped off a plane.\nIf one of the great purposes of travel is seeking out new experiences and escaping our regular routines, why are we so tethered to the same devices and screens we rely on back home? I thought it would feel refreshing to turn off my phone for the entirety of a trip. Perhaps this mental cleanse, free from apps and notifications, would allow me to connect more deeply with a new setting and rediscover the way people have travelled throughout history.\nI decided to apply this part of raw-dogging a flight to raw-dogging a destination: no phone, no social media, no distractions; just a traveller absorbing a new environment while trying to stay as present as possible in the moment.\nThe Spanish city of Palma, Mallorca, may not seem like an obvious place for a mindful retreat. Its reputation as a sun-soaked playground, where many tourists do little more than tan, party and sip cocktails is one of many reasons why residents have recently pushed back against overtourism. As the city has increasingly become flooded by partiers and selfie-takers, locals are now fighting to reclaim it. By keeping my phone off, my aim was to meet these people, listen to their recommendations and explore a more soulful side of the city.\nUpon arriving, I decided against jumping on a bus or hailing a taxi, embracing the city's surprisingly walkable nature by travelling from the airport to my lodging by foot. The directions were easy to remember: get to the beach, turn left and follow the coastline until I reached my street. Without music or a podcast, I listened to the sounds of distant waves hitting the beach and the way locals wove in and out of Spanish and Mallorca's other official language, Mallorquín, a variation of Catalan. This soundtrack accompanied my first glimpse of Palma: its distinctive honey-hued stone buildings, its dramatic Gothic and Baroque buildings and – yes – the many foreign visitors crowding the beaches.\nI'm so used to consulting that live dot on my phone's Google Maps app, that without it, I began to worry that I'd gone the wrong way. I asked a group of elderly women sitting outside a cafe if I was heading in the right direction, showing them the address scribbled on the inside of my notebook cover. They nodded, and with a few gestures and finger-pointing, they steered me towards my destination.\nAfter a brief swim in the sea, I took a bus to Palma's historic centre where I met a 23-year-old Turkish man named Erten, who had been studying in Mallorca. I asked him for his recommendations, and soon, Mallorcans sitting nearby chimed in with their own suggestions. One lady pointed out of the window at the pop-up markets lining the streets. Shaking her head dismissively, she remarked, \"These markets are for tourists. If you want a real market, go to Santa Catalina.

{"id": 384, "question": "What was the life expectancy for a child born in Singapore in 1960?", "answer": ["65"], "doc": ["When it comes to longevity, few places in the world have seen such a drastic jump in life expectancy as the island city-state in Southeast Asia. A child born in the country in 1960 was only likely to live (at the time) to 65, but a child born in Singapore today can expect to live to more than 86 according to estimates.", "By attacking the causes of death that have kept population growth low for most of human existence, we have extended life expectancies and multiplied our numbers. Life expectancy has increased steadily through history. During the Roman Empire, average life expectancy at birth was a brief 22 years.", "Meanwhile, life expectancy in less developed countries has gradually climbed, rising to about 65 years today. Initial declines in mortality can be attributed to improvements in public health and living standards that accompanied the Industrial Revolution.", "When it comes to longevity, few places in the world have seen such a drastic jump in life expectancy as the island city-state in Southeast Asia.\nA child born in the country in 1960 was only likely to live (at the time) to 65, but a child born in Singapore today can expect to live to more than 86 according to estimates. In addition, the number of centenarians in Singapore doubled over the 10-year period from 2010-2020.\nThis huge leap in longevity has largely been driven by intentional government policy and investment. The distinction even was enough to have the country named the world's sixth \"Blue Zone\" in August 2023. Though recently questioned for their accuracy by demographers, the Blue Zones were discovered and coined by National Geographic journalist Dan Buettner, who claimed to identify regions where people lived longer, healthier lives, in large part due to a combination of culture, lifestyle, diet and community.\nSingapore was the first new region to be added to the Blue Zones in decades (dubbed a \"Blue Zone 2.0\" by Buettner) and stands apart from the other Blue Zones in part because the longevity of its people comes more from forward-thinking policies than long-established cultural traditions in other Blue Zone communities like Ikaria, Greece or Nicoya, Costa Rica. \nBut it's not just the quantity of life, but also the quality of life that residents here appreciate. We spoke to a few of them to understand which policies and practices make their lives healthier, and happier – and what they recommend to others seeking to live here in search of a longer life. \nResidents in Singapore have witnessed the government's gradual policy changes that affect their health and wellness.\n\"Having grown up here, I've seen firsthand the transformation in community health consciousness,\" said resident Firdaus Syazwani, who runs the financial advice blog Dollar Bureau. \"The heavy taxation on cigarettes and alcohol coupled with stringent public smoking bans not only improves individual health but also enhances public spaces, making them more welcoming and cleaner. No more second-hand smoke!\"\nHe was surprised to learn about the Blue Zone designation, if only because of the high amount of sugar, salt and coconut milk used in local dishes. But even that's changing (if slowly) because of policy. \"Given our local cuisine's penchant for richer ingredients, the Health Promotion Board has initiatives to encourage healthier dietary choices among residents,\" he explained. \"Measures like mandatory nutritional labelling and the reduction of sugar content in beverages have made a noticeable difference in public health awareness and choices. Although it's yet to be known exactly how effective this initiative is, I personally tend to steer away from sugary drinks when I see these labels.\"\nSingapore's healthcare system has also received global accolades for both its quality of care and its ability to keep costs contained. The 2023 Legatum Prosperity Index ranked the country the best in the world as it relates to citizens' health and their ability to access healthcare. The country offers universal healthcare coverage, but also has a mix of private services and savings funds to help cover out-of-pocket expenses.\nBut it's not just healthcare that plays a role in residents living longer lives. Other policies like robust public transportation encourage walking and daily exercise, while a prioritisation on keeping the country clean and beautiful also gives residents a sense of security and calm.\n\"Government initiatives that prioritise the seamless integration of parks, gardens and nature reserves into the cityscape have earned [Singapore] the reputation of being a 'garden city',\" said Charu Kokate, senior partner at Safdie Architects, who also was the project lead behind the firm's iconic buildings like Sky Habitat Residential Towers and Jewel Changi Airport. \"After living in Singapore for more than 15 years, I am constantly impressed by how the Urban Redevelopment Authority has meticulously planned the city. Their focus on sustainability, efficient land use and incorporating green spaces into urban life is remarkable. While Singapore's laws can be strict, they have resulted in a clean and well-maintained environment.\"\nMore like this:• What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024• The European region where young people are happiest• Why Switzerland is home to two of the world's most liveable cities\nOne of her favourite places to visit is the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Located in the city centre, it's the only tropical garden to be recognised as a Unesco World Heritage site. \"Its remarkable orchid collection and focus on plant research and conservation make it a haven for nature lovers, families and tourists seeking peace and beauty,\" she said.\nThe public parks also serve as a hub for community, a factor that all longevity researchers agree is essential to living a long, healthy life. \"From young adults to seniors, you'll find a wide demographic engaged in regular exercise, facilitated by extensive public parks, fitness corners and gym classes that are easily accessible throughout the city,\" said Syazwani.\nFor those considering a move here, embracing that community spirit and lifestyle is key.

The country is often ranked as one of the world's most expensive places to live, with Mercer ranking it second after Hong Kong.\nThough the population is diverse, with people emigrating here from across the world, the government prioritises a strong sense of social cohesion, enforced through laws and enforcement. The state has strict laws (and penalties) against littering, smoking in public, drugs and even jaywalking, but many residents find the regulations help keep the country a safer and more beautiful place to live. \n\"The government's policies are carefully aligned with the needs of the population, focusing on improving the overall quality of life, supporting economic stability and maintaining social harmony,\" said Kokate. \"Singapore's political stability plays a key role in fostering an environment that encourages business investment, economic growth and social cohesion.\"\nThat said, the country also celebrates its diversity, especially in the form of the country's world-renowned food scene and annual festivals, from Chinese New Year to Deepavali (Diwali) to the International Festival of the Arts. \n\"The city has something for everyone, regardless of age,\" said Kokate. \"The multicultural society embraces a wide range of traditions, creating a rich and vibrant cultural experience that enhances the stay for both visitors and expats.\" \nLiving In is a series from BBC Travel that discovers what it's like to reside in some of the world's top destinations. \n-- \nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Bengali Durga Puja is more than just a holiday; it encompasses all of the national sentiments. Celebrate Durga Puja 2023 without worrying about the funds!", "Durga Puja, one of the biggest annual Hindu festivals, starts on 9 October and idol-makers across Bangladesh are working round the clock. This year, amidst a backdrop of recent political upheaval and reported attacks on Hindu minorities, this celebration of good over evil feels particularly poignant.\nAs the festival of Durga Puja approaches, villages and towns across Bangladesh fill with anticipation. While the event is celebrated by millions across India and Nepal, in Bangladesh, where Hindus make up about 8% of the 170 million population, Durga Puja carries a special significance. It has become a cultural phenomenon, with people from various backgrounds, including the Muslim majority, enjoying the dazzling spectacles, colourful processions and festivities. Yet, for Bangladesh’s Hindu community, Durga Puja is much more than just a celebration – it’s a deeply spiritual occasion that brings them together; a chance to strengthen communal bonds.\nThis year, however, the festival unfolds against a more politically charged backdrop. The recent ousting of Sheikh Hasina’s government, fuelled by student-led protests and reported attacks on Hindu minorities, have heightened tensions. Yet, Durga Puja stands as a symbol of resilience and unity in an increasingly polarised society. Amid this political upheaval, the festival offers a moment of collective hope and reflection. For the last few weeks, idol-makers in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, have been working tirelessly to create the divine figures that will soon be the heart of this celebration and worshipped by millions, affirming their cultural and religious heritage in challenging times.\nTucked away in one of the countless narrow alleys of Old Dhaka's historic Shakhari Bazar is the workshop of Balai Pal, the city's most sought-after idol sculptor. The bazaar's labyrinthine paths and unmarked doors can bewilder even the most determined explorer; finding this place, surrounded by the honking of rickshaws and the tantalising scent of biryani, is nearly impossible without guidance. \nEmbedded in brick buildings – some dating back 400 years – are small temples adorned with intricate deity idols. These temples remind us that this is the heart of the city's 1.5 million Hindu population. Shakhari Bazaar is considered Dhaka's epicentre for vibrant Hindu festivals, with Durga Puja being the largest and most important religious event for Bangladesh’s Hindu minority.\nAfter passing through a narrow passage and a small metal gate into a courtyard, I arrive at the Sri Sri Pran Ballabh Jeu Mandir workshop, which has remained relatively unchanged for nearly 130 years. In these modest confines, beneath a makeshift tin roof, extraordinary artistry unfolds. A team of 16 men, led by Pal, tirelessly work around the clock in shifts to transform humble materials into divine figures. These idols will soon be worshipped by hundreds of thousands of the city’s Hindus during the five-day festival, which culminates on 13 October.\nStepping inside the workshop instantly transports you to another realm. The air pollution and honking horns vanish, replaced by cool shade, the rhythmic strokes of brushes and the earthy scent of hay and damp soil. Apart from the occasional quiet exchange between artisans, the atmosphere is so hushed you can almost hear their breathing. Each craftsman is deeply absorbed, meticulously shaping divine figures with unwavering focus, their dedication evident in every sculpted detail. The workshop operates year-round, crafting idols of several gods for various Hindu festivals, including Kali Puja, Maha Shivaratri and Diwali. However, Durga Puja is by far their busiest time of year, as the demand for idols of Goddess Durga and her children peaks during this celebration.\nI am captivated by the statues of Goddess Durga, lovingly called \"Durga Maa\". The Durga Puja honours her descent to Earth and victory over the demon Mahishasura, symbolising the triumph of good over evil. It tells the story of how the goddess leaves her spiritual realm for five days every autumn to visit her mortal devotees, allowing them to be seen by her. During this time, her spirit is believed to inhabit the idols made in her image, serving as a bridge between the divine and her earthly worshipers, who seek her blessings for strength and protection. These intricately designed idols, crafted over several months, depict Durga wielding weapons and riding a lion or tiger. Devotees worship these idols in colourful pandals, temples and homes, offering prayers and gifts to the goddess's spirit within them.\nFor these artisans, creating idols is a form of puja (worship), an act of devotion to the deities that they hope will win them favour. \"It's the power of Durga that enables me to work so many hours and so hard,\" says Neelandri, one of the longest-serving artisans here. \"Durga Maa guides us and moves our limbs to create her image from earthly materials.\" The artisans believe their work is sacred and refrain from eating meat or drinking alcohol while making the Durga idols.\nPal, one of the most esteemed idol artisans in the country, is the owner of this workshop. He proudly tells me it is the biggest of its kind in Dhaka – a claim confirmed by the locals I ask – and that his family have been making idols in this workshop for three generations. Now 55, Pal started making idols alongside his father when he was just 10. “It was the lord that chose me for this role,” Pal tells me, as he masterfully draws an eye. “It’s a blessing for us to have been chosen to serve our [gods].”\n \nArtisans typically work around eight to nine hours a day, taking Fridays off, to perfect their creations. However, during Durga Puja, the busiest time of the year, they often extend their hours to more than 12 or 13 hours every day. They even eat and sleep in the workshop during the weeks leading up to the festival. Despite the physical exhaustion, the artisans tell me that the spirit of Durga fuels their dedication, motivating them to continue. They understand that the timely completion of the idols brings joy and devotion to worshippers. As the deadline approaches, the air buzzes with a mix of excitement and pressure, encapsulating the emotional weight of their craft.\nArtisans employ centuries-old techniques to craft the idols, with the process beginning four to five weeks before Durga Puja. No moulds are used; instead, they construct frames from bamboo, wood, yarn and straw before applying thick layers of soil and clay by hand. After a white base is painted onto the idols, Pal meticulously paints intricate details, especially the eyes and face, while supervising other craftsmen. The entire process, taking hours of delicate brushwork. ensures each piece epitomises the beauty of Goddess Durga.\nPal says that long before his grandfather started working in this profession, the idols were a lot more minimalistic. However, over time, they have become increasingly complex and colourful. With the advent of social media, worshippers and idol-makers alike now take inspiration from contemporary styles and designs – particularly the latest trends sported by Bollywood actresses, which have made their way onto Durga’s outfits and jewellery. \nMore like this:• A tenacious nation built on shape-shifting land• Bangladesh's fiery, inventive spin on rice• An archipelago of killer cats\nFor example, the cotton-and-silk Bangladeshi saris that traditionally adorned the idols were earthy in tone with minimal embellishments. In recent years, however, these have been largely replaced by synthetic fabrics that are vibrant in colour, use modern draping techniques and are heavily embellished for glamour.\nPal's clients are mainly Puja committees – groups of about 50 community elders who manage temples and oversee religious events like Durga Puja and ensure that idol procurement reflects the community's artistic, religious and cultural values. Pal earns 800,000-900,000 Bangladeshi taka (£5,000-£5,800) during Durga Puja, making it his most profitable time of year. This is significantly higher than the average Bangladeshi salary of around £2,500 per year. Despite this, Pal insists that his motivation is devotion, not money.\n \nThe final day of Durga Puja, Bijoya Dashami, signifies Goddess Durga's return to her celestial abode. Devotees form lively processions around Shakhari Bazaar, chanting, singing and dancing as they carry the idols to Dhaka’s Buriganga River. There, they gently immerse the idols in the water, bidding farewell as the holy figures slowly dissolve – a symbol of the goddess's departure to her husband, Lord Shiva. The atmosphere is a poignant mix of joy and sorrow, celebrating the goddess's presence while feeling the emotional weight of her parting. With this ritual, the autumn Durga Puja concludes, and, as generations before them, Pal and his team can rest, knowing their devotion and craft have been enough for another year. \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

{"id": 390, "question": "What is the length of the National Famine Way?", "answer": ["165km"], "doc": ["National Famine Way The National Famine Way is a 165km way marked walking and cycling trail commemorating a heartbreaking walk of forced emigration which took place in 1847 at the height of the Irish famine.", "The National Famine Way is a 165km way marked walking and cycling trail commemorating a heartbreaking walk of forced emigration which took place in 1847 at the height of the Irish famine.", "The National Famine Way is a 165km trail that traces the footsteps of the Strokestown tenants, men, women and children who were marched from Roscommon to Dublin in 1847 after they failed to pay their rent. In Dublin, they boarded a ship to Liverpool before journeying to North America on board some of the worst coffin ships of the time.", "As a rule of thumb I would always advise people to follow the National Famine Way Signs along the route but below is a list of the 18 crossings and the distance between them from the Sea Lock at the Liffey to the 46th Lock near the Shannon to ensure you are on the correct side to avoid dead ends, backtracking and detours.", "On arrival at EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum, walkers discover the fate of their famine family and receive a certificate of completion and a comprehensive end of trail booklet. After the first 20km the National Famine Way is mainly off road, following the towpath along the Royal Canal.", "The 165km (103 miles) National Famine Way from Strokestown to Dublin is a harrowing but deeply impactful route that allows modern walkers to follow in the footsteps of the Strokestown tenants.\nStrokestown was a welcome reprieve after our three-hour coach ride from Dublin, predominantly bending through winding country lanes. The small town in Roscommon, Ireland's central bog county, has a \"one-horse\" feel; its popular pub, J Beirne, is accessed through a simply labelled, plain white door in the back of a grocery store. A 2022 census cited a total population of just 850. However, Strokestown is not just a small community in rural Ireland – it's the trailhead for a trek commemorating the most tragic walk in Irish history. \nMy father and I had come here to hike the National Famine Way, a 165km heritage trail that connects Strokestown with the shoreside capital of Dublin. The route, dotted with bronze shoe trail markers, was launched in 2020 to commemorate 1,490 Strokestown residents who made this same journey on foot in 1847 after being forced out by their Anglo-Irish landlord, Major Denis Mahon. Failing to pay rent while starving under a national famine, they struck a deal to walk to Dublin in exchange for free passage to Canada – an agreement to undergo \"assisted\" emigration. Many would perish and lose contact with their families for generations to come, gaining them the nickname \"the missing 1,490\".\nThe trail is walkable in a minimum of six days to keep daily mileage feasible and allow time for sightseeing along the way. It is positioned between two poignant attractions: the National Famine Museum and the EPIC Museum of Irish Emigration. While sombre, it's an immense trek of education, connection and heritage. Increasingly hailed as \"Ireland's Camino\", the National Famine Way addresses the role that starvation and forced emigration played in shaping the modern Irish diaspora. It also shows that the missing 1,490 who tackled the walk to Dublin are far more than just a statistic; the trail hopes to reiterate that their memory should not be forgotten.\nThe event occurred during the Irish Famine (An Gorta Mór) that followed a catastrophic potato blight. The impact stretched from 1845 until 1852, damaging 75% of crops andespecially endangering tenant farmers whose primary food source and income came from potatoes.\n\"There was a quarter of the population surviving on potatoes,\" said Caroilin Callery, a prominent figure behind the trail’s creation and the daughter of Jim Callery, who founded the National Famine Museum after finding more than 50,000 local famine documents, including an 1846 petition from starving tenants in Cloonahee begging for assistance. Now a director of the Irish Heritage Trust, she explained: \"An acre of land could give you enough potatoes to survive and have your family survive, and Irish people were known to be eating up to 16lb of potatoes a day.\"\nDuring this time, Ireland lost approximately one million civilians to mass emigration and a million to starvation. All of this occurred under British colonial rule. It's categorised, at the very least, as a colossal organisational failure; a deadly set of circumstances created by continued exportation of alternative food sources like grain to Britain while the Irish population starved.\n\"In or around £10m between 1845 and 1852 was spent by the British government in various kinds of schemes in Ireland and little more than 10 years later there was £64m spent on the Crimean War,\" said Callery, noting the deprioritisation of saving those lower Irish classes.\nOne such scheme was relocating civilians to the New World. This emigration strategy reduced the population in Ireland while reclaiming the indebted rental properties that were no longer profitable for the predominantly Anglo-Irish landlords.\nStrokestown experienced one of the largest assisted emigrations in Ireland. The small town was centred around the privately owned house and grounds of Strokestown Park Estate, where the adjoining National Famine Museum now resides. Mahon inherited the estate in 1845, with the property already saddled with £30,000 in debt and tenant farmers who'd missed payment after payment. By 1847, he'd secured court rights to evict these families, offering three options: homelessness; the workhouse; or assisted emigration to Canada.\nCanada came with a catch, however; the passage would be paid for by Mahon, but the tenants had to walk 165km through unwelcoming terrain, exposed to angered wanderers, thieves, mobs and all elements to reach the ships in Dublin. Already starving and often dragging small children in tow, this was an agonising feat to demand. \nThe National Famine Way not only follows their route, but has a poignant stance in partnering with scholars to trace the original individuals who made the journey. In 2013, Strokestown even welcomed the grandson of Daniel Tighe, a 12-year-old boy who survived the journey on foot and boat, carving out a new life in Canada. The entire town burst into celebration on his descendent's arrival, who'd been discovered by sheer luck through investigations in Canada.\nMy father and hiked the trail in August, and on day one of six, our feet were already starting to throb as we walked 15km from Strokestown to Cloondara, the starting point of the Royal Canal. Just like the original walkers, arriving in Cloondara marked the beginning of our real journey. The canal would have been the most direct route to Dublin in the 19th Century, a rammed chaos of muddled passengers and freight transportation.\nThe initial 32km stretch snaked alongside the waterway from Cloondara to Abbeyshrule. The scenery stayed much the same as we strolled past meadows and counted down the canal's black-and-white-painted locks. Opening the National Famine Way app, I browsed through audio files for each section of the walk, which contained stories on some of those who braved this journey and area-specific historical insights. \n \nI listened to the haunting audio rendition of Daniel Tighe's distress at leaving behind the homely sight of Sliabh Ban, Roscommon's tallest hill. Near Mosstown Harbour, the lilting youth's voice continued with a disturbing tale of crazed, starving dogs fighting over a human corpse they'd pulled from a field. By the time we were an hour outside of Abbeyshrule, the first few blisters were rearing their unwanted heads. I gingerly applied plasters, wondering how the 1847 walkers got by lining their shoes with moss, as I'd earlier learned on the app. \nThere were no hotel rooms available in Mullingar, pushing us out to the next village of Moyvalley and creating a 40km beast of around nine hours rather than the recommended 30.3km. The canal was serene, with wildflowers and bullrushes swaying at eye level, disrupted only by intermittent splatters of rain or a startled heron. The original walkers would have set up camp along these banks. But, following in their footsteps, the scarce hotels were a reminder of the isolation and true scale of the journey. \nThe road surface switched between asphalt and tarmac, with the Mullingar workhouse and famine graveyard providing respite from our trudge. The 1841-built institution, which gave housing and employment to the desperate, is still relatively intact, although its cemetery stands testament to its inefficiency as a safe refuge in its time; a lingering home for the people from the period who didn’t make it. The workhouse complex was ridden with disease due to overcrowding, and it's thought that the graves would have extended far beyond their modern boundaries. \nMore like this:• The Irish city you should visit in 2024• The incredible reinvention of Ireland's 'awful' tourist town• The Irish ingredient born from famine \nMaynooth was our final overnight stay, a bubbly university town with castle ruins and ornate architecture. The final stretch of the trail was the hardest; my feet were so blistered that even hobbling to the shower the night before had felt like a battle. At 05:00, unable to sleep with adrenaline pumping, we set out on an early start. I couldn't tell if it was the exhaustion of walking more than 130km or the sudden dawning of the gravity of the tragedy, but I spent much of it in tears. Rested and fed, it was unfathomable to even begin to process how starving civilians, including children and the elderly, had traversed an identical route, not knowing what their future held.\nFinally emerging at Dublin’s River Liffey, we were beaming. But I couldn't have finished the National Famine Way without my dad. It's the quiet ways that parents selflessly make your life easier. Silently sneaking the heavier bags, offering the last sips of water and getting your order in first when you finally reach somewhere serving food.\nIt was heartbreaking to think of the love that Mary Tighe, Daniel’s widowed mother, would have had for her children. Perhaps she, too, took the heavier bags as they walked and stood aside to prioritise food and water for them. Yet Dublin represented a different kind of finality to her journey, and her 12-year-old son would next touch land in Canada as an orphan, accompanied only by the responsibility of becoming a sole carer to his younger sister.\nThe survival of the transatlantic voyage was a whole new beast aboard the darkly nicknamed \"coffin ships\". These often unseaworthy vessels were used to transport thousands of Irish emigrants across the Atlantic in the famine years. A third of the 1,490 would not see the new life they'd been promised.\n\"We were aware that these people had been very much forgotten,\" Callery said of the 1,490.\" There was a veil of silence over the famine from 1845 right through to the mid-1990s.

The small town in Roscommon, Ireland's central bog county, has a \"one-horse\" feel; its popular pub, J Beirne, is accessed through a simply labelled, plain white door in the back of a grocery store. A 2022 census cited a total population of just 850. However, Strokestown is not just a small community in rural Ireland – it's the trailhead for a trek commemorating the most tragic walk in Irish history. \nMy father and I had come here to hike the National Famine Way, a 165km heritage trail that connects Strokestown with the shoreside capital of Dublin. The route, dotted with bronze shoe trail markers, was launched in 2020 to commemorate 1,490 Strokestown residents who made this same journey on foot in 1847 after being forced out by their Anglo-Irish landlord, Major Denis Mahon. Failing to pay rent while starving under a national famine, they struck a deal to walk to Dublin in exchange for free passage to Canada – an agreement to undergo \"assisted\" emigration. Many would perish and lose contact with their families for generations to come, gaining them the nickname \"the missing 1,490\".\nThe trail is walkable in a minimum of six days to keep daily mileage feasible and allow time for sightseeing along the way. It is positioned between two poignant attractions: the National Famine Museum and the EPIC Museum of Irish Emigration. While sombre, it's an immense trek of education, connection and heritage. Increasingly hailed as \"Ireland's Camino\", the National Famine Way addresses the role that starvation and forced emigration played in shaping the modern Irish diaspora. It also shows that the missing 1,490 who tackled the walk to Dublin are far more than just a statistic; the trail hopes to reiterate that their memory should not be forgotten.\nThe event occurred during the Irish Famine (An Gorta Mór) that followed a catastrophic potato blight. The impact stretched from 1845 until 1852, damaging 75% of crops andespecially endangering tenant farmers whose primary food source and income came from potatoes.\n\"There was a quarter of the population surviving on potatoes,\" said Caroilin Callery, a prominent figure behind the trail’s creation and the daughter of Jim Callery, who founded the National Famine Museum after finding more than 50,000 local famine documents, including an 1846 petition from starving tenants in Cloonahee begging for assistance. Now a director of the Irish Heritage Trust, she explained: \"An acre of land could give you enough potatoes to survive and have your family survive, and Irish people were known to be eating up to 16lb of potatoes a day.\"\nDuring this time, Ireland lost approximately one million civilians to mass emigration and a million to starvation. All of this occurred under British colonial rule. It's categorised, at the very least, as a colossal organisational failure; a deadly set of circumstances created by continued exportation of alternative food sources like grain to Britain while the Irish population starved.\n\"In or around £10m between 1845 and 1852 was spent by the British government in various kinds of schemes in Ireland and little more than 10 years later there was £64m spent on the Crimean War,\" said Callery, noting the deprioritisation of saving those lower Irish classes.\nOne such scheme was relocating civilians to the New World. This emigration strategy reduced the population in Ireland while reclaiming the indebted rental properties that were no longer profitable for the predominantly Anglo-Irish landlords.\nStrokestown experienced one of the largest assisted emigrations in Ireland. The small town was centred around the privately owned house and grounds of Strokestown Park Estate, where the adjoining National Famine Museum now resides. Mahon inherited the estate in 1845, with the property already saddled with £30,000 in debt and tenant farmers who'd missed payment after payment. By 1847, he'd secured court rights to evict these families, offering three options: homelessness; the workhouse; or assisted emigration to Canada.\nCanada came with a catch, however; the passage would be paid for by Mahon, but the tenants had to walk 165km through unwelcoming terrain, exposed to angered wanderers, thieves, mobs and all elements to reach the ships in Dublin. Already starving and often dragging small children in tow, this was an agonising feat to demand. \nThe National Famine Way not only follows their route, but has a poignant stance in partnering with scholars to trace the original individuals who made the journey. In 2013, Strokestown even welcomed the grandson of Daniel Tighe, a 12-year-old boy who survived the journey on foot and boat, carving out a new life in Canada. The entire town burst into celebration on his descendent's arrival, who'd been discovered by sheer luck through investigations in Canada.\nMy father and hiked the trail in August, and on day one of six, our feet were already starting to throb as we walked 15km from Strokestown to Cloondara, the starting point of the Royal Canal. Just like the original walkers, arriving in Cloondara marked the beginning of our real journey. The canal would have been the most direct route to Dublin in the 19th Century, a rammed chaos of muddled passengers and freight transportation.\nThe initial 32km stretch snaked alongside the waterway from Cloondara to Abbeyshrule. The scenery stayed much the same as we strolled past meadows and counted down the canal's black-and-white-painted locks. Opening the National Famine Way app, I browsed through audio files for each section of the walk, which contained stories on some of those who braved this journey and area-specific historical insights. \n \nI listened to the haunting audio rendition of Daniel Tighe's distress at leaving behind the homely sight of Sliabh Ban, Roscommon's tallest hill. Near Mosstown Harbour, the lilting youth's voice continued with a disturbing tale of crazed, starving dogs fighting over a human corpse they'd pulled from a field. By the time we were an hour outside of Abbeyshrule, the first few blisters were rearing their unwanted heads. I gingerly applied plasters, wondering how the 1847 walkers got by lining their shoes with moss, as I'd earlier learned on the app. \nThere were no hotel rooms available in Mullingar, pushing us out to the next village of Moyvalley and creating a 40km beast of around nine hours rather than the recommended 30.3km. The canal was serene, with wildflowers and bullrushes swaying at eye level, disrupted only by intermittent splatters of rain or a startled heron. The original walkers would have set up camp along these banks. But, following in their footsteps, the scarce hotels were a reminder of the isolation and true scale of the journey. \nThe road surface switched between asphalt and tarmac, with the Mullingar workhouse and famine graveyard providing respite from our trudge. The 1841-built institution, which gave housing and employment to the desperate, is still relatively intact, although its cemetery stands testament to its inefficiency as a safe refuge in its time; a lingering home for the people from the period who didn’t make it. The workhouse complex was ridden with disease due to overcrowding, and it's thought that the graves would have extended far beyond their modern boundaries. \nMore like this:• The Irish city you should visit in 2024• The incredible reinvention of Ireland's 'awful' tourist town• The Irish ingredient born from famine \nMaynooth was our final overnight stay, a bubbly university town with castle ruins and ornate architecture. The final stretch of the trail was the hardest; my feet were so blistered that even hobbling to the shower the night before had felt like a battle. At 05:00, unable to sleep with adrenaline pumping, we set out on an early start. I couldn't tell if it was the exhaustion of walking more than 130km or the sudden dawning of the gravity of the tragedy, but I spent much of it in tears. Rested and fed, it was unfathomable to even begin to process how starving civilians, including children and the elderly, had traversed an identical route, not knowing what their future held.\nFinally emerging at Dublin’s River Liffey, we were beaming. But I couldn't have finished the National Famine Way without my dad. It's the quiet ways that parents selflessly make your life easier. Silently sneaking the heavier bags, offering the last sips of water and getting your order in first when you finally reach somewhere serving food.\nIt was heartbreaking to think of the love that Mary Tighe, Daniel’s widowed mother, would have had for her children. Perhaps she, too, took the heavier bags as they walked and stood aside to prioritise food and water for them. Yet Dublin represented a different kind of finality to her journey, and her 12-year-old son would next touch land in Canada as an orphan, accompanied only by the responsibility of becoming a sole carer to his younger sister.\nThe survival of the transatlantic voyage was a whole new beast aboard the darkly nicknamed \"coffin ships\". These often unseaworthy vessels were used to transport thousands of Irish emigrants across the Atlantic in the famine years.

{"id": 393, "question": "Where were Earthships first invented?", "answer": ["Taos, New Mexico"], "doc": ["Its combination of Pueblo adobe plaster, artistic building techniques and overarching bohemian values all play a role in the world’s first completely sustainable Earthship community. Earthships were created in the 1970s by architect Michael Reynolds, who still works and resides in the Taos Earthship community.", "In 2004, the very first Earthship in the UK was opened at Kinghorn Loch in Fife, Scotland. It was built by volunteers of the SCI charity. In 2005, the first earthship in England was established in Stanmer Park, Brighton with the Low Carbon Trust.", "By the end of the decade, there were some 20 contractors in North America building Earthships, and independent home builders were able to erect Earthships for less than $100,000 by studying with Reynolds’s firm, Solar Survival Architecture (later Earthship Biotecture).", ", it has erected entirely sustainable structures in Canada, Cambodia, Malaysia, Philippines, Argentina, Uruguay, Haiti and even Easter Island. In a world where more energy- and cost-efficient housing is increasingly important, Michael Reynolds’ Earthship vision brought to Taos over 50 years ago remains relevant. The best part?", "Earthships are designed to withstand the extreme temperatures of a desert, such as that around Taos, where extreme weather runs from sub-zero in winter to sweltering in summer.\nVenture into New Mexico's beautifully stark high desert and you may well stumble across some fantastical and unconventional homes – some palatial and sculpturally rounded; others with an ancient temple-like form – that look like they're from a Star Wars movie.\nSet in and around the town of Taos where they were invented almost 40 years ago, these are Earthships: net-zero, sustainably designed homes built mostly from both natural and waste materials, such as old tyres, empty wine bottles and wood and mud.\nSince Earthship construction requires less in the way of toxic or carbon-emitting construction materials like concrete and plastics, and doesn't require precious woodland and other natural resources, these exquisite homes are increasingly sought after worldwide. Earthships sell for anything from around $500,000 to $900,000 (£376,000 to £677,000) and are also available for overnight stays in and near Taos for around $240 (£180) per night.\nThe Earthship movement began in Taos in the 1970s after Kentucky native Michael Reynolds, founder of eco-construction company Earthship Biotecture, moved here in 1969 with an architecture degree. His goal: to \"ride dirt bikes, for fun,\" he says. \nThe now-71-year-old soon had an a-ha moment.\n\"I saw [CBS News anchor] Walter Cronkite on the news talking about clear-cutting forests for timber and creating not only erosion, but an oxygen problem because the trees put out oxygen,\" Reynolds tells the BBC. \"He was talking about what we call climate change and global warming now. I was seeing all these beer cans tossed away and I'm saying, 'why don't we build out of beer cans and not trees?'\"\nReynolds built his beer-can house in 1971, gaining small notice in the news for its quirkiness. Yet, it went on to be exhibited in various parts of the world, including the Louvre Museum in Paris, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Reynolds notes, with some incredulity, \"MoMA just bought a beer can brick for $4,500 (£3,386).\" Indeed, after using one of the building blocks made of beer cans in an exhibit, the museum decided to add one to its permanent collection.\nStill, for years he was largely looked at as a kook at best, and not a serious architect. \n\"It was a kind of a pie-in-the-sky ridiculous idea, but I went ahead and started going in that direction,\" Reynolds says. \"I started using bottles and I started using tyres, and I kept going. I've been in this direction for easily 55 years, and then around 36 years ago I first labelled a home as an Earthship.\"\nBut it's taken a long time to get to the point of wider acceptance. \"You know, they looked too weird and they still look strange, but now people are getting it, and they're also open to it because [many people] are two paycheques away from being homeless and getting crippled by electric and utility bills,\" Reynolds says of the financially empowering aspect of living off-grid. \"And now people want to reverse climate change.\"\nTaos is a place that has long attracted artists and individualists. Its ancient pueblo (village) and newer town have striking architecture, mostly traditional viga-beamed adobe homes, whose roofs are made of wood and beaten earth. Taos was the perfect incubator for Earthships, which have a thick wall of tyres, each packed with earth.\nAn earth berm (a purposefully built bank of soil) surrounds the Earthship on three sides, providing insulating mass that controls temperature. Cooling is via traditional transom windows set up high on supporting beams to cross ventilate, and the building's pipe vents. Each has a greenhouse (as Reynolds believes people should have to ability to grow their own food), either on the north or south side depending on location. Most Earthships are purely solar powered; some also have wind turbines to supplement or a wood-burning stove as back up.\nTaos has cold snowy winters and often dry, hot summers, but in an Earthship, the internal temperature remains close to 72F (21C) year-round, regardless of outside weather conditions.\nReynolds moved into his first Earthship 35 years ago, he says, and raised his family there – he still lives there: \"It's so comfy we don't want to leave it,\" he shrugs.\nWhat does it feel like to stay inside an Earthship? \"It feels like you're inside the womb,\" says Earthship construction manager Deborah Binder. \"You feel constantly hugged and snuggled. The temperature is always comfortable. Sometimes, when it's really cold outside I'll walk out without a coat not realising, because it's so warm inside.\"\nMore like this:• India's 10,000 forgotten mansions• Ghadames: Is this the perfect desert town?• Turkey's 300-year-old 'eco-mansions' \nBinder came on board 11 years ago to manage a non-profit project in Malawi, Africa, without any background in construction, she says. Not only did she stay with the company, she moved to Taos and currently rents an Earthship while she builds her own. Binder also teaches at the Earthship Academy, which attracts attendees of all types to learn Earthship design principles, construction methods and philosophy.\n\"Most people want to learn for themselves,\" Binder says. \"Some learn to build for community projects.\"\nDespite their environmental appeal, Earthships are still not accepted as an option to ease the housing and climate change crisis. \"They're still on the fringe in a way,\" says Binder. \"It's really important for people to stay in one. The feeling you have living in them is unique, but on a practical level you don't pay any utility bills. That's quite amazing.\"\n\"Once people experience them, they usually want one,\" Reynolds adds, something that is borne out by the many glowing testimonials in the guestbooks placed in each Earthship rental.\nReynolds believes it could not be more timely – urgent even – to make Earthships the norm. His goal is to build rentable community housing as an answer to homelessness and planet-devastating energy consumption. \"I'm not that interested in commissions; having a client just slows me down,\" he says. \"I need to turn them out fast and lease them to people for a fair rent.\"\nReynolds is full steam ahead with his latest streamlined Refuge Earthship model, which he thinks could help with homelessness and poverty due to the simple economics of not paying huge utility bills each month. \"Refuge is the most economical model to build; the one we are going to replicate all over the globe,\" he says passionately.\nThen there is the whimsical Atlantis, a striking curvy turquoise Earthship, created as an example of the buildings' sculptural, artful side.\n\"There is an art side to them — I've played with the bottles as stained glass, and there's the sculptural aspect. They are beautiful,\" says Reynolds, who put himself through college by working as an artist. \"What's really beautiful is they take care of people while taking care of the planet. There is not as much meaning in art as there is in a home.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Michael Reynolds, founder and creator of the concept, came to Taos, after graduating from Architecture School in 1969.", "Earthships are designed to withstand the extreme temperatures of a desert, such as that around Taos, where extreme weather runs from sub-zero in winter to sweltering in summer.\nVenture into New Mexico's beautifully stark high desert and you may well stumble across some fantastical and unconventional homes – some palatial and sculpturally rounded; others with an ancient temple-like form – that look like they're from a Star Wars movie.\nSet in and around the town of Taos where they were invented almost 40 years ago, these are Earthships: net-zero, sustainably designed homes built mostly from both natural and waste materials, such as old tyres, empty wine bottles and wood and mud.\nSince Earthship construction requires less in the way of toxic or carbon-emitting construction materials like concrete and plastics, and doesn't require precious woodland and other natural resources, these exquisite homes are increasingly sought after worldwide. Earthships sell for anything from around $500,000 to $900,000 (£376,000 to £677,000) and are also available for overnight stays in and near Taos for around $240 (£180) per night.\nThe Earthship movement began in Taos in the 1970s after Kentucky native Michael Reynolds, founder of eco-construction company Earthship Biotecture, moved here in 1969 with an architecture degree. His goal: to \"ride dirt bikes, for fun,\" he says. \nThe now-71-year-old soon had an a-ha moment.\n\"I saw [CBS News anchor] Walter Cronkite on the news talking about clear-cutting forests for timber and creating not only erosion, but an oxygen problem because the trees put out oxygen,\" Reynolds tells the BBC. \"He was talking about what we call climate change and global warming now. I was seeing all these beer cans tossed away and I'm saying, 'why don't we build out of beer cans and not trees?'\"\nReynolds built his beer-can house in 1971, gaining small notice in the news for its quirkiness. Yet, it went on to be exhibited in various parts of the world, including the Louvre Museum in Paris, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Reynolds notes, with some incredulity, \"MoMA just bought a beer can brick for $4,500 (£3,386).\" Indeed, after using one of the building blocks made of beer cans in an exhibit, the museum decided to add one to its permanent collection.\nStill, for years he was largely looked at as a kook at best, and not a serious architect. \n\"It was a kind of a pie-in-the-sky ridiculous idea, but I went ahead and started going in that direction,\" Reynolds says. \"I started using bottles and I started using tyres, and I kept going. I've been in this direction for easily 55 years, and then around 36 years ago I first labelled a home as an Earthship.\"\nBut it's taken a long time to get to the point of wider acceptance. \"You know, they looked too weird and they still look strange, but now people are getting it, and they're also open to it because [many people] are two paycheques away from being homeless and getting crippled by electric and utility bills,\" Reynolds says of the financially empowering aspect of living off-grid. \"And now people want to reverse climate change.\"\nTaos is a place that has long attracted artists and individualists. Its ancient pueblo (village) and newer town have striking architecture, mostly traditional viga-beamed adobe homes, whose roofs are made of wood and beaten earth. Taos was the perfect incubator for Earthships, which have a thick wall of tyres, each packed with earth.\nAn earth berm (a purposefully built bank of soil) surrounds the Earthship on three sides, providing insulating mass that controls temperature. Cooling is via traditional transom windows set up high on supporting beams to cross ventilate, and the building's pipe vents. Each has a greenhouse (as Reynolds believes people should have to ability to grow their own food), either on the north or south side depending on location. Most Earthships are purely solar powered; some also have wind turbines to supplement or a wood-burning stove as back up.\nTaos has cold snowy winters and often dry, hot summers, but in an Earthship, the internal temperature remains close to 72F (21C) year-round, regardless of outside weather conditions.\nReynolds moved into his first Earthship 35 years ago, he says, and raised his family there – he still lives there: \"It's so comfy we don't want to leave it,\" he shrugs.\nWhat does it feel like to stay inside an Earthship? \"It feels like you're inside the womb,\" says Earthship construction manager Deborah Binder. \"You feel constantly hugged and snuggled. The temperature is always comfortable. Sometimes, when it's really cold outside I'll walk out without a coat not realising, because it's so warm inside.\"\nMore like this:• India's 10,000 forgotten mansions• Ghadames: Is this the perfect desert town?• Turkey's 300-year-old 'eco-mansions' \nBinder came on board 11 years ago to manage a non-profit project in Malawi, Africa, without any background in construction, she says. Not only did she stay with the company, she moved to Taos and currently rents an Earthship while she builds her own. Binder also teaches at the Earthship Academy, which attracts attendees of all types to learn Earthship design principles, construction methods and philosophy.\n\"Most people want to learn for themselves,\" Binder says. \"Some learn to build for community projects.\"\nDespite their environmental appeal, Earthships are still not accepted as an option to ease the housing and climate change crisis. \"They're still on the fringe in a way,\" says Binder. \"It's really important for people to stay in one. The feeling you have living in them is unique, but on a practical level you don't pay any utility bills. That's quite amazing.\"\n\"Once people experience them, they usually want one,\" Reynolds adds, something that is borne out by the many glowing testimonials in the guestbooks placed in each Earthship rental.\nReynolds believes it could not be more timely – urgent even – to make Earthships the norm. His goal is to build rentable community housing as an answer to homelessness and planet-devastating energy consumption. \"I'm not that interested in commissions; having a client just slows me down,\" he says. \"I need to turn them out fast and lease them to people for a fair rent.\"\nReynolds is full steam ahead with his latest streamlined Refuge Earthship model, which he thinks could help with homelessness and poverty due to the simple economics of not paying huge utility bills each month. \"Refuge is the most economical model to build; the one we are going to replicate all over the globe,\" he says passionately.\nThen there is the whimsical Atlantis, a striking curvy turquoise Earthship, created as an example of the buildings' sculptural, artful side.\n\"There is an art side to them — I've played with the bottles as stained glass, and there's the sculptural aspect. They are beautiful,\" says Reynolds, who put himself through college by working as an artist. \"What's really beautiful is they take care of people while taking care of the planet. There is not as much meaning in art as there is in a home.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Historically a commuter train from Ankara to Kars, the train has gone viral among Turkish influencers in recent years for its stunning scenery through the east, full of off-the-beaten-path treasures.", "When I decided to travel to Turkey (now recognized as Türkiye) for the winter, my initial plan was to get on the sleeper train in Turkey with the famous Dogu Express that takes passengers from Ankara to Kars on a 24-hour journey during the winter wonderland.", "If you're planning to travel from Istanbul to Ankara by train, you need to know that there are two types of trains on the Istanbul-Ankara route (and vice versa): the high-speed train that typically only takes around 4 to 5 hours for one trip and the overnight train that comes with a sleeper cabin that takes about 9 hours for the train journey.", "But when I checked the same route today, the average price for a sleeper train ticket from Istanbul to Ankara is now around 710 TL (around $38.45) due to the high inflation that hit Turkey earlier this year.

The legacies of Romans, Byzantines, Armenians, Seljuk Turks, Ottomans and Czarist Russia all merge under mist-shrouded mountains. But here, the remnants of past empires have not only survived in the architecture but curiously, in the local cheese.\nHome to cheesemaking traditions inherited from Russian exiles, distant Kars is Turkey’s cheese capital. Now, a new museum celebrates this cheesy heritage as local cheesemakers strive to introduce eastern Turkey's culinary gifts to the wider world.\n\"Kars cheese is famous in Turkey,\" said Şeyma Çay, who creates itineraries for eastern Turkey travel specialists Silk Road Moments. \"Kars' Kashar is one of the most delicious cheeses in the country. The local cheeses are so famous because of the hundreds of different plant varieties in the region that are eaten by animals. The especially fatty milk they produce makes for extra flavourful cheeses.\"\nIndeed, Kars' main street was lined with mandira (cheese shops) where tour groups (almost exclusively Turkish) were busy tasting and buying the local specialties, which include the Kars Kashar – an aged cheese made with cow and sheep's milk – and my personal favourite, Kars Gravyer, a local hard cheese named after Swiss Gruyere that's actually more akin in flavour to Emmental.\nI lost count of the number of cheese mongers I passed on the way to Kars Peyniri Muzesi (Kars Cheese Museum), where replica wheels of Kars Gravyer framed an entranceway leading into a cold concrete fortress built in 1734 to defend Ottoman Kars against the expanding Russian Empire. \"When the Russians annexed Kars in 1878, they used this stronghold to store cheese,\" said museum \"storyteller\" and guide, Birol Aydin.\n\"Eight thousand years ago, people were making cheese on the Euphrates,\" he added, noting that Turkey's cheesemaking traditions date back to antiquity. \"When the Turkish people were nomads in Central Asia, they were making cheese, and we have written references to Anatolian cheese as far back as the 12th Century CE.\"\nWhen the Russians, who occupied much of what's now Eastern Turkey from 1878 until 1918, exiled a religious spiritualist group named the Molokans to the region, they inadvertently gifted Kars with the modern cheesemaking traditions found here today. Molokan means \"milk drinkers\" and adherents to the sect were reviled in Russia for consuming dairy products during fasts like Lent when Orthodox Christians abstained.\nKars sits at an altitude of 1,756m (5,761ft), and Molokan dairy farms thrived in a cold, unforgiving climate where animal husbandry was the only way to survive the long winters. Aydin explained how the Molokans brought new types of cheese to eastern Turkey, and in the late 19th Century, Russians built the first modern cheese factory in Kars.\nIn 1878, a visiting Swiss cheesemaker named David Moser found ripe conditions for Swiss cheese production, and he introduced the techniques and recipes still used to produce Kars Gravyer, now one of the most famous cheeses in Turkey. Professor Fügen Durlu-Özkaya, from the faculty of tourism, gastronomy and culinary arts at Ankara Hacı Bayram Veli University, later explained how Kars Gravyer's appeal stems largely from its unique, local production methods that have remained faithful to their mixed 19th-Century Molokan-Swiss roots.\n\"Local cheesemakers use original production methods. Staying true to its essence affects its taste, which helps with its popularity,\" she said. \"The use of copper cauldrons in production, the use of original wooden shovels and the meticulous use of traditional methods in the ageing and ripening stages of the cheese are the elements that make it so special and delicious.\"\nThe next day I had the chance to see these authentic production methods in action when I visited the cheesemaking village of Boğatepe, a half-hour drive through snow-draped landscapes from the city. Boğatepe is one of the original Molokan villages founded in the 19th Century, and while most Molokans returned to Russia after World War One or integrated into modern Turkey (I'm told there's only one old man left in the village who calls himself a Molokan), their recipes have been preserved by successive generations of Turkish cheesemakers.\nBoğatepe has a reputation for making some of the best cheese in Turkey, and almost all the cheese sold in the mandira down in Kars is produced in small, family-run factories here. The Koçulus are one of Boğatepe's cheesemaking families, and I joined Çağdaş Koçulu – who styles himself as \"The Master of Cheese\" and has studied cheese production in Kars, Switzerland and Germany – for a grand tour of their factory. Milk was being boiled in Molokan copper pots that Koçuluclaimed are 150 years old, while wheels of Kars Gravyer ripened in cold cellars below the factory floor.\nKars Gravyer requires a particular quality of cow's milk that's determined by what grasses and plants the cows have eaten, and as such, Kars Gravyer is only produced in spring and summer.  I was visiting in January when less milk is available, so production was focused on a type of cheese they described as \"fresh yellow cheese\", which is an un-aged version of Kars Kashar.\n\"The difference in the seasons affects the texture and taste of the cheese,\" Koçulu explained, as he whipped out a penknife and sliced me off a few tasters of fresh, unripened Kashar they'd started preparing earlier that day. \"Fresh yellow cheese is sweeter, more sugary than Kars Gravyer, which is saltier and sourer.\"\nRipening time is just as important as the quality of milk, and Kars Gravyer is aged for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of four years. Fresh yellow cheese has a much shorter maturation time and can be ready in a few weeks or months, but when it's ripened in hessian sacks, it can then be sold as \"Aged Kars Kashar\" (or \"Old Yellow Cheese\", as Koçulu described it).\nMore like this:• The Turkish city that lives for breakfast• Italy’s practically perfect food• The Spanish cheese nearing extinction\nBoğatepe cheesemakers produce as many as 32 distinct cheese types, and they're constantly developing or \"discovering\" new ones. \"You cannot find this one in the supermarkets in Istanbul,\" Koçulu said, showing me what he called \"Caucasian Shepherd's Cheese\". \"This was a lost, forgotten cheese, but we rediscovered the recipe and started producing it again. No one else is making this type of cheese.\"\nHe took me around Boğatepe's small cheese museum, which tells the same story but is more rustic than the modern one in Kars, before we sat down in the dining room above his family's cheese shop for the \"Cheesemaker's Breakfast\" that they offer to visitors.\nAs she laid out five or six cheeses on the wooden table, Koçulu's mother, Nigar, explained how tourists make the short journey from Kars just for breakfast. They typically stop by on their way to other popular nearby sights in the region, like Lake Cildir, a vast freshwater lake that's frozen in winter, and Ani, where you can visit the 11th-Century ruins of an Armenian kingdom's former capital. As she poured endless cups of hot tea, Nigar also explained how cheesemaking saved Boğatepe.\n\"In 2000, there was a very sad traffic accident. Seventeen people from the village were killed,\" she said, stopping me in my tracks, mid-bite. \"Many of the villagers intended to migrate to the cities, to escape the memories.\"\nAt the time of the disaster, Boğatepe's cheese industry was stagnating, providing further reason to leave. Nigar's brother, Ilhan Koçulu, rose to the challenge and convinced many would-be emigrants to stay as he secured funding from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). He launched a marketing campaign that reintroduced local cheeses like Kars Gravyer to cheese lovers across Turkey, which encouraged a surge in culinary tourists to Kars. \nAssisted by UNDP funding, Ilhan, Nigar and another Boğatepe local, Zümran Ömür, also founded a women's co-operative, which provides a point of contact for visitors, trains local women in the nuances of the tourism industry and allows them to distribute bookings across homestays in the village. This means the cheesemakers can focus on their craft, keeping the mandira in Kars stocked with Kashar and Gravyer, as the cooperative deals with the tourism business in Boğatepe.\n\"The cooperative is for our kids,\" Nigar said, outlining her hope that Boğatepe's cheese-making traditions will survive well into the future. \"It can help us to stay here and prevent the next generation from leaving for the bigger cities. Just look at my son. He stayed here and studied cheesemaking and now he's become a successful businessman in the village.\"\nGiven the increasing popularity of the Eastern Express – which terminates in Kars and can sell out in seconds in the winter season – the city's profile is certain to grow further in the future, opening new markets and inspiring more tourists to visit cheesemaking families like the Koçulus.\nBy the time I head back to Kars later that day I feel as if I've eaten a kilo of cheese, but that same evening, I'm consuming yet more of it as I watch Caucasus-style dancing in a restaurant named Pushkin. I willingly order yet another platter of local delicacies, including more Kars Gravyer, Tulum (a soft goat’s cheese, ripened in goatskin) and fresh, mellow Kashar.

The especially fatty milk they produce makes for extra flavourful cheeses.\"\nIndeed, Kars' main street was lined with mandira (cheese shops) where tour groups (almost exclusively Turkish) were busy tasting and buying the local specialties, which include the Kars Kashar – an aged cheese made with cow and sheep's milk – and my personal favourite, Kars Gravyer, a local hard cheese named after Swiss Gruyere that's actually more akin in flavour to Emmental.\nI lost count of the number of cheese mongers I passed on the way to Kars Peyniri Muzesi (Kars Cheese Museum), where replica wheels of Kars Gravyer framed an entranceway leading into a cold concrete fortress built in 1734 to defend Ottoman Kars against the expanding Russian Empire. \"When the Russians annexed Kars in 1878, they used this stronghold to store cheese,\" said museum \"storyteller\" and guide, Birol Aydin.\n\"Eight thousand years ago, people were making cheese on the Euphrates,\" he added, noting that Turkey's cheesemaking traditions date back to antiquity. \"When the Turkish people were nomads in Central Asia, they were making cheese, and we have written references to Anatolian cheese as far back as the 12th Century CE.\"\nWhen the Russians, who occupied much of what's now Eastern Turkey from 1878 until 1918, exiled a religious spiritualist group named the Molokans to the region, they inadvertently gifted Kars with the modern cheesemaking traditions found here today. Molokan means \"milk drinkers\" and adherents to the sect were reviled in Russia for consuming dairy products during fasts like Lent when Orthodox Christians abstained.\nKars sits at an altitude of 1,756m (5,761ft), and Molokan dairy farms thrived in a cold, unforgiving climate where animal husbandry was the only way to survive the long winters. Aydin explained how the Molokans brought new types of cheese to eastern Turkey, and in the late 19th Century, Russians built the first modern cheese factory in Kars.\nIn 1878, a visiting Swiss cheesemaker named David Moser found ripe conditions for Swiss cheese production, and he introduced the techniques and recipes still used to produce Kars Gravyer, now one of the most famous cheeses in Turkey. Professor Fügen Durlu-Özkaya, from the faculty of tourism, gastronomy and culinary arts at Ankara Hacı Bayram Veli University, later explained how Kars Gravyer's appeal stems largely from its unique, local production methods that have remained faithful to their mixed 19th-Century Molokan-Swiss roots.\n\"Local cheesemakers use original production methods. Staying true to its essence affects its taste, which helps with its popularity,\" she said. \"The use of copper cauldrons in production, the use of original wooden shovels and the meticulous use of traditional methods in the ageing and ripening stages of the cheese are the elements that make it so special and delicious.\"\nThe next day I had the chance to see these authentic production methods in action when I visited the cheesemaking village of Boğatepe, a half-hour drive through snow-draped landscapes from the city. Boğatepe is one of the original Molokan villages founded in the 19th Century, and while most Molokans returned to Russia after World War One or integrated into modern Turkey (I'm told there's only one old man left in the village who calls himself a Molokan), their recipes have been preserved by successive generations of Turkish cheesemakers.\nBoğatepe has a reputation for making some of the best cheese in Turkey, and almost all the cheese sold in the mandira down in Kars is produced in small, family-run factories here. The Koçulus are one of Boğatepe's cheesemaking families, and I joined Çağdaş Koçulu – who styles himself as \"The Master of Cheese\" and has studied cheese production in Kars, Switzerland and Germany – for a grand tour of their factory. Milk was being boiled in Molokan copper pots that Koçuluclaimed are 150 years old, while wheels of Kars Gravyer ripened in cold cellars below the factory floor.\nKars Gravyer requires a particular quality of cow's milk that's determined by what grasses and plants the cows have eaten, and as such, Kars Gravyer is only produced in spring and summer.  I was visiting in January when less milk is available, so production was focused on a type of cheese they described as \"fresh yellow cheese\", which is an un-aged version of Kars Kashar.\n\"The difference in the seasons affects the texture and taste of the cheese,\" Koçulu explained, as he whipped out a penknife and sliced me off a few tasters of fresh, unripened Kashar they'd started preparing earlier that day. \"Fresh yellow cheese is sweeter, more sugary than Kars Gravyer, which is saltier and sourer.\"\nRipening time is just as important as the quality of milk, and Kars Gravyer is aged for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of four years. Fresh yellow cheese has a much shorter maturation time and can be ready in a few weeks or months, but when it's ripened in hessian sacks, it can then be sold as \"Aged Kars Kashar\" (or \"Old Yellow Cheese\", as Koçulu described it).\nMore like this:• The Turkish city that lives for breakfast• Italy’s practically perfect food• The Spanish cheese nearing extinction\nBoğatepe cheesemakers produce as many as 32 distinct cheese types, and they're constantly developing or \"discovering\" new ones. \"You cannot find this one in the supermarkets in Istanbul,\" Koçulu said, showing me what he called \"Caucasian Shepherd's Cheese\". \"This was a lost, forgotten cheese, but we rediscovered the recipe and started producing it again. No one else is making this type of cheese.\"\nHe took me around Boğatepe's small cheese museum, which tells the same story but is more rustic than the modern one in Kars, before we sat down in the dining room above his family's cheese shop for the \"Cheesemaker's Breakfast\" that they offer to visitors.\nAs she laid out five or six cheeses on the wooden table, Koçulu's mother, Nigar, explained how tourists make the short journey from Kars just for breakfast. They typically stop by on their way to other popular nearby sights in the region, like Lake Cildir, a vast freshwater lake that's frozen in winter, and Ani, where you can visit the 11th-Century ruins of an Armenian kingdom's former capital. As she poured endless cups of hot tea, Nigar also explained how cheesemaking saved Boğatepe.\n\"In 2000, there was a very sad traffic accident. Seventeen people from the village were killed,\" she said, stopping me in my tracks, mid-bite. \"Many of the villagers intended to migrate to the cities, to escape the memories.\"\nAt the time of the disaster, Boğatepe's cheese industry was stagnating, providing further reason to leave. Nigar's brother, Ilhan Koçulu, rose to the challenge and convinced many would-be emigrants to stay as he secured funding from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). He launched a marketing campaign that reintroduced local cheeses like Kars Gravyer to cheese lovers across Turkey, which encouraged a surge in culinary tourists to Kars. \nAssisted by UNDP funding, Ilhan, Nigar and another Boğatepe local, Zümran Ömür, also founded a women's co-operative, which provides a point of contact for visitors, trains local women in the nuances of the tourism industry and allows them to distribute bookings across homestays in the village. This means the cheesemakers can focus on their craft, keeping the mandira in Kars stocked with Kashar and Gravyer, as the cooperative deals with the tourism business in Boğatepe.\n\"The cooperative is for our kids,\" Nigar said, outlining her hope that Boğatepe's cheese-making traditions will survive well into the future. \"It can help us to stay here and prevent the next generation from leaving for the bigger cities. Just look at my son. He stayed here and studied cheesemaking and now he's become a successful businessman in the village.\"\nGiven the increasing popularity of the Eastern Express – which terminates in Kars and can sell out in seconds in the winter season – the city's profile is certain to grow further in the future, opening new markets and inspiring more tourists to visit cheesemaking families like the Koçulus.\nBy the time I head back to Kars later that day I feel as if I've eaten a kilo of cheese, but that same evening, I'm consuming yet more of it as I watch Caucasus-style dancing in a restaurant named Pushkin. I willingly order yet another platter of local delicacies, including more Kars Gravyer, Tulum (a soft goat’s cheese, ripened in goatskin) and fresh, mellow Kashar. As Turkey’s east opens up to tourism, now’s the time for cheese lovers to make the pilgrimage to Kars, the country’s cheesy capital.\n --\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

As an international event, World Animal Day is celebrated in different ways around the world.", "From a horseback safari in Brazil to one of the marine world's most flamboyant sex shows, these wildlife encounters allow travellers to come face to face with animals – without getting too close.\nFor nearly a century, people around the globe have celebrated World Animal Day. Launched in 1925, the annual event on 4 October is designed to raise awareness of animal rights issues and help improve the treatment and wellbeing of wildlife. Today, the international effort includes more than 90 ambassadors in 70 countries, and in recent decades, travel has increasingly played a pivotal role in wildlife conservation.\nFrom the grassy plains of the African savanna to the depths of South Australia's oceans, people have long sought to come face to face with some of the planet's most remarkable creatures. But in many places, unregulated development and climate change are a growing risk to these animals' continued existence. In fact, according to a UN Report, more than one million plant and animal species are now threatened with extinction.\nAnother issue that seems to be on the rise is careless encounters with humans. The last few years have been filled with tales of tourists interacting with wildlife in ways that are both dangerous for them and for the animals in question. But for every reckless animal interaction we read about, there are now countless guides, local guardians and responsible eco-tourism companies showing people how they can experience respectful wildlife encounters while also contributing to their conservation.\nFrom whale-watching in Mexico to lemur-spotting in Malaysia, here are some of the most remarkable wildlife experiences around the globe where rule-abiding travellers are welcome.\nEvery year from May to September, hundreds of thousands of Giant Australian cuttlefish gather in South Australia's Upper Spencer Marine Gulf Park in one of the animal world's most flamboyant sex shows. Closely related to the octopus, these whip-smart molluscs can change colour and texture instantly, and when they mate, the animals are known to pulsate hues and males disguise themselves as females. Nowhere else on Earth can swimmers observe such spectacular and strange mating behaviours en masse as here in Whyalla, and local outfitters offer responsibly guided trips to see them. Learn more here.\nIn El Vizcaino, a protected whale sanctuary in Mexico's Baja California Sur peninsula, grey whales are known to regularly and voluntarily approach fishing boats out of sheer curiosity, sparking new whale-watching tours where the whales are the ones doing the viewing. These unique interactions are helping to fuel conservation and protection of their habitat, as well as providing a safe way for visitors to interact with these majestic gentle giants. Learn more here.\nFound in tiny \"herds\" on a specific type of algae, these miniature sea slugs are named for their fuzzy appearance and black-tipped antennae that resemble sheep's ears. The unique creatures are some of the only animals that can photosynthesise, using chloroplasts from the algae they eat and store in their tissues to grow. The delicate 8mm-long creatures are facing threats from climate change, habitat loss and destructive fishing practices, but divers in marine-protected areas like Maricaban Island in Batangas can still safely spot them in the wild – especially when accompanied by local guides. Learn more here.\nIn spring and autumn, as the sun sets over Denmark's Wadden Sea National Park, a spectacular aerial show takes place. More than 1.5 million starlings take to the air, swooping around in a wave-like synchronised dance, called a murmuration. Though the birds and their dance can be seen in various locations all over the world, the coastal wetlands in southern Denmark is one of the most dramatic places to witness this mesmerising – if somewhat mysterious – natural phenomenon. Learn more here.\nFor many years, the paddling and steering of traditional mokoro canoes used to take visitors to view wildlife in the Okavango Delta were strictly the purview of men. However, recently a number of female mokoro guides (called \"polers\") have started to take up the tradition, leading visitors in search of the elephants, zebras and buffalos who call the Delta's glassy waters home. This change is part of a larger trend across the continent to empower women to participate in eco-friendly safari tourism. Learn more here.\nThe Pantanal stretches more than 140,000 sq km across Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay and is considered the largest wetland on Earth. The northern corner of the Brazilian Pantanal is home to one of the world's most unique safaris. Here, travellers hop aboard Pantaneiro horses as they navigate the wetland marsh, allowing them to keep their eyes peeled for jaguars, giant anteaters, giant otters, tapir, maned wolves and hundreds of bird species of birds.

Instead, it's a unique species found only in forests across South-East Asia. Despite being fairly widespread, very little is known about the large-eyed gliding creature. Nature focused tours like Jungle Walla offer the best opportunities to see them in the wild. Learn more here.\nNearly wiped out in the early 1900s, Ireland's native grey seal population, which experienced a comeback due to federal protection laws passed in 1976, are now in danger again. Climate change is affecting their food supply and increasing storms are separating seal pups from their parents before they're fully independent. For the last 10 years, an organisation called Seal Rescue Ireland has been doing their best to rescue orphaned or injured seals found across the island country. Touring their facility allows visitors to meet some of the rescued pups and learn about their rehabilitation process. Learn more here.\nIf you look into the folded leaves of heliconia plants in Braulio Carrillo National Park, you might come face to face with some of the country's cutest (and most endangered) flying mammals. Honduran white bats, also called the Caribbean tent-making bats, which most closely resemble tiny cotton balls with bright orange noses and ears, were once found across Central America. Now one of the smallest fruit-eating bat species in the world is struggling to survive. Visit Tirimbina Rainforest Center to see the bats in the wild and help contribute to the area's conservation efforts. Learn more here.\nConsidered by the Aztecs to be a representation of Xolotl, god of the underworld, axolotls are a paedomorphic salamander species found in the canals and waterways of Mexico City that appear to be wearing a perpetual grin. Scientists are particularly interested in the species because of its ability to regenerate limbs, eyes and even organs. However, it's a race against time as the native habitat of the tiny amphibians increasingly disappears or is polluted by development. Because axolotls are so endangered, the best place to catch a glimpse of them is in places like the Chapultepec Zoo and the Zoológico Los Coyotes.

{"id": 401, "question": "What is the name of the urban winery that transports grapes from Austria to Finland to make natural wines?", "answer": ["Noita"], "doc": ["Noita Winery harvests hand-picked organic grapes from Burgenland, Austria, and transports them directly from the vine to our winery in Fiskars Village, Finland. Once the grapes arrive, we give them as much respect as our organic growers do.", "Simon - founder, winemaker Ilona - winemaker We’re Finland’s first urban winery, based in the not-so-urban Fiskars Village. Fiskars is a small, creative community of only 600 permanent residents, one hour west of Helsinki. What’s an Urban Winery? Urban wineries are predominantly non-vinyard owning wine producers.", "It also gives the winemakers enormous flexibility, allowing them to harvest grapes from multiple growers across France, Austria, Spain, Italy, Germany and many more wine-producing territories across Europe.", "That means grapes arriving in the village will be used five times! ​ Interested hearing more? Visit us at our production in Veitsitehdas, Fiskars. Check more info at www.veitsitehdas.fi Looking forward to seeing you at the winery!", "As for the Médoc, climb aboard bus 29 departing from Place des Quinconces to reach Château Saint-Ahon, one of the finest urban vineyards, located in Blanquefort!", "Considered the gateway to the world's largest archipelago and renowned for its food scene, Finland's second city is well worth a detour.\nNordic destinations Stockholm and Copenhagen lure millions of visitors a year, many attracted by the cities' upscale design, elevated food scenes and compelling histories. Yet, Finland's first capital and oldest city, Turku, founded in 1229 along the banks of the River Aura, hits the same high notes as its neighbours, but without the crowds.\nWhat's more, this 200,000-person city on Finland's south-west coast is also known as the gateway to the Finnish archipelago: a 40,000-island labyrinth that's considered the largest in the world.\nKnown as Åbo to its predominantly Swedish-speaking inhabitants (a name which aptly means \"living by the river\"), Turku was once part of Sweden in the Middle Ages before becoming an autonomous Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire in 1809. Since Finland gained independence in 1917, the cosmopolitan hub has served as Finland's second city, and thanks to its thriving food and cafe scene and its Seine-like river vibe, the city is sometimes called \"the Paris of Finland\".\nTree-lined boulevards flanked by 19th-Century theatres, coffee shops and market halls – many with a sustainable throughline – fill Turku's compact and walkable centre. I spent an hour flipping through new and used CDs and vinyl at the three-storey 8raita Record Store and shopped for vintage kimonos and theatre costumes, jewellery and dresses at Boutique Minne in the town centre. Nonprofit, cooperative book cafe Turku Kirjakahvila offers literature from Finnish and foreign publishing houses, self-published books and house-baked vegan pastries; Televisio Lifestyle Store sells a multi-chromatic clash of clothes, jewellery, shoes, bags, and gifts from the store's eponymous label and Finnish and Nordic brands Katri Niskanen, Gauhar, Papu Design and NOT.\nSadly, 70% of the city's buildings burned down during the 1827 Great Fire of Turku, but you can see glimpses of the city's distant past at the Museum of Archaeology and Contemporary Art, where the remains of Turku's former medieval city quarter, Aboa Vetus, were discovered following archaeological excavations and are now displayed.\nAbove ground, the 13th-Century granite-and-stone Turku Castle stood guard over the Aura until it was reimagined as a Finnish history museum in 1993. Elsewhere, The Kakolanmäki Hill Museum showcases more recent developments, including the history of Kakola Prison, which was established in 1863 and housed some of the country's most notorious villains and murderers until in 2007. Since then, Kakolanmäki, (\"Kakola's hill\"), has been revitalised. You can opt to stay at the prison's former psychiatric hospital, Forenom apartments, which now offer modern accommodations with a Nordic-chic wood-and-textile aesthetic, or Hotel Kakola, whose upscale rooms are located in the city's former prison (the narrow cell room with simple bunk beds and barred windows is the most requested).\nFrom the hotel, a pleasant stroll north-east along the river's north bank takes you to Turku's granite Art Museum, whose 7,600 works span the \"golden age\" of Finnish art, Finnish Surrealism and pop art at the turn of the 20th Century. A short walk away, Café Art is a seven-time recipient of the national Barista of the Year – a highly anticipated competition, since the Finns rank among the world's biggest coffee drinkers.\nIn the summer, outdoor concerts are held almost daily outside the Turku Cathedral, with plenty of vendors selling locally sourced food and wine. When Finland joined the EU in 1995, its ministers had to decide whether Finland was a Nordic country that received heating subsidies or a wine-producing nation, like France and Italy, which received different grants. Finland's government opted to keep its citizens warm; today, Finland must label homegrown grape wine as \"mild alcoholic beverage fermented from grapes\", prompting entrepreneurs to explore boozy expressions of lingonberries, cloudberries and sea buckthorn, which are slowly garnering attention from international sommeliers.\nIf you fancy a more familiar wine, you'll find that, too. I spent an enjoyable hour supine in a deck chair, chatting with the vintners from urban winery Noita who are skirting the rules by hand-picking organic grapes from Burgenland, Austria, and transporting them to their facility in Finland's Fiskars Village, 112km to the south-east, to make delicious natural Riesling, Grüner Veltliner and other blends.\nThe city's food scene has been attracting international attention lately, too. After tasting-menu restaurant Kaskis earned Turku's first Michelin star in 2022 (Finland's first outside Helsinki), Michelin chose to launch its 2023 Nordic Countries Guide in Turku, highlighting the region's local food culture. In Kaskis's intimate and unassuming space on the ground floor of an apartment building, chefs and founders Simo Raisio and Erik Mansikka pair pristine perch and pike with celery and ingredients foraged sustainably in nearby forests, served on an eclectic mix of recycled plates and Mansikka's hand-made ceramics. Mansikka is something of a posterchild for the ambitions of Turku's dynamic food scene: as I wandered around town, his red Michelin star clavicle tattoo and impish grin decorated displays of pots and pans at kitchen stores all over.\nHe's also a familiar sight at Turku Market Hall, where vendors supply home cooks and top-notch restaurants alike with fresh produce and products. I planned to wander the market's 19th-Century red-brick halls before finding a restaurant for lunch, but instead, the smells emanating from shop-cum-lunch counter Herkkunuotta lured me to pull up a counter chair. Upbeat chef-fishmonger Johan Hellsten and his team develop catch-of-the-day dishes on the fly between wrapping packets of spotted crab and giant shrimp. That day, offerings included perch soup seasoned liberally with fragrant dill, cold-smoked and cured local rainbow trout, and reindeer two-ways: a mousse-filled tartlet, and cold-smoked and sliced with horseradish.\nTurku is renowned for the quality of its local, seasonal ingredients, many of which are farmed or harvested on its nearby islands. In fact, the many thousands of islands and islets encompassing the Finnish archipelago (sometimes called the Turku archipelago) include autonomous municipalities that invite you to choose your own adventure – culinary or otherwise.\nOne of the closest is Ruissalo, part of Turku city (accessible via bus #8 from the city centre) and a former hunting island for Turku Castle's court. One of my favourite ways to spend a Sunday is a massage at Ruissalo Spa before alternating between chilly sea water plunges and mad dashes back to the balmy warmth of the sauna.\nMore like this: • Maakalla: Europe's isolated, autonomous island • The secret meaning behind the World Tree Hugging Championships • The Swedish law of wanderlust\nFrom Turku, Finland's many islands fan west along the Baltic Sea between the Gulf of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland and Åland, an autonomous group of more than 6,500 islands within Finnish territorial waters – only 60 of which are inhabited. Thanks to the city's airport, its twice-daily ferry departures to the region and frequent boat tours of the archipelago, Finland's second city is considered the best gateway to these far-flung isles.\nDespite its lofty latitude, Åland is often sunnier than the mainland. As spring arrives, the region comes alive as 1.5 million visitors swell its inhabited islands through the summer months, most bound for Åland's capital, Mariehamn (Marie's Harbour), which was established by Russia's Czar Alexander II in 1861 and named for his wife. There's plenty to do (I spent my days wandering the ruins of the Czar's granite fortress and exploring glorious parks and museums) and plenty to eat and drink tucked away within the Torggatan pedestrian precinct's red-and-yellow wooden houses.\nÅland is at its most buzzy during its famed three-day Harvest Festival (typically held in September or October), when local farms and cellars open their doors. I stocked up on local prize-winning butter and cheeses; fruit pies filled with local apples, plums and pears; and Venezuelan transplant Mercedes Winquist's chocolate-enrobed berry confections.\nFinland's Everyman's Right gives Finns and visitors alike the freedom to temporarily stay and camp out overnight anywhere – even in public parks and on private property, so long as you don't cause damage or disturb the landowner. The archipelago is also accessible by year-round ferry service from Turku. Winter attracts those who enjoy cross-country skiing, ice-fishing and skating, post-sauna dips in the freezing Baltic or white-knuckling it to drive point-to-point over the frozen ocean when conditions permit.\nBut visiting from spring to early autumn has always been more my speed, when warmer weather signals the opening of The Archipelago Trail: a 250km \"ring road\" connected by a network of huge, free-to-ride electric yellow ferries that glide noiselessly between islands and invite leisurely exploration.\nOn a recent trip, my favourite sojourn was an afternoon spent at Hotel Hyppeis, a renovated village schoolhouse on Houtskär island (roughly three hours by car and ferry from Turku) where co-owners Sam and Outi Fagerlundin host overnight guests in simple rooms decorated with vintage furnishings and rugs woven from upcycled bed linens and towels. In the summer, the hotel's former classroom hosts a series of multi-course dinners showcasing locally sourced lamb, potatoes grown in a field across the street and other products by a rotating cast of visiting chefs.\nDisembarking from a sailboat, I was greeted on the deck by a violinist and staff carrying silver platters of crystal glasses of rose spritz, infused by petals from the garden. The menu that day was roast lamb two ways, Jerusalem artichoke and blue cheese cream soup with pear compote and a salty salmon dish fragrant with little star anise. They were flavours born from this relatively unexplored corner of Europe, and the perfect way to refuel after a day's exploration.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

You can opt to stay at the prison's former psychiatric hospital, Forenom apartments, which now offer modern accommodations with a Nordic-chic wood-and-textile aesthetic, or Hotel Kakola, whose upscale rooms are located in the city's former prison (the narrow cell room with simple bunk beds and barred windows is the most requested).\nFrom the hotel, a pleasant stroll north-east along the river's north bank takes you to Turku's granite Art Museum, whose 7,600 works span the \"golden age\" of Finnish art, Finnish Surrealism and pop art at the turn of the 20th Century. A short walk away, Café Art is a seven-time recipient of the national Barista of the Year – a highly anticipated competition, since the Finns rank among the world's biggest coffee drinkers.\nIn the summer, outdoor concerts are held almost daily outside the Turku Cathedral, with plenty of vendors selling locally sourced food and wine. When Finland joined the EU in 1995, its ministers had to decide whether Finland was a Nordic country that received heating subsidies or a wine-producing nation, like France and Italy, which received different grants. Finland's government opted to keep its citizens warm; today, Finland must label homegrown grape wine as \"mild alcoholic beverage fermented from grapes\", prompting entrepreneurs to explore boozy expressions of lingonberries, cloudberries and sea buckthorn, which are slowly garnering attention from international sommeliers.\nIf you fancy a more familiar wine, you'll find that, too. I spent an enjoyable hour supine in a deck chair, chatting with the vintners from urban winery Noita who are skirting the rules by hand-picking organic grapes from Burgenland, Austria, and transporting them to their facility in Finland's Fiskars Village, 112km to the south-east, to make delicious natural Riesling, Grüner Veltliner and other blends.\nThe city's food scene has been attracting international attention lately, too. After tasting-menu restaurant Kaskis earned Turku's first Michelin star in 2022 (Finland's first outside Helsinki), Michelin chose to launch its 2023 Nordic Countries Guide in Turku, highlighting the region's local food culture. In Kaskis's intimate and unassuming space on the ground floor of an apartment building, chefs and founders Simo Raisio and Erik Mansikka pair pristine perch and pike with celery and ingredients foraged sustainably in nearby forests, served on an eclectic mix of recycled plates and Mansikka's hand-made ceramics. Mansikka is something of a posterchild for the ambitions of Turku's dynamic food scene: as I wandered around town, his red Michelin star clavicle tattoo and impish grin decorated displays of pots and pans at kitchen stores all over.\nHe's also a familiar sight at Turku Market Hall, where vendors supply home cooks and top-notch restaurants alike with fresh produce and products. I planned to wander the market's 19th-Century red-brick halls before finding a restaurant for lunch, but instead, the smells emanating from shop-cum-lunch counter Herkkunuotta lured me to pull up a counter chair. Upbeat chef-fishmonger Johan Hellsten and his team develop catch-of-the-day dishes on the fly between wrapping packets of spotted crab and giant shrimp. That day, offerings included perch soup seasoned liberally with fragrant dill, cold-smoked and cured local rainbow trout, and reindeer two-ways: a mousse-filled tartlet, and cold-smoked and sliced with horseradish.\nTurku is renowned for the quality of its local, seasonal ingredients, many of which are farmed or harvested on its nearby islands. In fact, the many thousands of islands and islets encompassing the Finnish archipelago (sometimes called the Turku archipelago) include autonomous municipalities that invite you to choose your own adventure – culinary or otherwise.\nOne of the closest is Ruissalo, part of Turku city (accessible via bus #8 from the city centre) and a former hunting island for Turku Castle's court. One of my favourite ways to spend a Sunday is a massage at Ruissalo Spa before alternating between chilly sea water plunges and mad dashes back to the balmy warmth of the sauna.\nMore like this: • Maakalla: Europe's isolated, autonomous island • The secret meaning behind the World Tree Hugging Championships • The Swedish law of wanderlust\nFrom Turku, Finland's many islands fan west along the Baltic Sea between the Gulf of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland and Åland, an autonomous group of more than 6,500 islands within Finnish territorial waters – only 60 of which are inhabited. Thanks to the city's airport, its twice-daily ferry departures to the region and frequent boat tours of the archipelago, Finland's second city is considered the best gateway to these far-flung isles.\nDespite its lofty latitude, Åland is often sunnier than the mainland. As spring arrives, the region comes alive as 1.5 million visitors swell its inhabited islands through the summer months, most bound for Åland's capital, Mariehamn (Marie's Harbour), which was established by Russia's Czar Alexander II in 1861 and named for his wife. There's plenty to do (I spent my days wandering the ruins of the Czar's granite fortress and exploring glorious parks and museums) and plenty to eat and drink tucked away within the Torggatan pedestrian precinct's red-and-yellow wooden houses.\nÅland is at its most buzzy during its famed three-day Harvest Festival (typically held in September or October), when local farms and cellars open their doors. I stocked up on local prize-winning butter and cheeses; fruit pies filled with local apples, plums and pears; and Venezuelan transplant Mercedes Winquist's chocolate-enrobed berry confections.\nFinland's Everyman's Right gives Finns and visitors alike the freedom to temporarily stay and camp out overnight anywhere – even in public parks and on private property, so long as you don't cause damage or disturb the landowner. The archipelago is also accessible by year-round ferry service from Turku. Winter attracts those who enjoy cross-country skiing, ice-fishing and skating, post-sauna dips in the freezing Baltic or white-knuckling it to drive point-to-point over the frozen ocean when conditions permit.\nBut visiting from spring to early autumn has always been more my speed, when warmer weather signals the opening of The Archipelago Trail: a 250km \"ring road\" connected by a network of huge, free-to-ride electric yellow ferries that glide noiselessly between islands and invite leisurely exploration.\nOn a recent trip, my favourite sojourn was an afternoon spent at Hotel Hyppeis, a renovated village schoolhouse on Houtskär island (roughly three hours by car and ferry from Turku) where co-owners Sam and Outi Fagerlundin host overnight guests in simple rooms decorated with vintage furnishings and rugs woven from upcycled bed linens and towels. In the summer, the hotel's former classroom hosts a series of multi-course dinners showcasing locally sourced lamb, potatoes grown in a field across the street and other products by a rotating cast of visiting chefs.\nDisembarking from a sailboat, I was greeted on the deck by a violinist and staff carrying silver platters of crystal glasses of rose spritz, infused by petals from the garden. The menu that day was roast lamb two ways, Jerusalem artichoke and blue cheese cream soup with pear compote and a salty salmon dish fragrant with little star anise. They were flavours born from this relatively unexplored corner of Europe, and the perfect way to refuel after a day's exploration.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Here are her picks, from underground jams at Mostovna to Fabrika's famous burgers.\nNova Gorica is one of Slovenia's (and Europe's) youngest cities, but it's grown up fast. Since Slovenia's entry into the EU in 2004, it's become a showpiece for Slovenia's rich artistic tradition stretching from ancient artisanal crafts to master Slovene Impressionists Ivana Kobilca and Franc Berneker to today's thriving contemporary arts scene.\nThe planned city was founded in 1947 after the Paris Peace Treaty established the border between Italy and the former Yugoslavia, restricting travel between the two nations. With the Italian city of Gorizia, a regional centre since the Middle Ages, suddenly off-limits to Yugoslavs, the Socialist Yugoslavian government envisioned Nova Gorica (New Gorizia in Slovenian) as a modernist city to cement a new, postwar identity. For decades, the two cities lived on either side of a tumultuous border; steps apart but worlds away.\nNow, united as the 2025 EU Capital of Culture, Nova Gorica and its sister Italian city Gorizia stand as \"the European capital of borderless culture\". Having these two places, so long separated, share this distinction is a testament to a collaborative future.\nAnd Nova Gorica itself – nestled in the idyllic Vipava Valley, famed for its wineries – has become particularly known for its unique combination of modern artistic edge and small-town community feel.\nWe asked Tish, a singer-songwriter who has called Nova Gorica home since she was a teen, to guide us through Europe's unsung artsy capital. For Tish, a 2025 GO! Ambassador, Nova Gorica is its own best champion. \"Slovenia's past as part of Yugoslavia [means] you never feel out of place here,\" she says. \"It's easy to find Serbian or Slovenian food and hear people speaking Slovenian, English, Serbian and Croatian. Being so close to Italy adds another layer of cultural richness. Nova Gorica is truly a unique place, where the feeling of community is so strong that everyone feels welcome.\"\nThe arts are fundamental to Nova Gorica's identity, and as Tish says, the scene \"feels deeply rooted in the community. You can see art all around the city, especially street art. Cankarjeva Ulica [a main street] is full of graffiti, adding colour and energy.\"\nHere are Tish's top recommendations for a visit to artsy Nova Gorica.\nTrg Evrope, called Piazza della Transalpinain Italian after the trans-European Transalpina train that once stopped there, is a stately square that was cut in two by the border until 2004. Like many of her generation, 24-year-old Tish sees it as the true symbol of her city's history. \"Standing here, you can truly feel the essence of Nova Gorica,\" she says, \"shaped by Italy yet distinctly Slovenian in spirit.\" Anchored by the city's monumental train station built in 1906, the centrepiece of the square is the Mosaic of the New Europe, a marker transferred from the old border and transformed into an evocative piece of collective art. Tish recommends a stop at the classic Caffe Bordo, \"right at the train station, where you can enjoy a cosy coffee break\".\nThe square is currently undergoing a major renovation in anticipation of the 2025 Capital of Culture, where it will become the new ECoC District. Set to be completed by the end of 2024, this vibrant square will connect Italy and Slovenia through accessible green urban spaces, art exhibits and an upgraded railway station in Nova Gorica that will improve transport links around Slovenia.\nFounded in 1980, the Nova Gorica Arts Centre champions Slovenian talent with exhibits and performances, and for Tish, it's quite simply \"the heartbeat of Nova Gorica’s vibrant arts scene\". In her opinion, the diversity of the centre's offering reflects the cultural legacy of Nova Gorica itself: \"a great place to stay in tune with the city's musical pulse, from local indie bands to up-and-coming Slovenian artists\". The Arts Centre also manages the circular Mestna Galerija, one of Tish’s favourite galleries, host of the internationally renowned Pixxelpoint festival and a one-time exhibition space for artists Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol. \"It’s the perfect spot to escape for a while and lose yourself in thought-provoking artwork,\" she says.\nAs the Capital of Culture, Nova Gorica will be bursting with cultural activities throughout 2025. Look out for incredible live concerts from Slovenian and international performers – Patti Smith inaugurated the project with a concert in 2023, so the bar has been set high. There will also be a full calendar of art and film festivals; dance companies; thought-provoking installations around the city; and workshops discussing technology, innovation and solutions for a borderless world.\nWebsite: www.kulturnidom-ng.siAddress: Bevkov trg 4, 5000 Nova GoricaPhone: +386 5 335 40 10Instagram: @kulturnidomng\nNova Gorica doesn't just cater to students and young artists; foodies seeking elevated cuisine are also in luck. \"For a refined dining experience, Michelin-starred Restavracija Dam restaurant, just outside the city centre, offers a modern take on Slovenian cuisine,\" says Tish.

At Fabrika, you're just as likely to find a group of university friends sharing tacos as grandparents tucking into gigantic burgers made from local Slovenian beef.\nTish also loves what Fabrika offers beyond the menu. \"On Fridays, they host a DJ set, and the place is open all day, every day,\" she says. \"So, it's perfect for a quiet morning or a lively night. Located right in front of the main square, which frequently hosts events and live music, Fabrika is the go-to spot.\"\nSlovenia's Alpine rivers make stellar beers, and small breweries are popping up all over the country.

Located in a former industrial facility right on the Slovenia-Italy border, the punky industrial space is a club and meeting point for free spirits and misfits. \"It's a hotspot, sometimes hosting two shows in one day!\" says Tish. \"You can catch anything from rock, soul and orchestral music to comedy and art exhibitions featuring emerging and established artists from all over Slovenia.\"\nYoung musicians like Tish have a lot of support in Nova Gorica. \"There’s plenty of room for growth in Nova Gorica’s creative scene, and the local support is incredible,\" she says. \"Many musicians perform here, and I've had the amazing opportunity to meet and collaborate with some of the most famous Slovenian artists.

{"id": 409, "question": "What is the name of the lagoon where Pacific gray whales come to interact with humans?", "answer": ["Laguna San Ignacio"], "doc": ["For reasons no one can explain, there is a certain percentage of the gray whale population that comes to Baja (known as the eastern Pacific population), that seek out interaction with humans. This phenomena started in San Ignacio lagoon in the 1970's when a lone fisherman had several encounters with a friendly gray whale.", "Words can hardly describe what a friendly Gray Whale experience is like and often questions arise as to why these whales (that should have every reason not to interact with humans) approach our boats to interact with us. Perhaps the Gray Whale has a message of her own and it is in these breeding lagoons that their message is spread to us.", "Credit: NOAA Fisheries Once common throughout the Northern Hemisphere, gray whales are now only regularly found in the North Pacific Ocean where there are two extant populations, one in the eastern and one in the western North Pacific. Gray whales earned the nickname “devil fish” because of their aggressive reactions when harpooned.", "While gray whales have been known to occasionally approach humans elsewhere, according to Swartz, this is the only place where they regularly do so, and where the animals linger and often rise above the water's surface, allowing humans to touch them.", "Today some of the whales approach whale watching boats to play with humans. Mothers often push their young towards the boat. Witnessing this is a thrill. As noted, some gray whales, including those in Magdalena Bay, seek attention from humans and completely alter your perception of whale watching.", "Once nearly hunted to extinction, Pacific gray whales in Mexico's Laguna San Ignacio now seem to be as curious about us as we are about them.\n\"Here she comes again!\" our guide, José Sanchez, announces as a massive gray whale approaches us for the fifth time in 45 minutes. Each time our curious new friend returns to our idle fishing boat, it stays a bit longer on the surface, watching us as we watch her.\nThis is our final outing to see what locals call \"the friendlies\" – the gray whales in Mexico's Laguna San Ignacio. As our boat quietly sits with its engine off, this 40-ton whale playfully rubs up against the sides of the boat, raising the top half of its white-speckled body and cosying up right along the hull as if to check out all six of us onboard. When the whale's eye – which is about the size of a baseball – breaks the surface and meets mine for a moment, I shriek with delight.\nWe're told to give whales distance, but what happens when they come to watch us?\nLocated on the western coast of Baja California Sur's peninsula, the Laguna San Ignacio is considered the last undisturbed breeding and calving lagoon of the Pacific gray whale. The protected whale sanctuary is also home to one of the world's most unusual wildlife encounters: here, curious whales regularly, and voluntarily, seek out contact with humans.\nEvery year from January to mid-April, thousands of gray whales arrive in the lagoon during a 19,300km journey from the icy waters of the Arctic to the warm waters of Baja California Sur to mate and give birth. While these are now safe waters for nursing and breeding, gray whales were once hunted here. Yet, the animals now seem to have learned to trust humans. In fact, during my recent whale-watching trip with Sanchez's eco-tourism company Pure Baja Travels, we witnessed mothers bringing their calves over to boats to present them like proud parents.\nThese unique encounters have influenced the conservation and protection of these gentle giants and spurred a thrilling – and responsible – whale-watching experience like nowhere else.\nFor more than 50 years, gray whales in Baja have shown they seem to be as curious about us as we are them. Marine biologists believe a combination of circumstances contribute to this unique behaviour.\n\"In the lagoon, today, there are no real threats,\" says Dr Steven Swartz, a cetacean researcher who has been studying gray whales at Laguna San Ignacio for 45 years. While gray whales have been known to occasionally approach humans elsewhere, according to Swartz, this is the only place where they regularly do so, and where the animals linger and often rise above the water's surface, allowing humans to touch them.\nWhale-watching is only permitted in a specific \"zone\" of the protected whale sanctuary, and there are strict rules: only 16 pangas (small fishing boats) are allowed in this zone at a time. To not overwhelm the whales, all boats must turn off their motors when whales approach. And most importantly, boat operators don't chase or pursue the whales.\n\"[Guides] put you in the presence of the whales, and let the whales decide if they're going to come over, and say hello or not,\" says Swartz.\nBut why do the whales seem to come and say hello? \"Mammals are curious; they are sentient enough to learn about their environment, and they learn by exploring,\" Swartz explains, adding that mothers pass on this curiosity towards boats and people to their calves. \"[The whales] are capable of remembering.\"\nWhales, in general, are very tactile; they like to rub and touch; that's how they communicate, Swartz says. Pacific gray whales aren't busy looking for food (they do that in the Arctic), so perhaps they're also bored, he suggests. While we cannot know exactly why the whales do what they do, Swartz and other marine biologists all agree the whales approach the boats voluntarily.\nGray whales were nearly hunted to extinction during the 18th and 19th Centuries, and as a result, the animals tended to act aggressively towards humans – so much so that local fishermen even dubbed them \"devil fish\" and avoided them. But in 1972, a man named Francisco (Pachico) Mayoral was out fishing in Baja when a whale surfaced and lingered by his boat. Curiosity compelled him to put his hand in the water. The whale rubbed against Mayoral and stayed by his hand.\nNews of Mayoral's experience spread, and locals, much less afraid, waited patiently to experience similar friendly encounters. \"Gray whales specifically are naturally curious and have never been afraid of approaching floating items in the water. Humans hurt them, and then the gray whales reacted to that interaction,\" Sanchez tells me. \"After [Mayoral's] first peaceful contact, humans started to realise gray whales are not the scary and mad animals we thought they were.\"\nSanchez was the first Mexican naturalist to guide whale-watching tours in the lagoon back in the 1990s, and his own eco-tourism company now has a base camp on San Ignacio Lagoon. \"As time has gone by, humans are becoming less afraid to let gray whales get closer to the point of close contact. I believe this is [also true for gray whales].\"\nIn 1972, the Mexican government created the San Ignacio Lagoon nature reserve, and in 1988, declared the lagoon a whale sanctuary within El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve, the largest wildlife refuge in Latin America. Five years later, it was designated as a Unesco World Heritage Site. The gray whale population recovered and was removed from the endangered species protection in 1994.\nThat year, Mayoral tipped off environmentalists that Mitsubishi and the Mexican government were planning to build a massive salt factory within the nature reserve. The salt mine was thwarted in 2000 by a robust effort from the local and international community – drawing activists from Robert F Kennedy Jr to actor Christopher Reeves to Baja's shores to join the protest. Today, the battle to save Baja's gray whales is considered one of the greatest wildlife conservation success stories of our time.\nMayoral passed away in 2013, but he's been referred to as the \"saviour of gray whales\" and the grandfather of whale-watching in Baja. Ever since his first peaceful encounter, visitors and locals alike have sought out a similar experience in Baja the lagoon. In fact, Mayoral's family is still running whale-watching trips.\nMore like this:• An ethical – and safe – place to swim with whales • The hidden wonders of Mexico's sacred underwater world • Thirteen photos that will make you care about the ocean\nToday, the human-whale encounters in the San Ignacio Lagoon have not only fuelled conservation efforts but also inspired a regulated eco-tourism industry, which provides a meaningful source of income to local communities.\n\"Eco-tourism is the economic basis for the community. [The people here] watch over the lagoon and whales, and work together to coordinate sustainable whale-watching so that they don't destroy or overuse the resource that's providing income for them: the whales,\" says Swartz.\nOn Pure Baja Travel's five-day trips, travellers embark on six whale-watching outings (which give the animals more opportunities to come to you on their own terms) while also learning about the community's conservation efforts in the lagoon. The camp is only open in February through March and then it disappears when the animals migrate in April.\nFrom our tented base camp right on the banks of the lagoon, I awoke nearly every morning to the rumbling sounds of whales in the distance and could see their heart-shaped vapour spouts as we ate dinner. To be sleeping right along their sanctuary was almost as exciting as seeing them an arm's distance away during the day.\nWhile the San Ignacio Lagoon where the gray whales give birth is now protected, continuing to safeguard the animals and support the local communities who guard them is more vital than ever. Climate change is now impacting the lagoon and the gray whales on their migratory path.\nMexican climate activist Xiye Bastida hopes to inspire a new generation to step up and take action by co-producing and starring in a documentary that will be released in the coming months called The Whale Lagoon. At 22 years old, Bastida connects the grassroots conservation efforts that started a generation ago to the climate crisis facing this generation. She joined WildCoast, an international nonprofit organisation that has been a leading force in the gray whale conservation efforts for more than 25 years, to amplify the voices of the community.\nWildCoast's co-founder and executive director Serge Dedina worked to permanently protect 450,000-acres of San Ignacio Lagoon habitat in 2004. helped to successfully lobby the Mexican government for San Ignacio Lagoon to be included in the El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve, the largest wildlife refuge in Latin America, back in 1988. Now he says Laguna San Ignacio is a global model showing how to protect wildlife while creating sustainable development. The organisation helps to train ecotourism guides, enhance outreach and expand women-led mangrove restoration programmes that help fight climate change.\nWith the climate crisis affecting the migratory path of the whales, the restoration of mangroves (which sequester 10 times more carbon than tropical forests) is another battle Laguna San Ignacio area residents are fighting every day, along with needing to regulate development and tourism around the lagoons.\n\"There's something about the whales that makes you feel overwhelmed, with almost a responsibility to take care of them.

{"id": 412, "question": "According to the MBO Partners' Digital Nomads Report, how much has the number of digital nomads grown since the pandemic?", "answer": ["131%"], "doc": ["Since the pandemic started, the number of digital nomads has tripled, growing by 131% from 2019 to 2022, the researchers found. Annual growth leveled out to 2% since 2022.", "Digital nomads are undeniably on the rise. According to MBO Partners’ research study, the number of digital nomads in the US is continually on the rise from 2019 onwards. As expected, the pandemic had the biggest impact recently. The highest increase was noticed in 2020, which saw 10.9 million digital nomads, as opposed to 7.", "Let loose by the shift to remote work during the pandemic, the digital nomad lifestyle entered the mainstream in the post pandemic era, with about 11% of US workers in 2023 describing themselves as digital nomads. (in millions) In 2023, the number of American digital nomads with traditional jobs decreased by 4%.", "“ According to MBO Partners (2020), the pandemic has changed the demographic mix of digital nomads—the number of older digital nomads has decreased, while the number of Millenial and Gen Z nomads has increased. However, older groups are still well represented.", "When we started the MBO Partners' Digital Nomad study series six years ago, digital nomads were considered an eccentric and fringe group of nomadic workers. But digital nomadism is now mainstream, with 18.1 million Americans-a stunning 11% of American workers-being digital nomads.", "Whether seen as a positive or a negative, the digital nomad trend continues with new visas and organisations aimed at this population popping up around the world.\nThe term \"digital nomad\" may seem buzzy, but it actually comes from a book of the same name by Tsugio Makimoto and David Manners that, on its publication in 1997, predicted a future workforce of globe-trotting travellers logging in from abroad. The authors proposed that technological advances and humanity's will to explore would allow for a more mobile workforce. In the nearly three decades since, and with the advent of easily accessible wi-fi and online resources for travellers, the trend has exploded. So, too, has controversy, or at the very least, disagreement around it.\nFor many, digital nomadism is the ultimate dream lifestyle, allowing freedom of movement and the ability to explore the world while earning a living. Meanwhile, others say it contributes to gentrification and overtourism, that it drives up prices and makes cities nearly unliveable for locals. Now, a growing number of nations are upfront about a desire to attract these upwardly mobile visitors and have begun offering new visas for workers, while organisations spring up to attend to their needs.\nThough the necessary technology existed, the digital nomad movement didn't really take off until the 2010s, largely among young people looking for an early-career escape from the decades of 9-5 office work they saw looming before them. \"When we think about our parents, it was about getting into a job, getting that 401k and going up the corporate ladder,\" explained Evita Robinson, Emmy award-winning creator of the NOMADNESS Travel Tribe, a social community for travellers of colour. \"We're really kind of blowing that ideology up in many ways because we aren't waiting to retire to travel and see the world.\"\nBut according to author, speaker and political scientist Lauren Razavi in her book Global Natives: The New Frontiers of Work, Travel, and Innovation, many of the original digital nomads were wealthy white men working either in the tech industry or as a kind of precursor to today's travel influencer, showcasing their glamorous lifestyle while making money selling guides to those interested in doing the same. However, as the possibility of remote work spread, so did the trend of working from anywhere.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic only added fuel to the fire, as worldwide lockdowns proved that more people than ever were able to do their jobs online. Though restrictions lifted and people were able to return to the office – many chose not to. According to commercial real estate solutions provider Moody's commercial real estate market analysis, more than 20% of corporate real estate remains empty, while a 2023 report by MBO Partners,  an enterprise solutions company that services companies with remote workers, estimates that more than thirty-five million people now consider themselves digital nomads.\nWith the increased interest in travel post pandemic and the flexible nature of remote work, it's perhaps no surprise that the trend has grown so quickly. \"Now is the time in our history where we've had the most passports and we've had all of this access,\" says Marquita Harris, a journalist and frequent digital nomad. \"To me, being a digital nomad has given me the opportunity to travel deeper, to understand way more than I ever could when I would just take a vacation for four days somewhere. And I feel like I learned just so much from those experiences.\"\nHowever, not everyone sees the increase of this trend, which the MBO Partner's Digital Nomads Report estimates has grown a whopping 131% since the pandemic, as a good thing. The influx of visitors to places like Spain and Greece have also fuelled heated protests against overtourism. In places like the Dominican Republic, Bali and South Africa, many locals feel that digital nomads have caused a strain on already scarce resources and driven up the prices of goods and housing beyond what they can reasonably afford.\n\"I think, a lot of the same issues that arise when we're talking about tourism in general, when we're talking about digital nomads,\" explains Mechi Annas Estvez Cruz, a writer and native of the Dominican Republic. \"Most of the time they're used to a certain level of comfort. So those Airbnb's that they're going to be looking for are going to be foreign [owned]. So, you come, and you say it's really cheap… cheap for who? With time, as you show up, and then you tell your friends to show up and this place becomes a safe haven for digital nomads, you're actually driving the cost of everything up.\"\nIt's not just happening in the Dominican Republic; across the globe, locals are finding themselves priced out of popular cities and towns. For example, let prices in the Balearic Islands have increased by about 18% in the last year according to a recent report by Idealista.  \nRobinson also sees the dichotomy of this situation: \"This is actually a question about gentrification,\" she told the BBC. \"I see this over and over again in the work that I do. It's heartbreaking actually and it's conflicting, these circumstances in which [visitors are] running the community out.\"\nSo is there a way to be a digital nomad without contributing to inequality and overtourism? Juan Barbed, Co-Founder of ROORAL, stresses the importance of connecting with locals and being part of the community. ROORAL is an organisation that creates infrastructure for remote workers interested in spending time working in struggling rural towns in Spain. For Barbed, the key to ensuring that this model was a help rather than a hinderance to local communities was involving them in the process ahead of time. \"We are not a private initiative that opens up in a place and then we [move in],\" Barbed explained. \"We talk with the leadership of those communities to see if this is something that they want to try. If the answer is no, it's like, OK, bye.\"\nThis more community-based approach is contrary to many earlier organisations and companies that offered long-term lets and hi-speed wi-fi, but often resulted in insular, and expensive, expat communities. However, as the trend grows, the people who make up the digital nomad community has changed, instead of the young male tech workers who started the trend, an increasing number of families are taking up the lifestyle, and organisations like NOMADNESS have greatly improved its diversity, both of which will ideally have a very different impact on the destinations that welcome these groups.\nThis change seems reflected in Harris' thoughts on her time as a digital nomad:  \"[I think it's important to] make sure that you are contributing to the place's, not just economy, but like the culture of a place. You are essentially contributing to gentrification if you're not careful. Look at where you're spending your money and above all, if you're in a place for a month, and you don't at least make one friend there that's from there, I'm sorry, you're not doing it right.\" \nCruz however, is still sceptical: \"How [do you live in a place] in a way that actually respects the dignity of the people who have been receiving uninvited guests since 1492? And trying to do so with grace, may I add, while being exploited. I need anybody who has a powerful passport and engages in travel for leisure to sit with that tension entirely.\"\nWith new visas in countries like Japan and the UAE, aimed at luring mobile international workers on the rise, it's likely that the trend will continue to expand to even more demographics and locations. Though it's possible that the visas will help regulate the number of digital nomads, as well as ensure they're contributing something more to the local economy.\nFor Robinson, the expansion and continuation of this trend is a good thing. However, she cautions that travellers and countries alike need to be a bit more mindful in order to combat the potential negative effects of the digital nomad lifestyle.\n\"I think people need to approach travel overall, but definitely a digital nomad lifestyle, with a sense of consciousness and accountability,\" she said. \"There are ways to do it right, but I think that people are just so… romanticised maybe by the lifestyle and what they can get from it, that they forget that they're coming into somebody else's community, and they also need to think about how they can give back.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Today, while Oktoberfest celebrations are held in many German cities and overseas destinations, Munich's Oktoberfest reigns supreme, attracting roughly six million visitors from all over the world.\nBut the Bavarian capital is so much more than sum of its pints. As the epicentre of the German Baroque movement and a keeper of some of the country's oldest traditions, it boasts an enviable array of both cultural and natural diversions that are sure to keep any visitor entertained in between the chugs.\nTo get to the heart of this vibrant city, we spoke to lifelong Münchner Philipp Lahm, the German football legend who captained the German national team when it won the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\"I grew up very sheltered with my family,\" Lahm says. \"[Munich]'s a big city, but it's not too big… And, of course, it shaped my football career because I had a world-class club in my hometown.\"\nWhile tourism has been a source of tension for some European destinations grappling with its nastier side effects, Oktoberfest remains a source of pride for Munich, and – as Lahm notes – it embodies the \"welcoming\" spirit of the city.\nLahm encourages foreigners visiting for Oktoberfest to follow the local traditions – getting the dress code right, for instance, and eschewing the larger tents for the smaller ones favoured by the locals.\nBut he also hopes visitors will venture outside the Theresienwiese – the 42-hectare site where the festival is held – to discover the Bavarian city's full beauty, from its bustling markets and serene parks to the very stadium where Lahm played for more than 10 seasons.\nHere are Lahm's favourite places in his hometown of Munich.\nFor more than 200 years, locals have been convening at Munich's Viktualienmarkt in the city's Aldstadt (medieval ancient quarter) to stock up on fresh produce.\nWhile the city's market used to be held in its neo-Gothic Marienplatz – the Bavarian capital's unmistakeable symbol – it was eventually moved to a nearby square, where the former farmers' hub has now become renowned for its refined gourmet treats.\nIt's also Lahm's first stop for savouring Munich's culture. \"You can get the whole idea of what Munich is about,\" he says.\nThe market's atmosphere is quaint and demure, with small fountains nestled between more than 100 food stalls, selling all manner of local delicacies, from Bavarian cream doughnuts and cheese spreads (Obatzda), to the famed local white sausage (Müncher Weißwurst) – a reputed hangover cure.\n\"There are lots of different stalls,\" Lahm says. \"There are food and drink options, you can buy fruit and vegetables, so it's a lovely atmosphere in the centre of town.\"\nBeer is never far away in Munich, and, at the end of a stroll, you can enjoy a pint or two under the chestnut trees of the market's beer garden, which is open every day from 09:00 to 22:00.\nWebsite: https://www.viktualienmarkt-muenchen.de/en/home/ Address: Viktualienmarkt 3, 80331 Phone number: +49 89 8906 8205 Instagram: @viktualienmarkt_muenchen\nAt the foot of the Bavarian Alps and bordered by lush forests and rolling hills, Munich is a nature-lover's paradise.\nRoughly 7km from the city centre, the Olympic Park – known locally as Olympiapark and inaugurated for the 1972 Olympic Games – serves as a gateway to the city's more bucolic side.\n\"It's a large park,\" says Lahm. \"The roofs are still the same as they used to be, the stands in the indoor swimming pool are still similar to what they were back then, so the Olympic Park is a wonderful place to be active, but also to experience the history of the Olympic Games.\"\nThe park's 60m-tall hill, Olympiaberg, not only offers unparalleled views of its surroundings, but it also has an added perk: it allows park-goers a peek inside the Olympic Stadium.\nOnce a well-kept secret, videos went viral on social media this summer, showing thousands enjoying Taylor Swift and Coldplay concerts for free from the top of the hill.\nBut for the best views of the city and its surroundings, Lahm advises heading up to the top of the TV tower.\n\"From there you simply have a wonderful view over Munich,\" he says. \"You can [even] see the Alps from there.\"\nWebsite: https://www.olympiapark.de/en Address: Spiridon-Louis-Ring 21, 80809 München, Germany Phone: +49 89 3067 2054 Instagram: @olympiapark\nIt would seem unlikely to associate Munich, which is more than 500km from the ocean, with water sports.\nYet, the city's Englischer Garten (English Garden) allows visitors to try their hand at a seemingly unlikely pursuit: surfing.\nThe sprawling, 3.75sq-km English Garden was opened in 1792, and is a testament to the whimsical, romanticist fantasies of the time, peppered with follies, lakes and pagodas. But among its most striking features is the Eisbach (\"ice brook\"), a man-made river with an artificial wave suitable for surfing – making it particularly popular in the dog days of summer.\n\"[There are] the Eisbach surfers in the middle of the city, a small, fantastic wave where lots of people are surfing and there are many spectators,\" says Lahm. \"It's something very special for me in a big city.\"\nWebsite: https://www.englischer-garten-muenchen-infos.de/en/ Address: Englischer Garten 1, 80538 / (Eisbach) Prinzregentenstr 1, 80538 Phone: +49 89 3866 6390\nWhile Munich might be more typically associated with the colourful folklore of its centuries-old traditions, it is also one of Europe's economic motors and a hub of innovation.

My family and friends were in the stadium, it was [my] first World Cup.\"\n\"I also scored 1-0… just a few kilometres from my home,\" he says. \"And that's something very special.

The view across the entire park, with its lake and sports facilities, was simply breathtaking. At the top we took a short break and read about how Munich came to be selected as the venue for the Olympic Games.", "This naming decision was based on the idea that the name \"Olympiapark\" related well to the central theme of a \"green Olympic Games\". It also related to the central function of the U-Bahn station, which, together with the bus station, served all sports venues and important sectors of the area.", "The name \"Olympiapark\" was related to the city's administrative commission practice for naming metro stations along the U- and S-Bahn (subway and metropolitan railroad) routes in the city area.

{"id": 419, "question": "What was the nickname given to the restored Ecce Homo painting by the Spanish media?", "answer": ["Ecce Mono"], "doc": ["Albeit not, perhaps, the kind of repair meted out by a local artist and churchgoer, Cecilia Giménez. The octogenarian’s botched job left Ecce Homo looking nothing like its old self – a fact that soon turned it into an international media sensation. The French daily, Le Monde, opened the story with the simple headline (in English): “Holy S--t”.", "This summer marks 10 years since the most famous artwork of the 21st century was painted – or, technically, repainted. It was the image that launched a thousand online memes after grabbing the world’s attention in August 2012. I refer, of course, to Ecce Homo, a “restored” 1930s fresco of Christ wearing the crown of thorns.", "The original image, which showed Jesus wearing a crown of thorns before the crucifixion, was commonly known as “Ecce Homo,” or “Behold the Man”; after Ms. Giménez was done with it, it gained a new nickname: “Ecce Mono,” or “Behold the Monkey.” ArtsBeat, a blog about arts and culture, has been archived.", "This combination of two undated handout photos made available by the Centro de estudios Borjanos shows the 20th century Ecce Homo-style fresco of Christ before (left) and after (right) an elderly amateur artist Celia Gimenez, 80, took it upon herself to restore it in the church of the northern Spanish agricultural town of Borja.", "The amateur artist has also said the parish priest granted her permission to execute a restoration of the fresco known as “Ecce Homo,” or “Behold the Man.” According to a report in the Daily Mail, Gimenez told Spanish TV: “We have always repaired everything ourselves here. The priest knew about it. Of course he did.", "As travellers increasingly follow social media feeds and internet memes, the most unlikely of things can become tourist attractions.\nThe docent said she wanted to take our photo. \"To send it to Cecelia in order to let her know what a good thing she did,\" said the woman. \"That people are now coming to this small town in Spain because of her 'mistake'.\" \nI was in Borja, a 5,000-person town in Spain's northern Aragon province. It was here that in 2012, an elderly parishioner and amateur art restorer named Cecilia Giménez captured the world's attention when she chose to touch up a fresco of Jesus Christ titled Ecce Homo in the Santuario de Misericordia church that had deteriorated since it was painted in the 1930s. Giménez had originally proposed to just add some colouring to Jesus' clothing. But as the 81-year-old was working on it, she couldn't help herself: she began repainting the face.\nWhen she took a break from her duties to go on holiday, she returned to find crowds of shocked people and a horde of international press at the church. The restoration looked so different that local authorities initially assumed the painting had been vandalised. Yet, it was just the (unfinished) work of Giménez, who thought she could restore the painting to its former glory.\nInstead, Ecce Homo (\"Behold the Man\" in Latin) was rebranded \"Ecce Mono\" (\"Behold the Monkey\") by the Spanish media. At first this seemed like an art tragedy. The image of the \"Monkey Christ\", as the English-language press deemed it, was all over the internet. Memes were created. Social media mocked it to death. And Giménez became a hermit in her home, stricken with grief from all the ridicule it caused.\nBut then something interesting happened: tourists started turning up in Borja. This small town that had previously welcomed just 5,000 visitors per year suddenly had a surge of travellers coming to see the botched restoration of Ecce Homo. Today, officials say that between 15,000 and 20,000 tourists per year flock to Borja to see the famous flub of a portrait, which is now, like the Mona Lisa and other masterpieces of the art world, behind a protective shield of glass.\nOn a recent trip with my Spanish-born wife to visit her family in the nearby city of Zaragoza, I suggested we take a daytrip to Borja to see the simian saviour. My sister-and-law and her daughter looked at me for a moment before one of them uttered, \"Why would you want to see that?\"\nEver since I saw the post-restoration image of Ecce Homo, I was fascinated by it. I couldn't explain why, but I wanted to see it with my own eyes. Like so many seemingly random things these days, it had become an unlikely tourist attraction.\nIn his book The Tourist: A New Theory of the Leisure Class, sociologist Dean MacCannell writes: \"anything is potentially a [tourist] attraction. It simply awaits one person to take the trouble to point out to another something noteworthy or worth seeing … Sometimes we have official guides and travelogues to assist us in this pointing.\" But more and more often, social media feeds now serve as our travel guides, pointing tourists towards things like unassuming rural villages, quirky roadside attractions and far-flung art installations.\nIn fact, the story of the Ecce Homo is a perfect example of what MacCannell believes motivates many modern travellers to get on a plane or train in the first place: \"All tourists embody a quest for authenticity,\" he writes.\nIn a way, the botched Ecce Homo is as authentic as it gets: a genuine, real thing born from a mistake. And as I was about to find out, that's part of the painting's appeal.\nAn hour and 70km after leaving Zaragoza, we were in the sleepy, medieval centre of Borja. The Santuario de Misericordia is located roughly 5km away and up a hill from town's central plaza. After paying a €3 entrance fee, the docent led us into the chapel and there it was: the \"Monkey Christ\". As we lingered, a dozen or so other tourists arrived to see the monkey messiah.\n\"MoMA in New York was interested in purchasing it at one time,\" the docent told us. \"But it would have caused too much structural damage to move it from the building.\"\nGiménez \"was devastated by the response to her 'mistake',\" the docent added, using air quotes with her hands. \"And that's why we've been trying to convince her that she has actually done a very positive thing for the community. She put Borja on the tourist map.\" She then pointed to a map of the world tacked to the wall. Hundreds of pins were stuck into spots on the globe where visitors have come from to see Ecce Homo. There were so many over North America, Europe, and Japan that you could no longer see country outlines, just the pin heads. In all, visitors from 110 countries have now come to see it.\nWith Ecce Homo now behind glass and a gift shop at the exit, the church in Borja has a staged, ready-for-tourism aspect to it. As we walked toward the exit, we passed through a gift shop selling Ecce Homo-branded coffee mugs, mousepads, keychains, tote bags, wine bottles and T-shirts. There was a machine making a bronze coin with the image of the so-called Monkey Christ. In an adjacent room, an \"Interpretation Centre\" displayed works of art inspired by Giménez's restoration, including a photo of someone dressed in an Ecce Homo costume for Halloween and several paintings attempting to recreate the scene of Giménez restoring the fresco.  \nThere was even a photo stand-in, in which you can put your face in the hole and have a photo of yourself as Ecce Homo. My wife (then girlfriend), Ivana, and I both did it and used the photo as part of our wedding invitation a year later.\nMore like this:• The town that banned influencers • Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers • How a viral ad campaign is teaching us to \"life-see\" not sightsee\nWhen I asked MacCannel why he thought the Ecce Homo had become a tourist attraction, he had a unique take on it, saying that the original artwork, when it was in pristine condition, had previously garnered almost zero attention. \"The pre-botched fresco was understandably not a reason for tourists to visit the church – probably not much a component of the motivation of the devout to visit.\"\nBut by commodifying Ecce Homo and turning this uniquely botched restoration into just another tourist attraction with entrance fees, crowds and selfie-posing visitors, I couldn't help but wonder whether the powers that be in Borja risked squandering the unique appeal and authenticity of the painting itself – the very reason that led me to visit it in the first place. Perhaps that was inevitable, and as I would soon learn, this has had a few positive effects too.\nSince the church began charging visitors a €3 entrance fee and selling souvenirs in 2016, the proceeds have funded new jobs at the church (such as the docent's) and a large portion is donated to the retirement home where Giménez now lives.\nA few other unexpected things have happened since the painting became a tourist attraction, including an increased interest in Giménez's artwork. Shortly after the revelations of the botched Ecce Homo, one of her own paintings sold at a charity auction for $1,400.\nAccording to one article in the Spanish press, for the last few years, Ecce Homo-inspired tourism, image rights and programmes generated €45,000 in 2021 alone for the town of Borja. There's even been an opera written about Giménez and Ecce Homo that premiered in the United States in autumn 2023. When it was performed in Borja a few years earlier, Giménez was in attendance. She loved it.\nAfter leaving the church, we ate lunch at a restaurant in the centre of Borja. Over creamy jamon croquetas (ham croquettes), fried artichokes and glasses of local Garnacha wine – previously the only thing Borja was well-known for – my previously sceptical sister-in-law, Pilar, and her daughter, Ara, made a surprise announcement: they liked our trip to Borja.\n\"I didn't understand why you wanted to see this,\" Pilar said. \"But after hearing about the life of Cecilia and seeing the painting with my own eyes, plus learning about all the people from around the world who want to come here, I totally get it now.\"\nAs Francisco Miguel Arilla, the former mayor of Borja, said to the press: \"In the end, time puts everything in its place.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

It simply awaits one person to take the trouble to point out to another something noteworthy or worth seeing … Sometimes we have official guides and travelogues to assist us in this pointing.\" But more and more often, social media feeds now serve as our travel guides, pointing tourists towards things like unassuming rural villages, quirky roadside attractions and far-flung art installations.\nIn fact, the story of the Ecce Homo is a perfect example of what MacCannell believes motivates many modern travellers to get on a plane or train in the first place: \"All tourists embody a quest for authenticity,\" he writes.\nIn a way, the botched Ecce Homo is as authentic as it gets: a genuine, real thing born from a mistake. And as I was about to find out, that's part of the painting's appeal.\nAn hour and 70km after leaving Zaragoza, we were in the sleepy, medieval centre of Borja. The Santuario de Misericordia is located roughly 5km away and up a hill from town's central plaza. After paying a €3 entrance fee, the docent led us into the chapel and there it was: the \"Monkey Christ\". As we lingered, a dozen or so other tourists arrived to see the monkey messiah.\n\"MoMA in New York was interested in purchasing it at one time,\" the docent told us. \"But it would have caused too much structural damage to move it from the building.\"\nGiménez \"was devastated by the response to her 'mistake',\" the docent added, using air quotes with her hands. \"And that's why we've been trying to convince her that she has actually done a very positive thing for the community. She put Borja on the tourist map.\" She then pointed to a map of the world tacked to the wall. Hundreds of pins were stuck into spots on the globe where visitors have come from to see Ecce Homo. There were so many over North America, Europe, and Japan that you could no longer see country outlines, just the pin heads. In all, visitors from 110 countries have now come to see it.\nWith Ecce Homo now behind glass and a gift shop at the exit, the church in Borja has a staged, ready-for-tourism aspect to it. As we walked toward the exit, we passed through a gift shop selling Ecce Homo-branded coffee mugs, mousepads, keychains, tote bags, wine bottles and T-shirts. There was a machine making a bronze coin with the image of the so-called Monkey Christ. In an adjacent room, an \"Interpretation Centre\" displayed works of art inspired by Giménez's restoration, including a photo of someone dressed in an Ecce Homo costume for Halloween and several paintings attempting to recreate the scene of Giménez restoring the fresco.  \nThere was even a photo stand-in, in which you can put your face in the hole and have a photo of yourself as Ecce Homo. My wife (then girlfriend), Ivana, and I both did it and used the photo as part of our wedding invitation a year later.\nMore like this:• The town that banned influencers • Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers • How a viral ad campaign is teaching us to \"life-see\" not sightsee\nWhen I asked MacCannel why he thought the Ecce Homo had become a tourist attraction, he had a unique take on it, saying that the original artwork, when it was in pristine condition, had previously garnered almost zero attention. \"The pre-botched fresco was understandably not a reason for tourists to visit the church – probably not much a component of the motivation of the devout to visit.\"\nBut by commodifying Ecce Homo and turning this uniquely botched restoration into just another tourist attraction with entrance fees, crowds and selfie-posing visitors, I couldn't help but wonder whether the powers that be in Borja risked squandering the unique appeal and authenticity of the painting itself – the very reason that led me to visit it in the first place. Perhaps that was inevitable, and as I would soon learn, this has had a few positive effects too.\nSince the church began charging visitors a €3 entrance fee and selling souvenirs in 2016, the proceeds have funded new jobs at the church (such as the docent's) and a large portion is donated to the retirement home where Giménez now lives.\nA few other unexpected things have happened since the painting became a tourist attraction, including an increased interest in Giménez's artwork. Shortly after the revelations of the botched Ecce Homo, one of her own paintings sold at a charity auction for $1,400.\nAccording to one article in the Spanish press, for the last few years, Ecce Homo-inspired tourism, image rights and programmes generated €45,000 in 2021 alone for the town of Borja. There's even been an opera written about Giménez and Ecce Homo that premiered in the United States in autumn 2023. When it was performed in Borja a few years earlier, Giménez was in attendance. She loved it.\nAfter leaving the church, we ate lunch at a restaurant in the centre of Borja. Over creamy jamon croquetas (ham croquettes), fried artichokes and glasses of local Garnacha wine – previously the only thing Borja was well-known for – my previously sceptical sister-in-law, Pilar, and her daughter, Ara, made a surprise announcement: they liked our trip to Borja.\n\"I didn't understand why you wanted to see this,\" Pilar said. \"But after hearing about the life of Cecilia and seeing the painting with my own eyes, plus learning about all the people from around the world who want to come here, I totally get it now.\"\nAs Francisco Miguel Arilla, the former mayor of Borja, said to the press: \"In the end, time puts everything in its place.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Here are her picks for the best in Bangkok, from trendy wagyu pad Thai at May Rai to old school Thipsamai.\nFor many visitors to Bangkok, pad Thai – stir-fried rice noodles tossed in a wok with prawn, eggs, peanuts and bean sprouts – acts as the unofficial ambassador to Thailand's vibrant cuisine. But pad Thai wasn't even part of Thai life until the 1930s.\nThe history of stir-fried noodles in Thailand goes back to the Chinese immigrants who introduced rice noodles to the region in the 18th Century. After the end of World War One, military officer Plaek Phibunsongkhram – known as Phibun – led a coup and came to power, ending Thailand's absolute monarchy. While cementing his authority, Phibun aimed to create a strong national identity and modernise the war-ravaged nation to avoid European invasions. So he engineered an economical, filling and nutritious diet, turning to inexpensive Chinese rice noodles and promoted a nationwide \"noodle is your lunch\" campaign, encouraging chefs to make rice noodles more Thai.\n\"Many ingredients in pad Thai like rice noodles belonged to Chinese immigrants. It's very Thai-Chinese,\" says Pam Pichaya Soontornyanakij, a Bangkok-born chef known for her progressive Thai-Chinese cuisine restaurant Potong. \"But it was created to feed the Thai nationality, so people feel more Thai. And it worked.\"\nSince 2002, a \"Global Thai\" campaign to boost Thailand's tourism-heavy economy and the country's image worldwide led to the opening of many Thai restaurants around the globe, leading people overseas to associate pad Thai with Thailand.\nWhile the dish may not have hundreds of years of history, Soontornyanakij says that pad Thai is very cultural. \"I'm proud of pad Thai,\" says Soontornyanakij, who serves a modernised version of the dish at her restaurant, made with shrimp and topped with a Thai flag made of naturally-coloured red, white and blue rice noodles. \"It portrays the struggles and the survival of the Thai people. And it's become a staple today. It represents our landscape, our history.\"\nHere are Soontornyanakij's top picks for pad Thai in Bangkok.\nWhile you can find pad Thai in every nook and cranny across Bangkok, no pad Thai spot is as legendary as Thipsamai.\n\"Everyone usually has the same flavour profile in their pad Thai – sour, salty and sweet – but the magic of pad Thai is the balance of both flavour and texture,\" says Soontornyanakij. Everyone makes pad Thai in their own way, she explains. \"And there's nothing wrong with that, but I love Thipsamai because the noodles are slippery, and not sticky. That means that they add quite a lot of fat.\"\nThipsamai's original version of pad Thai is cooked with softer and tender sen chan noodles from Thailand's Chanthaburi province and prawn oil made to a family recipe – it's the secret to their popularity. The portion of noodles comes enveloped in a thin vellum of egg.\nThere are now several outlets across the city, but Soontornyanakij says that their old town location inside a warmly lit wooden building remains the most iconic. Thipsamai's desire to serve Bangkok residents began nearly a decade ago when a young woman called Samai began selling pad Thai on a boat across one of the city's canals during World War Two. The couple's son Sikarachat Baisamut now continues their legacy.\nWebsite: https://thipsamai.com/Address: 313, 315 Maha Chai Rd, Samran Rat, Phra Nakhon, Bangkok 10200Phone: +66 2 226 6666Instagram: @thipsamaipadThai\nIt's no mean feat to be a groovy hangout in a buzzing megapolis that doubles as a culinary hub. But that's exactly what May Rai is, says Soontornyanakij. Housed in an intimate, neon-lit shophouse in Bangkok's old town overlooking the gleaming Wat Arun temple along the Chao Phraya River, this part-wine bar, part-pad Thai spot is \"quite the contrast\", she says. \"You are going to eat pad Thai in a funky wine bar.\"\nMichelin-starred Thai chef Thitid Tassanakajohn – who's known as chef Ton – runs the restaurant with his brother and serves natural wines from across the world and homemade spirits infused with herbs. Then there's the food menu serving Thai dishes and the bar's fusion pad Thai inspired by their grandmother's dishes – including a pad Thai made of local wagyu.\n\"I went there when it opened, and it's warm, cosy and casual. Chef Ton really didn't promote it a lot so you can say it's still kind of hidden,\" Soontornyanakij says. Pad Thai is usually served with lime, chilli and other condiments on the side to add on as you prefer, \"but he [chef Ton] has it already seasoned for you\".\nAddress: 22 Tha Suphan Alley, Phra Borom Maha Ratchawang, Phra Nakhon, Bangkok 10200Phone: +66 97 293 5549Instagram: @mayraibkk\nAlthough it's not usually eaten on the go, pad Thai is a popular street food sold by small stalls across Bangkok. And for generations, Pad Thai Ratchawong stall, located near the city's Yaowarat area, has been known for serving up the best traditional pad Thai. Bangkok locals are loyal to this spot, Soontornyanakij says.\n\"You usually get very good pad Thai in Yaowarat. That's mostly because it's home to many Thai-Chinese families,\" Soontornyanakij says.\nIndeed, the lively Yaowarat Road that hustles and bustles is the hub of Chinese arts and crafts in Bangkok. It's also part of the world's largest Chinatown. Since Pad Thai is prepared in a wok, Soontornyanakij says it was all done by Chinese immigrants first and passed down to the next generations. \"So even in the most random places, pad Thai here is top-notch.\"\nAt Ratchawong, you can grab one of their rickety plastic stools or take pad Thai home in a small banana leaf basket called a krathong. The noodles here are subtly crumbly with a generous amount of fresh prawn. \"This place is very iconic for people in Chinatown, and locals trust it for their sweet and spicy pad Thai with the aroma of the wok,\" Soontornyanakij says.\nAddress: 136 Ratchawong Rd, Chakkrawat, Samphanthawong, Bangkok 10100Phone: +6681 253 5961\nIn 2023, Bangkok received more than 28 million visitors, but even in this tourist-popular city, there are many spots known only to locals, like Lueng Pha Pad Thai. Although it's right beside Thipsamai on Maha Chai Road, Soontornyanakij says it's not really popular with tourists. \"You'll mostly only find Thais here.\"\nA fan-cooled hole-in-the-wall with washed out lime green walls and a few tables outside on the footpath, Lueng Pha is the kind of unexpected gem you come across while aimlessly meandering the city on foot. Run by a family for more than 40 years, this pad Thai-only spot dishes out affordable rice noodles cooked with prawn fat, served wrapped in an omelette or tossed with egg. Your noodles also get cooked in the front of the store over a charcoal burner.\n\"It's so good that you'll find Thai food bloggers on Facebook making videos. They'll compare what's best – the famous Thipsamai or Lueng Pha,\" Soontornyanakij says. It's also the spot to grab pad Thai in the neighbourhood if you don't want to stand in long queues.\nAddress: Maha Chai Rd, Samran Rat, Phra Nakhon, Bangkok 10200Phone: +66 85 213 1621\nThere are several outlets across the city now, but the neon-lit Pad Thai Fai Ta Lu on Dinso Road is where to go for pad Thai full of smoky flavour.\n\"It's how they wok it,\" Soontornyanakij says. Pad Thai Fai Ta Lu loosely means \"pad Thai with high flames\" – and, true to its name, this kitchen's blazing flames engulf the wok full of noodles, prawns and pork, making it feel like an elevated art form. \"It's standalone top-quality street food,\" Soontornyanakij says, \"done by chefs with very good wok skills.\"\nThis retro-style restaurant with lively nighttime music is the brainchild of Bangkok-born chef Andy Yang, who got his first Michelin star for New York City's Thai bistro Rhong-Tiam in 2010. In Bangkok, Yang's wok-made pad Thai are full of great quality pork and prawn, like the Pad Thai Kode Moo Yang, with charred umami-flavoured pork loin marinated in coriander and soy, or Pad Thai Goong Yak, served with a single, giant fresh river prawn. \"The ingredients are fancy, and [chef Andy Yang] stir-fries prawns in their shell, which makes it super flavourful,\" Soontornyanakij says.\nPad Thai Fai Ta Lu also garnered a Michelin Bib Gourmand for five consecutive years in the Michelin Guide. \"And when you dig in, you can smell it all.

Pad Thai Fai Ta Lu loosely means \"pad Thai with high flames\" – and, true to its name, this kitchen's blazing flames engulf the wok full of noodles, prawns and pork, making it feel like an elevated art form. \"It's standalone top-quality street food,\" Soontornyanakij says, \"done by chefs with very good wok skills.\"\nThis retro-style restaurant with lively nighttime music is the brainchild of Bangkok-born chef Andy Yang, who got his first Michelin star for New York City's Thai bistro Rhong-Tiam in 2010. In Bangkok, Yang's wok-made pad Thai are full of great quality pork and prawn, like the Pad Thai Kode Moo Yang, with charred umami-flavoured pork loin marinated in coriander and soy, or Pad Thai Goong Yak, served with a single, giant fresh river prawn. \"The ingredients are fancy, and [chef Andy Yang] stir-fries prawns in their shell, which makes it super flavourful,\" Soontornyanakij says.\nPad Thai Fai Ta Lu also garnered a Michelin Bib Gourmand for five consecutive years in the Michelin Guide. \"And when you dig in, you can smell it all.

Connecting the archipelago from Arholma island at its northern end to Oja in the far south by waymarked paths for the first time – and becoming one of the world's only archipelagos to be linked end-to-end by trail – the SAT will open up the islands to the public like never before. \nWhile the archipelago has been long used for leisure by boaters and beachgoers, the establishment of the 270km SAT sends the message out loud and clear that these islands are perfect for deeper exploration by foot. The route will run across 21 islands representative of the archipelago's abundant natural beauty, and in so doing will also showcase the need to protect its fragile ecosystems.  \n\"We want to encourage everyone to walk here to raise the profile of the islands,\" said SAT creator Michael Lemmel. \"Many people already come, but often use the islands in particular ways. For example, it is popular to visit by private boat, but those who do so will likely travel no more than 50m inland from the boat dock. The SAT [will] spread visitors out over a wider area than just, say, a marina.\"\nLemmel and other proponents of the SAT believe the archipelago – a 1,700-sq-km span of tree-carpeted islands and rocky islets edged by sandy beaches and etched by skerry-peppered bays – has huge potential to redistribute the Stockholm region's influx of tourists more evenly. \"The archipelago tourism window is very specific: an eight-week boom from late June to August and almost nothing the rest of the year,\" Lemmel said – but the walking season extends from May to September or October, meaning the route will take pressure off hotspots and peak visiting times.\nDespite the archipelago being a regional highlight, a 2022 Visit Stockholm survey found that while 81% of overseas visitors to Stockholm sightsee in the city, only 26% take a boat ride out to see its islands. And there is so much to see and do there: basking on the beaches of Sandhamn and Nåttarö; kayaking across island-speckled bays; relaxing in remote cabins where views of sea, sky, forest and birdlife loom large through the windows; and, above all, soaking up the pervading sense of tranquillity that's harder to find elsewhere in the vicinity.\nVisitors cannot bring cars across to the islands the SAT traverses, boats can only dock at certain points and the route is unsuitable for bikes, which makes walking the best way of getting around, whether that's for adventurers keen to trek the entire island-to-island route or more leisurely outdoor-lovers wanting to walk just the stages that appeal to them. Paths have been made welcoming with impeccable signage and strategically placed benches to take in the view. At the same time, the SAT's own environmental impact is negligible. Waymarks (blue for the sea, yellow for the sand) are attached to trees on removable bands so as not to permanently scar the trunk and the route follows pre-existing human and animal paths so new ones did not need to be cut.\n\"Making the trail is also a means for people vested in protecting the islands to subsist on the archipelago for much of the year,\" added Marie Östblom from the Stockholm Business Region, which is overseeing the trail's implementation. \"Walkers will spur extra demand for sub-businesses like lodgings and localised tours. Most islands have few residents, so making important decisions about everything, conservation included, then becomes more efficient.\"\nIn six days, I was able to hike the SAT across six islands – Finnhamn, Grinda, Sandhamn, Utö, Alö and Nåttarö – taking in more than a quarter of the entire route. So numerous are the islands and so thick the forest cover on most that locals say the only sure way to identify somewhere from the water is by the shape of its trees – but when I was on them, I found each island possessed distinctive traits.\nFinnhamn is the only archipelago island with oak trees, and huge rocky outcrops burst out of its forest floor, making for a thrilling hike. Grinda is a gentler mixture of forest and agricultural land. Both are nature reserves. Sandhamn is the most touristed island, yet the sandy pine forests stippling its south and west sides are serene and exquisite. Neighbouring Utö and the Ålö-Rånö nature reserve ratchet up the drama with deep skerry-strewn inlets and higher elevations that set up the archipelago’s finest panoramas. Meanwhile Nåttarö’s pine and birch fringed white sand beaches are unparalleled, and the island has become one of Sweden's first marine nature reserves.\n\"We want to bring people out here to see these treasures for themselves,\" Lemmel said. \"It's harder to care about conserving the islands without appreciating what they offer, and right now even Stockholmers don't know so much about them. We've got thousands of islands – some also on the SAT – that are wildernesses, within a short boat ride of a capital city. How many places can say that?\"\nDespite their natural beauty and their status as a wildlife bastion for seabirds, including Sweden's most significant sea eagle population, the archipelago is vulnerable to pollution. Its intricate web of waterways means polluted water from the Baltic Sea and from over-fertilisation in the Swedish river system can get trapped here. But this has often meant the archipelago has become a drawing board for developing long-term solutions to ecological threats. \nOn Utö, the SAT emerges from forest to encircle a man-made wetland home to a seminal scheme that, according to its creator Thomas Hjelm, can rejuvenate sea life across the entire Baltic. Through introducing top-level predator fish that had been fished to near-extinction like pike and perch and releasing them into the sea through the wetland, he has created a self-sustaining circulatory system. This decontaminates water within the fish's swimming radius of about eight kilometres, as these predator fish reduce algae levels. Wetland reeds grow quickly, too. When cut, Hjelm told me, they can make a viable alternative for fertiliser without the CO2 that turf-cutting, the standard means of creating fertiliser, releases.  \n\"This wetland is the blueprint to show others how it can be done,\" said Hjelm. \"But several hundred of these around the Baltic seaboard would make a massive improvement.\" \nThe Sandhamn section of the trail is the busiest due to the popularity of the island's pretty port and beach. One of Sandhamn's main hotel owners, Lena Josefsson of Sandhamn Seglarhotel, told me that offering a sustainable travel experience was more challenging on the archipelago because of how basic services – recycling facilities and larger supermarkets, for example – were often located a boat ride away on the mainland. \nMore like this:• An award-winning 1,400km hike into the wilds of Eastern Europe• A new chance to hike Europe's ancient salt route• France's centuries-old mountain farm stays\n\"We've come up with a few schemes,\" she said. \"We've just started to get all the food waste from our restaurant collected and made into fertiliser. Also, we're opening an off-grid retreat on a lighthouse offshore from Sandhamn. We hope this will attract a different type of guest, one with a lower carbon footprint.\"    \nAs I walked the SAT, I took Lemmel's point about needing to see the archipelago to care about its ecological value. \"Amazon\" and \"Arctic\" are environmental trigger words: the Stockholm Archipelago is currently not. And this is what the trail does: it lets visitors experience the wonder of the trees giving way to a serendipitous beach or a silent inlet thronged by eider ducks; and, more importantly, it makes them think about why these things are so precious.\n\"And now is the best time to come,\" smiled Östblom. \"Late August to October is our magic season.

Crowded noisy spaces, complicated social interactions and sudden changes in routine are particularly trying for neurodivergent travellers, including those on the autism spectrum.\nAutism is a complex condition marked by differences in communication, social interactions and sensory input. According to the World Health Organization, it affects approximately 1% of children worldwide. The range and severity of symptoms vary, which means the specific accommodations needed by travellers need can also differ.\nTravel can also be very rewarding for autistic people, especially when their needs and sensitivities are taken into consideration. \"I think one of the greatest advantages of travelling is it gives us the opportunity to expand on the idea of what autistic people are capable of,\" said Kerry Magro, a best-selling author and speaker who was diagnosed as autistic at the age of four. \"[It can help with] social abilities, communication, adaptability and also just self-awareness of who they are as individuals and what they like to do.\"\nSome basic knowledge and simple accommodations can make all the difference in autistic people's travel experiences, and destinations are increasingly working to provide these to their visitors. For more than 20 years, the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards (IBCCES) has been providing training to hotels, travel professionals and visitor bureaus across the globe who are interested in becoming more welcoming to autistic and other neurodivergent visitors. Currently more than 300 businesses are listed as Autism-Certified Centres, as well as three fully certified destinations, though there are a few more currently in the process of becoming certified, including Dubai and the Greater Palm Springs area in the US.\n\"We incorporate best practices from experts in the field, as well as autistic and neurodivergent individuals themselves [in our trainings],\" Meredith Tekin, president of IBCCES, told the BBC. \"So, you'll see individuals sharing their lived experience and sharing their recommendations in the trainings.\"\nIBCCES offers trainings focused on sensory awareness and general sensitivity towards autistic people.

Once the trainings are completed, the organisation offers certification and lists businesses on the site Autism Travel, which compiles destinations and attractions that IBCCES deems are \"autism certified\".  \nIBCCES offers autism certifications for restaurants, shops and attractions (called \"Autism Certified Centers\"), as well as destinations and cities. \"Certified Autism Destinations\" are places where most tourism-related organisations in the area have received training, whereas \"Autism Certified Cities\" are given to places where organisations and businesses across the city have been certified.\nThe most recent destination to receive certification is Traverse City, Michigan, which earned certification in August 2024. Traverse City is known for its beautiful natural landscape and proximity to Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. According to Whitney Waara, chief operating officer of Traverse City Tourism, the impetus for becoming an autism-certified destination was simply the wish to have more people able to enjoy the city. \"We were really working on trying to make sure that our destination is welcoming to all,\" said Waara. \"Making sure that we're ready to meet all the travellers that are coming with whatever needs that they have [has] been an important priority for us for the last several years.\"\nThe initiative was a particularly exciting project for Craig Hadley, executive director of Traverse City's Dennos Museum, whose son is on the spectrum and appears in the city's promotional video highlighting its recent certification. \"It seems like a simple thing, but as a parent, it means a lot knowing that the person that you're speaking to understands kind of where you're coming from and why that resource is important for that family,\" Hadley told the BBC.  \nThe museum participated in the certification process, training employees and implementing autism-friendly amenities like quiet spaces, sensory maps and several sets of noise-cancelling headphones available for visitors who are particularly sensitive to sound, as many autistic people can be. The Dennos Museum has also planned a few autism-friendly events, such as its sensory-friendly Halloween For All.\nTraverse City took inspiration from Mesa, Arizona, which became the US's first autism-friendly city in 2019 when it was certified by IBCCES.

{"id": 432, "question": "How long did the period of the Lithuanian language ban last under Russian rule?", "answer": ["39 years, from 1865 to 1904"], "doc": ["From 1865 to 1904, the Lithuanian language (which is actually related to ancient Sanskrit and diverged thousands of years ago) was banned under the tsarist Russian rule, which controlled large swathes of the country at the time.", "The prohibition on printing in the Lithuanian language reflected the Russian nationalist policy of \"restoration\" of the supposedly Russian beginnings of Lithuania. The tsarist authorities implemented a number of Russification policies, including a Lithuanian press ban and the closing of cultural and educational institutions.", "The Russification policy pursued by the Russian government included the banning of the publication of Lithuanian books in Latin characters in the late 19th century. Lithuanian language publications still appeared out of Vilnius, which was controlled by Poland during some of this period.", "The ban created a well-defined and organized opposition to Russian rule and culture—the opposite of its original intent. The Lithuanian historian Edvardas Gudavičius has described the ban as a test of the concept of Lithuania: had there been no resistance, the language would have become a historical footnote.", "Valančius (1801-1875), who was born near Salantai, became very active in the writing and publishing of Lithuanian material, especially after the Russian government banned the use of the Latin alphabet in 1864.[10] This ban on the Lithuanian free press began a unique forty year period in Lithuanian history.", "For nearly 40 years, daring smugglers transported nearly 40,000 Lithuanian-language books into the nation each year when it was forbidden under Russian rule.\nFollowing the gentle bends of the Nemunas, Lithuania's largest river, the Panemunė road stretches for more than 100km and marks the former border between Lithuania and East Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Considered the most romantic road in Lithuania by locals, it travels past a series of 17th-Century castles, Renaissance-era mansions and postcard-worthy towns.\nYet, the route is perhaps best known as the site of a remarkable movement that took place in the late 19th Century and helped save Lithuanian, which is commonly considered the world's oldest surviving Indo-European language.\nPanemunė was built in the early 13th Century along a chain of early medieval fortresses and castles designed to protect the Grand duchy of Lithuania from the invading Teutonic forces coming from Prussia. By the 1800s, it had developed into a major trade and travel route as the fortresses became mansions for the nobility, and smaller towns grew around them.\nAmong the road's many regal attractions are the Castle of Panemunė, a 17th-Century manor complete with intricate frescoes and a park with cascading ponds that's been transformed into a lavish hotel and artist residence. Ten kilometres east of the castle, Raudone (\"The Red Castle\") is a 16th-Century fortress that was partially destroyed during World War Two but has since been rebuilt and now offers horseback riding, archery lessons and a weekly food and arts fair.\nA further 20km east, the ancient city of Veliuona and the castle hill of Seredzius come into view, where a 30-minute hike up the wooden steps to the top of the lush green hill reveals sweeping views of the Nemunas river below. As the road unfurls in one final sweeping bend before the city of Kaunas, the towers of the Raudondvaris Castle emerge. Built where the Nemunas and Nevezis rivers meet, this sprawling 17th-Century estate now features a concert hall, labyrinth park, museum and a restaurant.\n\"The Panemunė road is often called the 'paradise road' in Lithuania: it boasts exceptional scenery, rich history and countless cultural experiences ranging from the [Honey Valley]; boat trips along River Nemunas; [and] local dandelion wine tastings; to art and history museums, food fairs and cultural events in the Renaissance mansions along the road,\" said Eglė Speičienė, founder of the local travel agency TavoGidas. Because of the many castles, rolling hills and boutique wineries located along the Panemunė, Speičienė says some travellers liken the road to France's famed Loire Valley.\nHowever, stunning scenery and dreamy castles aren't the only thing Panemunė is known for. The road is also where a unique Lithuanian movement took place in the late 19th Century that would help shape the nation's character: book smuggling.\nFrom 1865 to 1904, the Lithuanian language (which is actually related to ancient Sanskrit and diverged thousands of years ago) was banned under the tsarist Russian rule, which controlled large swathes of the country at the time. The ban prohibited the printing, possessing and distributing of any publications in Lithuanian with the Latin alphabet – but instead of creating a complete Russification of the country, it had the opposite effect.\nA large network of resistance publishers, book smugglers and distributors sprang up and more than three million books, scientific papers, textbooks and newspapers were printed in Lithuanian in East Prussia and the US, which each had large populations of Lithuanian émigrés. According to historian Vytautas Merkys, during this 39-year-period more than 40,000 Lithuanian-language publications were smuggled into the country each year, reaching villages, parishes and towns across the nation via the Panemunė road.\nPanemunė's proximity to both East Prussia and Poland, (where the books entered) helped it serve as an entry point into the nation for book-smugglers. Tilžė (now Sovetsk, Kaliningrad) was one of the main points where smugglers crossed, and the road's final point, the city of Kaunas, served as Lithuania's capital from 1919 to 1940 and was a centre for cultural resistance against the Russians.\n\"Essentially, Panemunė was the main artery through which the Lithuanian printed press and books reached the country. River Nemunas was a crucial point for crossing into the country. Some book smugglers swam across, carrying bundled-up books on their bodies, while some transported books hidden in steamboats or paid merchants to help,\" explained Vaidas Banys, a historian and educator. \"[These] banned books, newspapers and religious texts reached deep into the country.\"\nAccording to Banys, these book smugglers were key to saving the Lithuanian language. They frequently carried up to 80lbs of printed Lithuanian books and other publications, smuggling them from East Prussia and other border locations across the Nemunas river, then transporting them along the backroads of Panemunė in horse-drawn carts hidden among stacks of hay, furniture or even empty coffins.\n\"All routes were intricately connected, and no book smuggler worked alone. It wasn't just the person who smuggled the books across the border or carried them on their bodies. There were people who would carry the printed materials for a leg of the way, further distribute the prohibited press, finance the printing or supply local communities, parishes and schools,\" Banys said. \"There [wasn't] a 'typical' book smuggler profile, either: people involved in the printing and transporting of the books came from all backgrounds – from simple peasants and devout women to landowners, priests, merchants, bankers and doctors. The network spanned thousands of individuals and organisations. That, in the end, was why the Russians eventually gave up and lifted the ban – the network was so vast and well-connected that it was impossible to destroy.\"\nAccording to Banys, crossing the border was the most dangerous part of the journey. If caught, book smugglers could be shot on sight by Russian officials, imprisoned, tortured and banished to Siberia.\nMore like this: • The chefs reclaiming Lithuania's cuisine • The European region where young people are happiest • Užupis: A tiny republic of free spirits\n\"A book smuggler had to know the smallest details – when the border guards would be changing, which ones could be bribed, which trails or river crossings were watched more closely. Even inside the country, they had to be careful who to trust, how to transport the books and press – using double floors in carts and boxes, paying Jewish merchants aboard the Nemunas steamboats, hiding the books under haystacks and merchandise,\" Banys added. \"The severity of the punishment, when caught, also depended on the kind of books they carried: religious materials were considered less of an offense, and a book smuggler might get away with a fine or a few years of imprisonment. Newspapers and literature that promoted the ideas of freedom, democracy, Lithuanian national identity and the like usually carried a death sentence or deportation to Siberia.\"\nAccording to Banys, these book smugglers didn't just save the language – they helped solidify Lithuanian identity, and, ultimately, its battle for independence.\n\"Although many of the fates of the book smugglers were tragic, their contribution and their memory remain vital. During the years of the language ban, one book smuggler from Kėdainiai was caught by the Russian officers and beaten so severely he went mad. Even when the ban was lifted, this man would still wander around with books on his back, and people would tell their kids: look what our language has cost us; study it and cherish it,\" Banys said.\nWhen the Lithuanian language ban was lifted in 1904, Juozas Masiulis, one of the prominent book smugglers, opened his own book store in the town of Panevezys. The shop is now Lithuania's oldest bookstore. It's still operational today, and every year on 16 March, the nation commemorates the Day of the Book Smugglers.\nThe river ferry near Vilkija – the only remaining Nemunas ferry – is now a popular attraction along the Panemunė road, and travellers can experience what it must have been like to cross the river on smaller boats. In Kaunas, the final stop along the Panemunė road, visitors can also see the Wall of the Book Smugglers – a monument honouring those who perished on their perilous journeys.\nToday, this scenic drive lives on as a living testament to Lithuania's rich culture, complex history and defiant spirit.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

However, the true centre of German beer culture lies three hours north in the medieval town of Bamberg. The first time I try Rauchbier (smoke beer) I am sitting in the dimly lit Schlenkerla – a 600-year-old tavern in the heart of Bamberg's old town.", "\"According to an old proverb, you have to drink three Seidlas (half litre) to get used to the taste,\" says Matthias Trum, owner and brewmaster of Schlenkerla, whose family has run the tavern for six generations. Rauchbier is the signature brew in a city with an unrivalled brewing tradition.", "Take a boat tour on the river Regnitz to appreciate Klein-Venedig (Little Venice), a picturesque row of restored fisher houses along the river.

Fortunately, I am in the latter group.\n\"According to an old proverb, you have to drink three Seidlas (half litre) to get used to the taste,\" says Matthias Trum, owner and brewmaster of Schlenkerla, whose family has run the tavern for six generations.\nRauchbier is the signature brew in a city with an unrivalled brewing tradition. While Munich is often thought of as the heart of German beer culture, with millions of tourists descending on the Bavarian capital every year for Oktoberfest, the true centre of German brewing lies in this Unesco-listed medieval town to 230km to the north. Bamberg is a sophisticated and relaxing alternative for beer enthusiasts who prefer quality and variety over sheer quantity.\nUnlike its southern cousin, where six breweries control the production and distribution of beer in and around Munich, Bamberg is home to 10 family-owned breweries within the city centre and 174 in the surrounding Upper Franconia region, producing an estimated 2,500 different beers. With the highest density of breweries found anywhere on the globe, the region lays claim to the unofficial title of \"Beer Capital of the World\".\nAccording to Trum, before the Industrial Revolution, every beer brewed in Northern Europe was a Rauchbier, the result of a malting process that involved drying green malt – barley that has been germinated but not yet dried – in a kiln heated by a beechwood fire. It was only after the first smokeless malt kiln was patented by Sir Nicholas Halse in England on 23 July 1635 that smokeless beers became the new standard and Rauchbier faded into obscurity.\nWhile some craft breweries still produce smoke beer today, there are just two breweries in the world brewing it according to traditional methods with their own malting operations – Schlenkerla and Brauerei Spezial, another Bamberg brewery.\nWhy this tradition survived in Bamberg is unclear. One explanation is economic: the Industrial Revolution started much later in the Germanic states than in England so old brewing methods survived longer. The other is tinged with nostalgia.\nThe walls of Schlenkerla are adorned with sketched city maps and artwork collected by Trum's great-grandfather, Michael Graser, who ran the brewery in the early 20th Century and went to great lengths to maintain the tavern's 14th-Century aesthetic. The art collection, which depicts life in medieval Bamberg, speaks to a spirit of preservation that has been passed down through the generations and continues to influence brewing practices to this day.\n\"Our modern lifestyle goes hand-in-hand with mass production,\" Trum explains. \"This makes our everyday products more affordable, but the result is a natural loss of diversity. It's really sad when flavour diversity is lost, which is why it's important to preserve old flavours.\"\nIn 2017, Rauchbier was added to Slow Food's Ark of Taste, which aims to preserve and raise awareness of culinary traditions in danger of being lost in the modern world. In this spirit, Schlenkerla and Spezial have joined forces every year since 2021 – on 23 July, the day the smokeless kiln was patented – to celebrate Smoke Beer Preservation Day with a programme of events including brewery tours, beer tasting and a Rauchbier-inspired menu.\nWhile Rauchbier is synonymous with Bamberg, the town's other breweries offer many more varieties and specialty brews to suit every taste. \"Not everyone here likes Rauchbier,\" says local tour guide Christine Conrad, who invites me to try a delicious beer-filled truffle in Café am Dom. \"Everyone has their favourite beer and brewery. We are very patriotic about our beer diversity; that's what sets Bamberg apart.\"\nThis diversity is the result of an exception to an ancient law. Across Europe, beer was historically brewed in monasteries and tied to land ownership. However, Bamberg's surrounding villages were not subjected to a so-called Meilenrecht (\"mile right\") – a law imposed by the city authorities that restricted brewing rights within a one-mile radius of the town to a privileged group of brewers – as strictly as in other parts of Europe. The reason for this is simple: they couldn't enforce it.\nDue to Bamberg's location on busy medieval trade routes, beer consumption levels in the region were higher than elsewhere and brewers within the city were unable to cope with demand alone. This gave guesthouse owners in the surrounding areas leverage to ignore the Meilenrecht and sell their own beer. Over time, the number of such establishments grew, which explains to some degree the high density of family-owned breweries in the area and subsequent absence of larger, corporate breweries.\nFor practical reasons, many of these breweries stored their beer in the seven hills surrounding Bamberg. Firstly, the narrow-cobbled streets of the old town were not suitable for transporting large quantities of beer and, more conveniently, early brewers discovered a network of tunnels in the hills created by sandstone quarrying in the Middle Ages. The cool temperatures of the Felsenkeller (rock cellars) were perfect for fermenting and storing beer.\nSome of those breweries opened beer gardens on the hills directly above the rock cellars, giving rise to another unique quirk. In Bamberg, you don't go to the beer garden, you go auf den Kellern (\"on the cellars\"), meaning a leisurely afternoon spent drinking beer under the shade of chestnut trees has the added bonus of spectacular city views.\nIt's deep in the chilled cellars of the Hellerbräu brewery on Stephansberg – one of the seven hills – that I get my second taste of Rauchbier. The taste is cleaner and more familiar this time, a combination of my taste buds adjusting and the fact that the beer has not yet fully matured.\n\"This one needs another week or two,\" says Martin Knab, a retired brewmaster who gives brewery tours in his spare time.

The era had many lessons to impart on how we can live life in a better and more environmentally friendly way.", "This cabin openly celebrates its jettisoning of conventional holiday mod cons in order to emulate the lifestyle of those that first settled in Norway's wilderness nearly two centuries ago. And her guests, Botnehagen told me, will be all the better for it. Haukali 333 is based on the design of a husmannshus or smallholder's cabin.", "Reidunn Botnehagen's family have farmed this land for more than a century and, like many living amidst south-west Norway's entrancing scenery, also have a countryside cabin here that they rent out to holidaymakers.

The approach to my accommodation for the night was similar to the ascent into any valley in the Norwegian fjords.", "The beds, accessed by a ladder, were built into the walls head-to-foot as they would have been in the mid-1800s for warmth and covered in fleeces from the Botnehagen family sheep. There was no TV, but 19th-Century evening entertainment in the form of a rokk or spinning wheel for spinning wool into clothes.", "One family hopes to show people how a return to basic mid 19th-Century life can teach us much about how to care for our environment today.\nThe approach to my accommodation for the night was similar to the ascent into any valley in the Norwegian fjords. Precipitous rocky mountainsides thick with conifer forest increasingly pressed the narrow road to the shores of Haukalivatnet lake. Yet somehow, enfolded in the valley's upper reaches before the increasingly steep gradient precluded the possibility of settlement altogether, I arrived at some gentler, fertile land.\nReidunn Botnehagen's family have farmed this land for more than a century and, like many living amidst south-west Norway's entrancing scenery, also have a countryside cabin here that they rent out to holidaymakers. But Haukali 333, as they've named it, is not just another country escape. This cabin openly celebrates its jettisoning of conventional holiday mod cons in order to emulate the lifestyle of those that first settled in Norway's wilderness nearly two centuries ago.\nAnd her guests, Botnehagen told me, will be all the better for it.\nHaukali 333 is based on the design of a husmannshus or smallholder's cabin. Scattered all over rural Norway, these would have been homes for tenant farmers in the mid-19th Century, who worked on land owned by wealthy landowners and laboured long, gruelling hours to make ends meet. First glamourised by Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen in the late 1800s, in recent decades the husmannshus has became linked with nostalgia for a rural life lost as modern Norwegians increasingly moved to urban areas and a fixation with refurbishing and reinstating them began.\nCabin culture is on a high in Norway with almost 450,000 cabins and holiday homes existing in the country in 2023, according to Statistics Norway – an increase of more than 8% since 2013. These are used year-round by those who crave an escape in nature, with many kitted out to luxurious standards despite a rustic exterior. But Haukali 333 is unique in faithfully recreating the 19th-Century way of life in order to draw attention to a more sustainable way of living.\nIt did not necessarily sound like a premise for a relaxing holiday.\n\"No one is saying that life then was all good,\" Botnehagen smiled. \"But nor was it all bad. We want to show it how it really was, as much as possible. We think the people who come will discover something as a result.\"\nWhen I arrived, the wood-built cabin appeared delightfully rustic, with a turf roof, sky-blue door and window trimmings, sheep grazing its lawn and expansive views out over a mountain-backed lake with just one or two other houses within sight.\nThe mostly candlelit interior had a huge open stone oven, known in 19th-Century Norway as a grue, used as both a cooking and heating source. The wooden seating was pretty to look at, but hard, high-backed and challenging to relax upon. The outdoor shower sprayed water as cool as the spring that supplied it (or I had the option to fill an antique outdoortub with a bucket and wait for the Scandinavian sun to warm it, if I preferred).\nThe beds, accessed by a ladder, were built into the walls head-to-foot as they would have been in the mid-1800s for warmth and covered in fleeces from the Botnehagen family sheep. There was no TV, but 19th-Century evening entertainment in the form of a rokk or spinning wheel for spinning wool into clothes.\nBotnehagen told me I could pick fruit and vegetables (strawberries in July, potatoes in August) from the garden or nearby field, or row a boat out onto the lake with a rod to catch my own dinner. There was also the option to don 19th-Century labourers' garments: only one set, because back then, that would likely have been all a farmer owned.\nThere were a couple of modern-day concessions to comply with health and safety requirements – a toilet and electricity for powering the old kerosene lamp – but visitors looking around from almost any point inside or outside the cabin would see a view akin to that of a mid-19th-Century farm worker.\nMany of Botnehagen's guests appreciate the quirks of living a \"slow life like 1850\", as Haukali 333 describes itself.  \n\"I see it all the time: a fascination with this simple life,\" she said. \"A couple from London last winter just sat outside open-mouthed looking at the brilliance of the stars: light pollution where they live meant they seldom saw them. The children of one family this summer were crying when they left because they knew the chickens by name. A Danish family comes because they spend time together in a way they find impossible back home: picking berries, chopping firewood, hiking without anyone else in sight.\nOccasionally we have someone who needs to leave early because they cannot deal with the sound of silence or the basic facilities, but not often. There is five-star luxury and there is this different sort of luxury, where you are appreciating simpler things like the closeness of nature without all these ways we have invented of synthesising it.\"\nBotnehagen hit upon the idea for Haukali 333 in 2014 after inheriting the farm from her grandparents. She and her husband were preparing land for pasture when they uncovered old stones from the former smallholding.\n\"I remember feeling sad,\" she confided. \"The house and those who lived in it had become forgotten.

Haukali 333 opened to guests in 2018.\nWhat Botnehagen discovered was that reconstructing a snapshot of 1850s living was about more than realising her own idea or creating novelty accommodation. The era had many lessons to impart on how we can live life in a better and more environmentally friendly way. When she began building Haukali 333, it was important to her to communicate this to prospective guests.\n\"Now, as then, the lake provides us with fish, the soil gives us fruit and vegetables, our sheep wool,\" she explained. \"We have our own water supply.

I remember regularly travelling by horse as a girl, loaded up with eggs to take to town and exchange for whatever our family required. In our case it was usually flour.\"\nToday, food wastage is a huge issue, with the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimating that 14% of global food is wasted between harvest and retail. For Botnehagen, the advantages of commodity-based trade, widely practiced in the 1850s, were clear.\n\"There was greater efficiency in many ways,\" she said. \"There were less intermediaries: if you wanted something done you did it yourself. Most of it could be done within sight of your house. A husmannshus would be sized similarly to this one – 38sq m – but might accommodate six, seven, eight residents. That is one lot of timber to fell for the cabin, one fire keeping everyone warm.

But in sunny Valencia, the birthplace of the beloved recipe, controversy abounds as to what paella actually is.\nBordered by the Mediterranean and surrounded by farmlands, the coastal city of Valencia teems with excellent produce. It's in the fertile Albufera, a nature park 10km from the city, where Valencian farmers are believed to have first added rice to whatever humble ingredients were at hand, then cooked them in a single shallow paella (pan), giving the dish its name. For most Valencians today, one true paella Valenciana exists, while other rice dishes are considered \"rice with things\".\nWe asked Michelin-starred chef Ricard Camarena, a Valencia Community native whose parents and grandmother taught him to cook paella when he was just a boy, what \"real\" paella Valenciana is, and where to get it.\n\"Paella valenciana is a pretty specific recipe,\" says Camarena. \"It should never contain fish; it includes meat and vegetables… The most traditional version includes chicken, rabbit, sometimes snails, flat green beans, garrofó [white] beans, garlic, paprika, saffron and tomato.\"\nNo seafood – really? Well, not technically; while paella shouldn't contain fish, it can have other kinds of seafood. Arroz del señoret, a revered and popular Valencian rice dish with peeled seafood like shrimp and mussels is actually what most die-hard Valencians call seafood paella, whereas the rest of Spain calls seafood with rice \"paella de marisco\". Camarena admits: \"I'm not a purist. To me, seafood paella can be called that because it's cooked in a paella.\"\nBut Camarena doesn't serve any kind of paella at the five restaurants he helms in Valencia: \"Since everyone here has such reverence for paella and we've all had excellent ones, I try to avoid making dishes with traditional references.\"\nHere is where Camarena eats \"real\" paella Valenciana in Valencia.\nOriginally a beach shack that served as a changing room for occasional bathers, Casa Carmela has been managed by the same family since it was founded in 1922. Four generations later, this seaside restaurant now has Toni Novo at the helm, who continues to prepare paella Valenciana the way his great-grandmother Carmen once did.\n\"I would recommend Casa Carmela for a traditional paella Valenciana cooked over a wood fire,\" says Camarena. The arrocería (a restaurant specialising in paella and other rice dishes) uses orange wood to cook its paellas and has an open kitchen for patrons to watch as several paellas cook simultaneously over the fire. \"It's a pretty orthodox paella, sticking to a very traditional and straightforward approach – authentic and much like the kind you’d find in a private home, made with a similar method,\" says Camarena. \"It has that authentic, rustic and robust feel to it.\"\nAveraging about 25 wood-fired paellas per service, the paellas at Casa Carmela are always set in the middle of the table for diners to share and served with a wooden spoon – the traditional way of enjoying the dish.\nWebsite: https://www.casa-carmela.comAddress: C/ d'Isabel de Villena, 155, Poblats Marítims, 46011 València, ValenciaPhone: +34 963 71 00 73Instagram: @casacarmelarestaurant\nRafael Vidal, Levante's owner and chef, has been offering masterclasses in paella since around 2009 at its first location, which is outside the city. And besides teaching locals and visitors how to make paella, Vidal has had some high-profile students. \"Levante has always championed paella as their signature dish,\" says Camarena. \"In fact, he mentored [Spanish celebrity chef] José Andrés and collaborated with him on his paella projects in Las Vegas, assisting him throughout. Levante is definitely a must-visit.\"\nA second location of Levante opened in 2011 within the city, but moved to a larger location near Valencia's zoo, the Bioparc, in 2019. \"They make an excellent paella Valenciana; for me, a paella needs to be a couple of centimetres thick to have all the layers of texture,\" says Camarena.\nWebsite: https://www.restaurantelevante.comAddress: Av. de Manuel de Falla, 12, Campanar, 46015 València, ValenciaPhone: +34 960 65 11 52Instagram: @restaurantelevante\nHolding a Michelin Bib Gourmand, Napicol is found on Valencia's city outskirts. \"[It's] just 10 minutes from Valencia, right in the middle of La Huerta [the countryside] and it's incredibly beautiful,\" says Camarena. The drive there allows visitors to see where Valencia's produce is grown, getting a peek at the Valencian Community's rural areas.\nOwner and chef Anselmo Rausell sources many of his ingredients from the organic orchard next to the restaurant. While he serves up traditional paella Valenciana, he adds snails to the dish, an ingredient that Camarena considers optional in the original recipe. \"Finding snails in your paella is very traditional, but not that common [nowadays],\" he says. \"A lot of people either don’t like them or feel a bit squeamish about it. However, in a setting like Napicol, I think people are more open to encountering those snails.\"\n\"It's challenging to understand how each ingredient contributes flavour to the paella; it's the combination of everything that creates layers of complexity. For me, the snail adds another layer of depth to the flavours in the paella,\" he adds.\nDuring the summer, Napicol hosts \"Summer Nights\" on Saturdays, where patrons can enjoy live music on an outdoor stage on the patio while having dinner. \"I’d say that enjoying a paella right in the heart of the Valencian countryside at Napicol adds an almost religious significance to the experience,\" says Camarena.\nWebsite: https://www.napicol.comAddress: Carrer de Sant Isidre, 28, 46133 Alqueria de Roca, ValenciaPhone: +34 961 11 91 10Instagram: @restaurantenapicol\nGoya's first iteration was as a classic Spanish neighbourhood bar when it opened in 1950 in the La Gran Via neighbourhood. Serving typical bar food like bocadillos (sandwiches) and tapas, it attracted big screen names like director Bernardo Bertolucci before eventually closing in 2010. It got a facelift and reopened in 2015 as Goya Gallery, becoming known for its signature rice dishes.\n\"Goya Gallery, located in the centre of Valencia, is another great spot for paella,\" says Camarena. \"Fernando [Navarro] excels at making rice dishes, including paella. His natural talent for cooking is evident in his paella, which is balanced, refined and very well-crafted.\" When asked what a balanced paella Valenciana looks like, Camarena says, \"If a paella doesn't have the right amount of oil, it will be bland and risk burning. If it's too oily, it becomes hard to digest. It's crucial that none of the ingredients overpower the others. If any ingredient stands out, it means the paella isn't balanced. Too much paprika can quickly become overwhelming, as can too much saffron.\"\nWebsite: https://goyagalleryrestaurant.comAddress: Carrer de Borriana, 3, L'Eixample, 46005 València, ValenciaPhone: +34 963 04 18 35Instagram: @goyagalleryrestaurant\nOpened in 2019, Vernetta is a relative newcomer to the Valencian arrocerías scene. With a facade resembling a flower shop more than a restaurant, patrons soon learn why Vernetta's tagline is \"Mercado de las Flores\" (Flower Market).\nDespite Vernetta's recent entry into the scene, its chef has a long trajectory of cooking paella. \"Vernetta also makes excellent rice dishes,\" says Camarena. \"This guy [Pablo García Vernetta] really nails the paella.\"\nOne of the standout features of Vernetta's paella is the perfectly achieved socarrat – paella's crispy bottom layer that's beloved by all Valencians. \"Understanding that socarrat is an important part of paella. At Vernetta, they've managed to achieve it nicely – without overusing oil, but with a very even consistency. Socarrat forms when the rice sticks to the bottom of the paella pan, becoming golden and caramelised, creating a crispy layer. This happens because it has the right amount of oil,\" Camarena explains.\nVernetta's paella Valenciana is fragranced by rosemary, \"The final touch of rosemary is quite common, but not everyone knows how to balance it. Here, it's perfectly measured,\" says Camarena.\nWebsite: https://vernettarestaurante.com Address: Carrer del Mestre Racional, 15, L'Eixample, 46005 València, ValenciaPhone: +34 961 95 61 79Instagram: @vernetta_restaurante\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Here are his top picks in his hometown, from Goya Gallery to Napicol.\nOutside Spain, paella – a delicious, saffron-hued mélange of rice, vegetables and meat – is unquestionably the nation's most widely recognised dish. But in sunny Valencia, the birthplace of the beloved recipe, controversy abounds as to what paella actually is.\nBordered by the Mediterranean and surrounded by farmlands, the coastal city of Valencia teems with excellent produce. It's in the fertile Albufera, a nature park 10km from the city, where Valencian farmers are believed to have first added rice to whatever humble ingredients were at hand, then cooked them in a single shallow paella (pan), giving the dish its name. For most Valencians today, one true paella Valenciana exists, while other rice dishes are considered \"rice with things\".\nWe asked Michelin-starred chef Ricard Camarena, a Valencia Community native whose parents and grandmother taught him to cook paella when he was just a boy, what \"real\" paella Valenciana is, and where to get it.\n\"Paella valenciana is a pretty specific recipe,\" says Camarena. \"It should never contain fish; it includes meat and vegetables… The most traditional version includes chicken, rabbit, sometimes snails, flat green beans, garrofó [white] beans, garlic, paprika, saffron and tomato.\"\nNo seafood – really? Well, not technically; while paella shouldn't contain fish, it can have other kinds of seafood. Arroz del señoret, a revered and popular Valencian rice dish with peeled seafood like shrimp and mussels is actually what most die-hard Valencians call seafood paella, whereas the rest of Spain calls seafood with rice \"paella de marisco\".

{"id": 442, "question": "What is the name of the famous convict colony in Tasmania?", "answer": ["Port Arthur"], "doc": ["What follows is a brief and contestable account of Australia in the era of Transportation. There were two major convict colonies: New South Wales (1788-1840) and Van Diemen’s Land (later Tasmania, 1803-1853).", "This cove is about half a mile in length and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance. In honour of Lord Sydney, the Governor distinguished it by the name of Sydney Cove.[16] There they established the first permanent European colony on the Australian continent, within New South Wales, on 26 January 1788.", "From Tasmania to Vietnam, the world is filled with astounding rock formations for intrepid climbers. Here, Australian climber and photographer Simon Carter picks five of the best.\nMaybe it was Tom Cruise clambering up the red rock of Utah's Dead Horse Point in Mission: Impossible II that made people want to test their mettle, or the Oscar-winning film Free Solo that documented Alex Honnold's inspirational ascent of the 3,000ft-high rock face of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park without ropes or safety gear. Whatever the reason, climbing has boomed in popularity around the world. \n\"I've seen so many people getting into outdoor climbing over the last 20 years,\" says Australian climber and photographer Simon Carter. \"A lot of that's down to films, and to the proliferation of indoor climbing gyms, as well as sport climbing finally making it into the Olympics in 2020 in Japan.\"\nFrom Madagascar to China, the world is filled with towers, cliffs, caves and other astounding formations for intrepid souls who want to see what they're made of, whether they're sport climbing, bouldering, top-roping or free soloing. Many of the greatest climbing locations are gathered in Carter's new book The Art of Climbing. \"The physical and mental challenge of climbing\" was what first attracted Carter, who's been climbing for 40 years. \"But as I got more into it, it was about the places I was exploring and the people I was hanging out with. What I love about climbing is you get to experience random places on the planet, which are so interesting – it gives you a slice of a place you'd rarely explore as a tourist. The connection to nature is one of the most powerful things. You spend long periods of time in the most spectacular locations. You end up awed and fascinated by these places.\"\nHere are five of Carter's favourite climbing locations around the world to push your limits or just enjoy the sheer beauty of wild, rugged nature.\nFor an edge-of-the-world feel, few places can match the Tasman Peninsula in south-east Tasmania, Australia. The peninsula's known for Port Arthur, a famous convict colony from the 1800s when Australia was first settled by Europeans. But for climbers, it's the rugged coastline's giant sea columns of Jurassic dolerite, protruding up to 300m from the sea, that call to them. \nAbout an hour's drive from Hobart, Tasmania's capital, the Tasman Peninsula is home to a famous \"trilogy\" of iconic pillars. \"The Totem Pole, The Moai and Pole Dancer [pictured above] are adventurous outings for experienced climbers only,\" explains Carter. \"They all require at least two hours of hiking and an abseil to get to the pillars. The Moai (22m) is a moderately adventurous outing. In the case of Pole Dancer, it is a full-on adventure that takes at least five hours of hiking, two abseils and several pitches of climbing just to reach the start of Pole Dancer (40m) itself.\nThe Totem Pole, 65m metres high in total and only about 4m wide at the base, is quite a technically challenging rock climb for harder rock climbers. \"It's like a big matchstick – an incredible thing jutting out of the ocean. This is technical climbing in the most mind-blowing location you can imagine.\"\nTasmania can be reached with direct flights from Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane to Hobart and Launceston, or by the Spirit of Tasmania car ferry, which crosses between Geelong on mainland Australia to Devonport – having your own vehicle makes it easier to reach the island's remote parts.\nCrete, Corfu, Santorini, Mykonos… some of the names of the 6,000 Greek Islands are incredibly well-known to holidaymakers. Kalymnos, between the islands of Kos and Leros in the Dodecanese chain, is far less famous, but among climbers, it's legendary. \"Kalymnos could not be more famous amongst climbers,\" Carter says. \"It's a rocky island and it's not aesthetically the most beautiful Greek island. But for climbers it's a paradise, with cliffs and crags and caves all over it. It's probably the most popular single rock-climbing destination in the world right now. There must be well over 4,000 individual climbs on the limestone crags scattered all over Kalymnos and the neighbouring Telendos Island. The range of difficulty covers every grade, from easiest climbs to incredibly difficult – there really is something for everyone.\"\nTravellers can take a direct flight from Athens to Kalymnos or catch ferries from other islands, such as Rhodes. Among the most remarkable and challenging climbing experiences is Crystal Cave (pictured above) on Telendos, reachable via a 30-minute ferry or water taxi from Kalymnos and then a 1.5km hike (or ask the boat to drop you closer to Crystal Cave, which they're often happy to do). \"Crystal Cave is a long, hard, technical endurance climb – a very physical, gymnastic route,\" Carter adds. \"You need a 100m rope to do it because the cave is so high; when you get to the top of the cave, you need enough rope to lower off and get back to the ground. It's an extraordinary place.\"\nSmith Rocks State Park in Oregon is widely recognised as the birthplace of modern American sport climbing. Carter explains that climbing started becoming popular here in the 1960s and 1970s, then really took off in the '80s, when climbers looking for harder challenges turned their attention to the blank-looking walls. \n\"The steep clean walls had no cracks or features, so climbers started equipping the routes with permanently fixed safety bolts, which enabled climbers to concentrate on pushing the physical, gymnastic side of climbing, which became known as 'sport climbing' and took off around the country,\" he says.\nReached via a 200-mile drive from Portland, Smith Rock State Park is located in central Oregon's high desert. \"Smith Rocks is an awe-inspiring place,\" says Carter. \"The state park has the Crooked River running through it. It's a little oasis in the middle of the countryside. You have ranches and farmland, and then, boom, this state park pops up out of nowhere with these cool orange welded tuff rock formations for climbing, including The Smith Rock Group (in the background of the photo above), The Christian Brothers, The Dihedrals, Aggro Gully and the Monkey Face. The area has a Wild West feel to me. It's a place where you really feel you should be getting around on a horse. It has a slightly desolate feel, with these confronting walls of blankness.\" \nMore that 2,000 routes line the park's rocky landscapes. Most visitors go for one of the many easy or moderate routes, but hardcore climbers might attempt time-tested classics, such as To Bolt Or Not To Be, which is \"a stunning, blank-looking 41m-high wall in the Dihedrals area\", according to Carter. \"It requires consistent, hard climbing. When it was first climbed by French climber Jean Baptiste Tribout in 1986, it was the hardest route in North America. The cheeky name he gave the route made a point – soon after, sport climbing took off in the US. Years later, the route remains a coveted test-piece for top climbers today.\"\nThere's a whole lot of limestone with abundant climbing opportunities along France's south coast, but Calanques National Park, outside Marseilles, is the epicentre that draws in adventurers from around the world. \"The Calanques is a very historically significant area for rock climbers. French mountaineers in the early 1900s would go there when the weather was bad in the mountains to hone their technical skills, so there are amazing traditional rock climbs, like Arête de Marseille, a classic, easy route for experienced climbers on La Grande Candelle formation overlooking the Mediterranean, which was first climbed in 1927, as well as more modern climbing.\"\nMore like this:• Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms• The UK's five most beautiful national parks• The hidden wonders of Mexico's sacred underwater world\nThere are 26 calanques (or, roughly, \"rocky inlets\") in the national park, a 520-sq-km area that's popular with hikers, boaters, yachters, swimmers and nature lovers, as well as climbers. Marseille makes a good base, a 30-minute bus or car journey from the national park, or climbers can stay in one of the little port towns, such as Les Goudes. \"Climbers can choose from some of the long, old traditional climbs, or hard modern sport climbs on overhangs and caves,\" says Carter. \"The climbing is easy-to-moderate, with some harder stuff. There's something for everyone. The limestone here is so beautiful. Some of the climbs start from little beaches. What's also special about the Calanques is that you're climbing above the lovely sparkling Mediterranean ocean.\"\nThere's a sedate pace to the junk boat cruises that carry travellers around Hạ Long Bay, a gorgeous area in north-east Vietnam with more than 2,000 limestone karsts soaring out of the ocean, some as high as 400m. But the Unesco World Heritage Site is also an adventure playground, with fantastic opportunities for sea kayaking, scuba diving, hiking and rock climbing. \"Hạ Long Bay is a crazily beautiful place,\" says Carter. \"When you cruise around the area, you're transfixed by what you're seeing. It's one of those places where you feel you've really travelled somewhere unique and adventurous.\"\nCát Bà, the largest island in the bay, is the main hub for climbers, with the rugged mountains of Cát Bà National Park and the popular cliff Butterfly Wall. But to really experience the best of the Bay, you need to explore by boat. \"Although many of the karsts are too sharp, low-angled and vegetated to be of interest to most modern rock climbers, there are specks of gold for adventurous explorers,\" says Carter. \"You could get lost in this area, exploring for days by boat.\"\nThe Bay's climbs are not ideal for novices. \"You can't get a lot done as a beginner there – it's for adventurous, experienced climbers,\" Carter says. He picks out The Face and Turtle Cave as two favourite climbs within easy reach of Cát Bà. \"The Face is a huge wall of limestone, which looks like candlewax has dripped down the rock face. To climb it is an unusual experience. There are also plenty of climbs in the area where, once you've finished, you can abseil back down to a beach. But the greatest benefit of the area comes with the 'deep-water soloing' challenges, where you can just step off the boat and climb without a rope – just you, the rock and the ocean as your 'crash pad'.\" Turtle Cave is a perfect example of that, where climbers aim to climb to the lip of a cave 10m above the ocean – without using a rope.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

But for climbers, it's the rugged coastline's giant sea columns of Jurassic dolerite, protruding up to 300m from the sea, that call to them. \nAbout an hour's drive from Hobart, Tasmania's capital, the Tasman Peninsula is home to a famous \"trilogy\" of iconic pillars. \"The Totem Pole, The Moai and Pole Dancer [pictured above] are adventurous outings for experienced climbers only,\" explains Carter. \"They all require at least two hours of hiking and an abseil to get to the pillars. The Moai (22m) is a moderately adventurous outing. In the case of Pole Dancer, it is a full-on adventure that takes at least five hours of hiking, two abseils and several pitches of climbing just to reach the start of Pole Dancer (40m) itself.\nThe Totem Pole, 65m metres high in total and only about 4m wide at the base, is quite a technically challenging rock climb for harder rock climbers. \"It's like a big matchstick – an incredible thing jutting out of the ocean. This is technical climbing in the most mind-blowing location you can imagine.\"\nTasmania can be reached with direct flights from Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane to Hobart and Launceston, or by the Spirit of Tasmania car ferry, which crosses between Geelong on mainland Australia to Devonport – having your own vehicle makes it easier to reach the island's remote parts.\nCrete, Corfu, Santorini, Mykonos… some of the names of the 6,000 Greek Islands are incredibly well-known to holidaymakers. Kalymnos, between the islands of Kos and Leros in the Dodecanese chain, is far less famous, but among climbers, it's legendary. \"Kalymnos could not be more famous amongst climbers,\" Carter says. \"It's a rocky island and it's not aesthetically the most beautiful Greek island. But for climbers it's a paradise, with cliffs and crags and caves all over it. It's probably the most popular single rock-climbing destination in the world right now. There must be well over 4,000 individual climbs on the limestone crags scattered all over Kalymnos and the neighbouring Telendos Island. The range of difficulty covers every grade, from easiest climbs to incredibly difficult – there really is something for everyone.\"\nTravellers can take a direct flight from Athens to Kalymnos or catch ferries from other islands, such as Rhodes. Among the most remarkable and challenging climbing experiences is Crystal Cave (pictured above) on Telendos, reachable via a 30-minute ferry or water taxi from Kalymnos and then a 1.5km hike (or ask the boat to drop you closer to Crystal Cave, which they're often happy to do). \"Crystal Cave is a long, hard, technical endurance climb – a very physical, gymnastic route,\" Carter adds. \"You need a 100m rope to do it because the cave is so high; when you get to the top of the cave, you need enough rope to lower off and get back to the ground. It's an extraordinary place.\"\nSmith Rocks State Park in Oregon is widely recognised as the birthplace of modern American sport climbing. Carter explains that climbing started becoming popular here in the 1960s and 1970s, then really took off in the '80s, when climbers looking for harder challenges turned their attention to the blank-looking walls. \n\"The steep clean walls had no cracks or features, so climbers started equipping the routes with permanently fixed safety bolts, which enabled climbers to concentrate on pushing the physical, gymnastic side of climbing, which became known as 'sport climbing' and took off around the country,\" he says.\nReached via a 200-mile drive from Portland, Smith Rock State Park is located in central Oregon's high desert. \"Smith Rocks is an awe-inspiring place,\" says Carter. \"The state park has the Crooked River running through it. It's a little oasis in the middle of the countryside. You have ranches and farmland, and then, boom, this state park pops up out of nowhere with these cool orange welded tuff rock formations for climbing, including The Smith Rock Group (in the background of the photo above), The Christian Brothers, The Dihedrals, Aggro Gully and the Monkey Face. The area has a Wild West feel to me. It's a place where you really feel you should be getting around on a horse. It has a slightly desolate feel, with these confronting walls of blankness.\" \nMore that 2,000 routes line the park's rocky landscapes. Most visitors go for one of the many easy or moderate routes, but hardcore climbers might attempt time-tested classics, such as To Bolt Or Not To Be, which is \"a stunning, blank-looking 41m-high wall in the Dihedrals area\", according to Carter. \"It requires consistent, hard climbing. When it was first climbed by French climber Jean Baptiste Tribout in 1986, it was the hardest route in North America. The cheeky name he gave the route made a point – soon after, sport climbing took off in the US. Years later, the route remains a coveted test-piece for top climbers today.\"\nThere's a whole lot of limestone with abundant climbing opportunities along France's south coast, but Calanques National Park, outside Marseilles, is the epicentre that draws in adventurers from around the world. \"The Calanques is a very historically significant area for rock climbers. French mountaineers in the early 1900s would go there when the weather was bad in the mountains to hone their technical skills, so there are amazing traditional rock climbs, like Arête de Marseille, a classic, easy route for experienced climbers on La Grande Candelle formation overlooking the Mediterranean, which was first climbed in 1927, as well as more modern climbing.\"\nMore like this:• Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms• The UK's five most beautiful national parks• The hidden wonders of Mexico's sacred underwater world\nThere are 26 calanques (or, roughly, \"rocky inlets\") in the national park, a 520-sq-km area that's popular with hikers, boaters, yachters, swimmers and nature lovers, as well as climbers. Marseille makes a good base, a 30-minute bus or car journey from the national park, or climbers can stay in one of the little port towns, such as Les Goudes. \"Climbers can choose from some of the long, old traditional climbs, or hard modern sport climbs on overhangs and caves,\" says Carter. \"The climbing is easy-to-moderate, with some harder stuff. There's something for everyone. The limestone here is so beautiful. Some of the climbs start from little beaches. What's also special about the Calanques is that you're climbing above the lovely sparkling Mediterranean ocean.\"\nThere's a sedate pace to the junk boat cruises that carry travellers around Hạ Long Bay, a gorgeous area in north-east Vietnam with more than 2,000 limestone karsts soaring out of the ocean, some as high as 400m. But the Unesco World Heritage Site is also an adventure playground, with fantastic opportunities for sea kayaking, scuba diving, hiking and rock climbing. \"Hạ Long Bay is a crazily beautiful place,\" says Carter. \"When you cruise around the area, you're transfixed by what you're seeing. It's one of those places where you feel you've really travelled somewhere unique and adventurous.\"\nCát Bà, the largest island in the bay, is the main hub for climbers, with the rugged mountains of Cát Bà National Park and the popular cliff Butterfly Wall. But to really experience the best of the Bay, you need to explore by boat. \"Although many of the karsts are too sharp, low-angled and vegetated to be of interest to most modern rock climbers, there are specks of gold for adventurous explorers,\" says Carter. \"You could get lost in this area, exploring for days by boat.\"\nThe Bay's climbs are not ideal for novices. \"You can't get a lot done as a beginner there – it's for adventurous, experienced climbers,\" Carter says. He picks out The Face and Turtle Cave as two favourite climbs within easy reach of Cát Bà. \"The Face is a huge wall of limestone, which looks like candlewax has dripped down the rock face. To climb it is an unusual experience. There are also plenty of climbs in the area where, once you've finished, you can abseil back down to a beach. But the greatest benefit of the area comes with the 'deep-water soloing' challenges, where you can just step off the boat and climb without a rope – just you, the rock and the ocean as your 'crash pad'.\" Turtle Cave is a perfect example of that, where climbers aim to climb to the lip of a cave 10m above the ocean – without using a rope.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains 70 miles north-east of Atlanta, the small city is home to the University of Georgia (UGA), the US's first state-chartered college established in 1785. UGA's football team, the Georgia Bulldogs, is a perennial, national championship-calibre powerhouse. What's more, Athens's homegrown heroes, the B-52s and REM, were as influential as any rock 'n' roll bands to meld post-punk, new wave and indie sounds during the last quarter of the 20th Century. That notoriety spawned a musical legacy that continues to attract aspiring artists today.\nBut many visitors are now discovering a new side of Athens, and this music-obsessed college town is quietly showing bigger US cities how a place can grow up while keeping its edge.\nI'm discovering it too: a year ago, I moved back to The Classic City where I went to college in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Back then the place brimmed with cramped and sweaty music halls, raucous house parties, gritty dive bars and cheap, late-night eats. Much of that edge remains, but the polished city I've returned to now also shimmers with a nuanced culinary scene, boutique hotels, cocktail lounges and the soon-to-open 8,500-person Akins Ford Arena, which will be christened with a concert by the B-52s this December. The arena will also host the local hockey team, the Rock Lobsters (named after the B-52s' first single) and is expected to draw some of the nation's biggest bands.\nWhat I quickly learned is that, like me, Athens has matured. A point underscored by a string of recent, very adult-sounding anniversaries. Last year was the 40th for REM's first album, Murmur. The B-52s' first album turned 45. The famed Georgia Theatre, where BB King, The Police and Wynton Marsalis have played, also turned 45 as a concert venue. And the countdown is on for the 50th anniversary of Wuxtry Records, ground zero for musicians since 1976 and where devotees find racks of vinyl dedicated to local legends like Pylon, Drive-by Truckers, Widespread Panic and of Montreal.\nAs such, Athens has also started catering to a more mature crowd. Travellers are increasingly attracted to its blend of homey-meets-urban, where people walk to the post office and wave to their neighbours, but still demand great restaurants and the chance to squeeze into those sweaty music halls nightly. Recent tourism numbers bear out this attraction. Travel here is surging, with visitor-spending up more than 30% since the city's pre-pandemic crest in 2019.\n\"I'm not sure why there's been an uptick in folks 'discovering' Athens recently, but I have a few educated guesses,\" says Janet Geddis, the owner of the zealously indie Avid Bookshop. \"Athens feels like a small town, yet is marked by creativity and social activism that are more often associated with large cities. It's a rare combination that provides folks with comfort that comes from being known as well as the expansiveness that comes with exposure to a creative vibe.\"\nAnd though some locals worry this new rendition of Athens comes at the cost of being \"discovered\" and the need to \"keep Athens weird\" (to paraphrase the counter-commodification battle cry of Austin, Texas, over the last 25 years), for other long-time residents, such evolution is both welcomed and no surprise.\n\"The fact that we were off the beaten path really allowed for unbridled creativity,\" Mike Mills, a founding member of REM, told me when asked about Athens's importance to the band's early days. Mills has been here since 1979, when he enrolled at UGA. \"But the cat's pretty much out of the bag as far as the things Athens has to offer … a lot of great things happen here.

The 40 Watt [which has hosted the likes of Patti Smith, Nirvana and Sonic Youth] is still its wonderful, iconic self.\"\nA big reason for Athens's emergence from UGA's shadow in recent years is because this 130,000-person Southern college town (which includes 40,000 students) has blossomed into a true gourmet destination.\nFive & Ten was among the first to change the culinary landscape here when it opened almost 25 years ago, in the Five Points neighbourhood. \"Modern Southern\" dishes like Frogmore stew (shrimp, andouille sausage and grilled pork tenderloin served with a grit cake and Georgia peach butter) have become Athens standards. \"Over the years, people left, came back and opened places that added new flavours,\" says Peter Dale, the restaurant's owner and chef and an Athens native. \"Somewhere along the way, Athens grew up.\"\nFive & Ten has since inspired a growing and eclectic smattering of new and nationally touted restaurants. Puma Yu's, which opened in 2022, serves Asian-inspired plates in a one-time denim factory in the repurposed Mill District. Seabear Oyster Bar, in the old Coca-Cola bottling plant on Prince Avenue, is where to go for just-shucked oysters, shrimp, crab and Tiki-inspired cocktails like the Snowbird: dark rum, amaretto, coconut, lime, pineapple and turbinado sugar. A few blocks away, Birdies sandwich shop and market (which opened in 2023) offers delectable high-end cheeses, olive oils and jams. And just this month, Top Chef contestant Kenny Nguyen opened Pretty Boy, where he serves the Vietnamese flavours of his childhood.\n\"Athens has a history of attracting really talented people,\" says Erin Wilson, an owner at The National restaurant, a downtown cornerstone featuring seasonal dishes like cucumber gazpacho, pan-roasted swordfish and Portuguese-style custard tarts. \"And people here support local businesses.\"\nThough Athens has topped college-party-town lists for decades with around 80 spots to imbibe stuffed into the compact downtown area, the question was always: where does one carouse after college?

Around the corner, Creature Comforts Brewery, opened in a former tyre store, attracts a growing number of craft connoisseurs.\nIn the last few years, the scene has also gone uptown, literally and figuratively. The Hidden Gem, which opened in December 2023 near the Boulevard neighbourhood, became an immediate favourite among townies.

{"id": 449, "question": "What significant event in 1998 helped transform tourism in Northern Ireland?", "answer": ["The Good Friday Agreement"], "doc": ["Northern Ireland’s newly established tourism offices promoted Belfast’s vibrant city life, spectacular rural landscapes, and local culture—“anything but the Troubles,” says Emily Mannheimer, a lecturer at the Erasmus School of History, Culture, and Communication in Rotterdam, Netherlands, who studies conflict tourism in Northern Ireland.", "Through tourism, Northern Ireland has taken the opportunity to reinvent itself—and work through its contentious past. Some tourists began to arrive in Northern Ireland even before the peace process concluded.", "” As tourism expanded, Northern Ireland began to grapple more robustly with Troubles tourism. Take the Ulster Museum in Belfast, for example. Its first foray into the conflict was in 2009 with an exhibit that even William Blair, the museum’s director of collections, says “was fairly uninspiring.", "“You do bring in some wee serious issues as you go along,” Doherty says of the otherwise lighthearted tour. Derry Girls is just the latest attraction in a tourism transformation that began 25 years ago with the Good Friday Agreement. Before that, the world primarily associated Northern Ireland with its conflict known colloquially as the Troubles.", "” To take advantage of growing interest in Ireland’s natural landscapes, tourism officials established in 2014 the 1,600-mile Wild Atlantic Way. Tracing the island’s western coast, the driving route rivals the likes of California’s Pacific Coast Highway. (Here are 9 must-see stops along California’s Pacific Coast Highway.", "Thirty years ago, tourism to Northern Ireland was almost non-existent. Now, the country's newfound sense of optimism is once again luring travellers to its shores.\nIt's a sunny Saturday evening in Derry, Northern Ireland, and Ebrington Square on the northern banks of the River Foyle is buzzing. Tourists enjoy a drink on the terrace of the newly opened Ebrington Hotel & Spa. A busker draws a crowd outside the Embankment Bar & Grill and drinkers at the Walled City Brewery overflow onto the pavement.  \nIt's a familiar enough scene, but what makes this unusual is the location. During the Troubles – the decades-long clash between Protestant loyalists to the UK and Catholic nationalists who wanted to be reunited with the Republic of Ireland – that affected Northern Ireland from the late 1960s until the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, Derry was on the frontline of conflict.\nLocated right on the border with the Republic of Ireland, the city suffered attacks and bombings carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and clashes with the British army, brought in to keep the peace. Ebrington Square itself was home to the British army barracks, an impenetrable fortress looming over a divided city. \nThe conflict cast a long shadow over the nation, and 30 years ago, tourism in Northern Ireland was almost non-existent. As the Troubles began to ease after the IRA declared a ceasefire in August 1994, a few intrepid travellers arrived to visit the \"sites\" they'd seen on the news. Belfast's now legendary Black Cab Tours give an indication of what these were: bomb sites, \"peace walls\" constructed to keep opposing sides apart and overtly political murals.\nNow, however, peace has truly taken centre stage, and Ebrington Square is a visible symbol of the results. Reached by the S-shaped Peace Bridge that snakes its way across the river from the foot of the old walled city (the path to peace is never straight), the former no-go area is now the place to go.\nAccording to Aeidin McCarter, Derry Council's Investment and Enterprise Development officer, tourist numbers to Derry have doubled in the past 10 years, with visitors drawn by the city's stunning location, fascinating history and burgeoning hospitality industry.\n\"Derry's been transformed over the past 25 years, and last year was our biggest ever year for visitors,\" says McCarter. \"People are still interested in the history of The Troubles, but they come here because it's a tourist destination like any other European city. Peace has brought about that transformation. There's a thriving food and drink scene, bombed buildings have been restored and opened to the public and you can now walk the length of the once heavily guarded city walls.\"\nFrom the top of those 17th-Century walls, there are fine views in all directions: along the river to the sea, across the city to the surrounding mountains of Donegal and down to the area known as \"the Bogside\". Built on land formed after the river silted up, this predominantly Catholic estate was at the epicentre of the Troubles. It was here on Bloody Sunday (30 January 1972) that British troops opened fire on civil rights protesters, killing 13 and injuring 14 others, one of whom later died.\nBetween 1969 and 1972, part of the Bogside was a self-declared autonomous Irish Nationalist area known as \"Free Derry\". The Museum of Free Derry, which opened in 2007 in Bogside, tells the uneasy history of this period. And in July 2024, the much-anticipated Peacemakers Museum opened nearby, telling the next chapter in the Derry story: how the conflict escalated to virtual civil war before the gradual onset of peace.\n\"It's divided into sections, which relate to key periods that form the backdrop to the Good Friday Agreement,\" said project manager Michael Cooper. \"As you walk around the museum, you move from Bloody Sunday to the present day and learn about the roles of local residents and politicians Martin McGuinness, Mitchel McLaughlin and John Hume in the peace process.\"\nJohn Hume, an Irish nationalist politician who worked tirelessly for a peaceful way forward, was awarded Nobel, Gandhi and Martin Luther King peace prizes for his efforts, the only person to receive all three awards, and visitors can see them displayed at the Guildhall Museum in the city centre.   \nMore like this:• The incredible reinvention of Ireland's 'awful' tourist town• The Irish city you should visit in 2024• Ireland's whipped cream and local berry treat \nBefore the Good Friday Agreement, Derry/Londonderry, depending on which side of the political divide you sit (nationalists favour using the name Derry, and unionists Londonderry), was peppered with military checkpoints. Now, you can come and go freely but their legacy remains. Northern Ireland's dramatic, littoral itinerary, the Causeway Coastal Route, begins just north of Belfast and stops in Derry; there's then a gap of 30 miles before the Republic's Wild Atlantic Way begins at Malin Head in County Donegal on the island's northernmost tip.\nIn 2020, the Irish Government launched a \"Shared Island Initiative\" to enhance cooperation between the two countries. One if its current projects is to link these two major coastal routes to create a continuous island driving route along the west coast, taking you through wild and rugged countryside dotted with enchanting villages and historic monuments. \nAnother initiative is the Narrow Water Bridge, a project that was officially launched in June 2024. Crossing sparkling Carlingford Lough at Warrenpoint, the site of one of the worst IRA bomb attacks in 1979, the bridge will join the two nations at the spot where President Joe Biden's ancestors set sail across the Atlantic. Scheduled to open in 2027, the bridge will allow visitors easy access between the Republic and Northern Ireland on the east coast and bring them, in just an hour's drive from Dublin or Belfast, to an area of spectacular natural beauty, taking in the Mourne and Cooley Mountains, the Ring of Gullion, thriving coastal resorts like Newcastle, and the Castlewellan Peace Maze. The latter's 6,000 yew trees, planted in 1998 to mark the Good Friday agreement, are now fully grown.\n\"These projects are physical manifestations of the optimism that has grown since Good Friday,\" said Tourism Ireland's Helen McGorman. \"[It's] a shift in emphasis away from the Troubles to the amazing scenery, the incredible cities and the island's much wider history.\"  \nThe biggest of those projects was the launch of Titanic Belfast, a museum dedicated to the world's most famous cruise liner, housed in a behemoth of a building on the exact same spot in Belfast's docks where the Titanic was built. Since its 2012 opening, it has attracted eight million visitors and brings £70-80m into the economy each year.\n\"Titanic Belfast was a project that came off the back of the Good Friday agreement,\" said Judith Owens, the museum's CEO. \"Titanic was well-known and our job was to take that brand, bring it back to Northern Ireland and use that to catapult us into the global tourist industry.\" \nShe added: \"We get visitors from 142 different countries and once they are here they explore further afield, discovering our heritage and culture and a country with a very different identity to the one it had 30 years ago.\"\nThirty years ago, visitors to Northern Ireland were mainly journalists and anyone taking photographs did so with the aim of making the front page. But Martin McCrossan, a forward-thinking Derry local in a mixed Catholic/Protestant marriage with a keen interest in local history was one of the first to make a bid for tourists. \n\"In 1994, my father decided he was going to set up a tour guiding business,\" his daughter, Charlene, told me. Since her father passed away, she runs the company he founded, along with her mother and is one of its main guides, regularly taking visitors to the city walls, Derry's two cathedrals and sites made famous by the hugely popular TV series, Derry Girls.\n\"At the time, everyone thought he was completely mad, but he wanted to show people there was more to the city than the Troubles. I remember him telling me that one day there would be peace and, in its wake, tourists.\"\nFor evidence of that, you need look no further than the queue forming outside the newly opened Stich and Weave restaurant in Ebrington Square. Housed in the former army canteen, its name is a nod to the city's shirt-making history (at the turn of the last century, 80% of shirts worn in the British Empire were made in Derry). Behind the restaurant, on the edge of the square beside the water, work is underway on the new DNA (Derry North Atlantic) maritime museum, which will chart the city's history, illustrating how its position as the UK's westernmost port is woven into its DNA. Due to open in 2026, it will be the latest in a series of new visitor attractions that have sprung up since the Good Friday Agreement, and another symbol of the country's optimism. \nOne of Northern Ireland's greatest storytellers was Belfast-born CS Lewis, who drew inspiration for Narnia from the snow-covered Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland's south-eastern corner. On the gable of a building in Rostrevor, a charming Victorian town at the foot of those mountains, someone has painted an oft-cited Lewis quotation, one that unwittingly sums up the new Northern Irish ethos and the impact it has had on tourism: \"You can't go back and change the beginning but you can start where you are and change the ending.\" \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

But Mineral Wells, a small town that straddles Palo Pinto and Parker Counties in north Texas, has a very different claim to fame: in the 19th Century, it was renowned as one of the US’s \"greatest health resorts\"– and it's now once again on the rise as a wellness destination.\nThe small town – designated the official Wellness Capital of Texas  by state legislators in 2023 – has nine underground wells with impressive mineral content. The water, packed full of micronutrients like calcium, potassium, magnesium and lithium, is the only mineral water in Texas suitable for bathing as well as drinking. Visitors have long flocked here to sip and soak in the healing water that has some of the highest mineral content in the world and is renowned for its curative properties.\nBut when Mineral Wells was settled in the late 1800s, early residents had no idea of the bounty beneath their feet. Judge James Alvis Lynch, wife Armanda and their 10 children travelled from Dennison, Texas, to the Millsap Valley in the Palo Pinto Mountains in search of a drier climate to help the couple's rheumatism.\nHowever, they soon tired of walking four miles to retrieve water from a nearby river, and \"the first well in what would become Mineral Wells was dug on their 100-acre homestead in 1880\", said Rose Jordan, director of tourism at Visit Mineral Wells. The family thought the water tasted \"funny\" but started consuming it when it did no harm to their livestock.\nSoon, she said, the Lynches found relief from rheumatism, and the entire family reported better health. The water quickly became renowned for its health benefits, such as allegedly improving digestion and alleviating arthritis, with thousands of people travelling to Mineral Wells to find relief. Lynch started selling the water for $0.05 a cup (about $1.70 in today's time) – and soon had more customers than he could handle.\n\"Since our founding days, Mineral Wells has been built upon the most fundamental of elements – water,\" said Jordan. \"The mineral-rich water from our wells is healthful, healing and pure; it's liquid gold.\"\nThe thousands that came here to drink the water included Ed Dismuke, who had a life-threatening stomach disease. \"His health improved considerably, and in 1904 Dismuke went on to launch the Famous Mineral Water Company, bottling the water that had helped save his life,\" Jordan said.\nAs word spread, more and more people headed to Mineral Wells, and new wells were drilled to facilitate new bathhouses, drinking pavilions and spas. The arrival of trains in 1891 made the city even more popular and spread the water beyond north Texas; in 1900, more than 150,000 visitors flooded in from across the US to bathe and drink in the mineral pools and spas. Mineral Wells became so popular that over the years, what quickly became Texas's premier spa resort town welcomed luminaries like US President Dwight Eisenhower; Lyndon B Johnson (before he was president); and actors Clark Gable, Judy Garland, Roy Rogers, Marlene Dietrich and the Three Stooges.\n\"By 1909, Mineral Wells had seven wells and pavilions, four bathing houses, 46 hotels and boarding houses, and two sanitoriums. It was home to 21 mineral water companies by 1913,\" explained Carol Elder, who now owns Famous Mineral Water Company, which bottles Crazy Water, the only water company still in business in Mineral Wells.\nHowever, the Great Depression and the economic crisis that followed led to a slide in the popularity of mineral springs and wellness resorts. Focus, and travellers, shifted from Mineral Wells and most the town's water companies closed down by the end of the 1940s. The town's economy shifted to a reliance on the nearby military base, Fort Wolters.\nBut now, with increased interest in wellness, spas, fitness centres and retreats catering to a new generation of health-conscious individuals, Mineral Wells is aiming to be what it once was: the place \"where America drinks its way to health\" and a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a wellness getaway.\nMore like this:• Mindfulness retreats: The quiet travel solution to a noisy world• The surprising wellness trend based on beer• An ancient activity that could help ease anxiety \n\"The minerals in our water are naturally occurring; not added or created in some factory.

It has a water bar that serves all the varieties of Crazy Water, as well as Crazy popsicles and a Crazy Fizz Sorbetto Float, made with sorbetto and carbonated Crazy Water. And the landmark Baker Hotel & Spa, a 14-storey Spanish Colonial building, is scheduled to reopen in spring 2026 after a $76m renovation.

On 20-22 September, World Wellness Weekend, a range of activities that prioritise self-care and wellbeing are planned.\nAnd Crazy Wellness Retreats (immersive wellness weekends held every quarter) showcase local wellness activities, from meditation and mindfulness workshops to yoga and nutrition seminars and, of course, mineral water baths.\n\"A wellness-minded traveller now seeks opportunities to experience nature, and we are rich in those,\" Jordan says, citing the three state parks, four lakes, the only natural rock-climbing area in north Texas and more than 30 miles of hiking and biking trails. \"We are using our natural bounty – mineral water, lakes, rivers, parks and more – to build a healthful future for people.\"\nHowever, water continues to dominate the town's past and present. \"Mineral Wells grew on the properties of its waters and has once again brought health and wellness back into priority,\" Elder said.\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story contained an incorrect cost for the water.

It was home to 21 mineral water companies by 1913,\" explained Carol Elder, who now owns Famous Mineral Water Company, which bottles Crazy Water, the only water company still in business in Mineral Wells.\nHowever, the Great Depression and the economic crisis that followed led to a slide in the popularity of mineral springs and wellness resorts. Focus, and travellers, shifted from Mineral Wells and most the town's water companies closed down by the end of the 1940s. The town's economy shifted to a reliance on the nearby military base, Fort Wolters.\nBut now, with increased interest in wellness, spas, fitness centres and retreats catering to a new generation of health-conscious individuals, Mineral Wells is aiming to be what it once was: the place \"where America drinks its way to health\" and a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a wellness getaway.\nMore like this:• Mindfulness retreats: The quiet travel solution to a noisy world• The surprising wellness trend based on beer• An ancient activity that could help ease anxiety \n\"The minerals in our water are naturally occurring; not added or created in some factory. In a world where people are discovering that water can be as processed as cheese, they are looking for natural options,\" Elder said.\nAs part of the movement to reclaim this rich past, the Crazy Water Hotel, built in 1927 and a historic landmark, recently finished a $22m renovation, courtesy of 88 local investors, including Elder. It has a water bar that serves all the varieties of Crazy Water, as well as Crazy popsicles and a Crazy Fizz Sorbetto Float, made with sorbetto and carbonated Crazy Water. And the landmark Baker Hotel & Spa, a 14-storey Spanish Colonial building, is scheduled to reopen in spring 2026 after a $76m renovation. Both house spas offer mineral baths.  \nJordan, who says that while the town was \"built on the waters\" and \"continues to grow on those roots\", notes that Visit Mineral Wells has much else to offer the wellness-minded visitor, with excellent hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, hunting, fishing spots, kayaking and camping in the area.\nClark Gardens, a botanical garden spread over 35 acres, offers a range of events focused on wellness, the outdoors and the arts through the year. On 20-22 September, World Wellness Weekend, a range of activities that prioritise self-care and wellbeing are planned.\nAnd Crazy Wellness Retreats (immersive wellness weekends held every quarter) showcase local wellness activities, from meditation and mindfulness workshops to yoga and nutrition seminars and, of course, mineral water baths.\n\"A wellness-minded traveller now seeks opportunities to experience nature, and we are rich in those,\" Jordan says, citing the three state parks, four lakes, the only natural rock-climbing area in north Texas and more than 30 miles of hiking and biking trails. \"We are using our natural bounty – mineral water, lakes, rivers, parks and more – to build a healthful future for people.\"\nHowever, water continues to dominate the town's past and present. \"Mineral Wells grew on the properties of its waters and has once again brought health and wellness back into priority,\" Elder said.\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story contained an incorrect cost for the water. This has now been fixed. \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

The next event in 2026 will likely head back to Kyrgyzstan, where the inaugural event began in 2014. This year's competition concludes on Friday 13 September.", "The fifth World Nomad Games kicked off this week in Kazakhstan's capital of Astana. Dubbed the \"Great Gathering on the Steppe\", the Olympics of the nomadic world is a spectacular celebration of traditional sports, identity and culture from across inner Asia.\nPart Highland Games, part Mongolian Naadam festival, and featuring sports like horseback wrestling and Central Asian strongman competitions, the World Nomad Games give a flavour of what the Olympics might have looked like if Genghis Khan had been in charge.\nIndeed, many of the sports have their roots in the skills required to survive on the steppe and in the unrivalled equestrian abilities that fuelled a millennium-long wave of successive steppe empires, from the Huns to the Mongols. There are traditional events such as archery and long-distance horse races, but the Games also promote Kazakh food, traditional dress and even the art of epic storytelling. The goal is to preserve and protect nomadic and steppe culture, which is under increasing threat from globalisation, modernisation and even climate change.\nThe World Nomad Games take place every two years and shifts locations as frequently as the nomads it celebrates. The next event in 2026 will likely head back to Kyrgyzstan, where the inaugural event began in 2014. This year's competition concludes on Friday 13 September.\nThe opening ceremony on 8 September was a spectacular affair, with 3,000 athletes from 89 countries filing into the arena, as hundreds of musicians, dancers and singers performed in front of Central Asia's political elite. The show traced the history of the Kazakh steppe from ancient Scythian warriors and Silk Road merchants to the rise of the Golden Horde and the Kazakh khanate in the 15th Century. Performers depicted scenes of the steppe convening under the symbolic embroidered panels of a yurt (pictured above), a reference to the gatherings of nomadic confederations that occurred periodically to enthrone a new khagan (ruler).\nThis Games favourite – known variously across the region as kokpar, kok buru, ulak tartysh and buzkashi – is best described in English as rugby on horseback with a dead goat as a ball.\nTwo teams of seven horsemen compete to grab hold of the headless carcass (made of rubber for these games), hoist it under their leg, sprint for the opposition's line and then dump it in a ring of rope or a large plastic doughnut. Rough and tumble is putting it mildly; broken fingers and ripped ears are par for the course. \"The most important attribute for a kokpar player is to be strong, to be brave and to not be afraid,\" said the Kazakh team captain, Kermenbek Turganbek.\nOn Thursday, thousands of fans watched home team Kazakhstan beat arch rivals (and ethnic brothers) Kyrgyzstan in the final in extra time.\nHunting with eagles is one of the more unusual of the 21 official sports featured in the Games. It takes many years for an experienced eagle hunter (known as a berkutchi) to tame and train a wild golden eagle (berkut), and the expense and time required makes it the most endangered of the Games' traditional sports.\nThe event has three categories at the competition: hunting with eagles, hawks or falcons. All have their roots in Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and western Mongolia, where the hunting of foxes, rabbits and wolves traditionally takes place in winter when the animals' fur is thickest.\nWrestling on horseback (audaryspak) takes place in a 15m-diameter sandy arena and bouts are divided into six weight categories. The aim is to pull one's opponent onto the ground, but wrestlers can also get points for lifting their opponent from the saddle or pushing them out of the circle. Horses get penalised for biting.\nOther forms of non-horseback wrestling (known as kureshi, kurash or koresh in Turkic languages) include specific Kazakh, Turkish, Tatar and Kyrgyz styles, most of which also include female competitions, unlike many of the Games' sports.\nArchery (both ground and on horseback) is the sport that is perhaps most evocative of inner Asia's warrior past. For centuries waves of mounted archers overwhelmed cities across the Middle East and Eastern Europe, who were left helpless by the steppe people's unrivalled mastery of iron stirrups and composite bows.\n\"Chinggis [Genghis] Khan's blood is in my blood,\" said Mongolian archer Tsetsegsuren Dorjsuren. \"I feel my ancestors when I pick up my bow.\"\nMas-wrestling, sometimes known as stick tug of war, has its roots in Yakutiya (today's Sakha Republic, one of several Turkic republics in the Russian Federation, who attended the 2024 Games.\nAthletes sit facing each other with their feet on a board, both holding a wooden stick, or mas. The aim is to grab the stick from your opponent or pull your opponent over to your side (think: over-sized toddlers fighting over a toy). There are separate men's and women's competitions.\nThe World Nomad Games is about much more than simply sport. At the heart of the half-dozen sporting venues is the Ethno-aul (aul means village in Kazakh), a collection of yurts, craft shops and local restaurants where reenactors dress as medieval warriors and musicians and perform ancient folk songs.\nPicture above, these women in traditional Kazakh dress stand in front of an apple tree in reference to the city’s claim to be the ancestral home of the wild apple; Almaty's Soviet-era name Alma-Ata means \"Grandfather of Apples\".\nOne of the great joys of attending the World Nomad Games is the traditional music that pours out of the concert venues and yurts of the Ethno-aul complex. The most compelling Kazakh performers are its akim, bards or storytellers who recite and improvise epic poems and histories, while playing the dombra, a Kazakh-style lute.\nMore like this: - Qurt: A Kazakh \"cheese of resilience\" - A road trip through Kazakhstan's immense landscapes- The five best things to do in Turkistan\nThe musicians in the above photo are playing the dombra and accordion, the latter the legacy of the long Russian influence in the region.\nAlongside sport and music, the World Nomad Fames aim to preserve artistic and textile traditions through its hosting of master craftspeople, many of whom offer displays and classes in traditional Kazakh handcrafts.\nBulbul Kapkyzy, pictured here with her Soviet-era Lenin carpet, is a master weaver, yurt maker and ethnographer who has been perfecting and teaching for more than 45 years. An ethnic Kazakh born in western Mongolia, she moved to Kazakhstan 20 years ago after independence, during a time of huge ethnic and economic upheaval in post-Soviet Central Asia. \nAstana's ultra-modern architecture seems an unlikely location for a celebration of ancient nomadic culture.\nNomads have traditionally left little architectural legacy, and Kazakhstan's futuristic capital of Astana is quickly making up for lost time. Its well-funded, cutting-edge modern architectural projects by big names such as Norman Foster give it the feel of a Central Asian Dubai, even though its location on the great steppe means that it is the world's second coldest capital city (after Mongolia's Ulaanbaatar).\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Chefs use indigenous, borrowed and blended flavours, with enormous respect for homegrown ingredients, resulting in a refined cuisine that has a lightness of touch appropriate to the sun-drenched climate.\nFrom tranquil breakfasts through to romantic suppers, locals grab any opportunity to be in proximity to their beloved beaches and bays. And for travellers, these five restaurants offer not just a meal, but an opportunity to savour Sydney at its finest.\nReferring to Quay as \"world class\" barely describes the sum of its glorious parts. With unobstructed views over Sydney's Opera House and Harbour Bridge, this stunningly located restaurant is the perfect home for exquisite dishes that honour organic ingredients. \nExecutive chef Peter Gilmore's obsession with the life cycle of plants, from seed to stamen, is the first clue the diner is in for an exceptional experience. His artful, ethereal cuisine presents like tiny gardens of native vegetables, flowers and fronds, while luxurious rockpools of aquatic fascinations are exquisite in technique and execution. Quay's four-, six- or eight-course menus are served on hand-crafted vessels, and textures dance both on the plate and palate.\nIncredibly, there's no hint of the pomp or pretentiousness usually associated with such temples of culinary art; nary a white cloth on a sleek timber tabletop lest it masks the natural grain. An extensive and considered wine list is a melodious match for this culinary ode to the country's vast, bountiful land and ocean, where every dish is a standout.\nWebsite: https://www.quay.com.au/Phone number: 02 9251 5600Address: Upper Level, Overseas Passenger Terminal, The Rocks, Sydney 2000Instagram:@quayrestaurant\nWhile Sydney's glorious Northern Beaches are home to a slew of casual waterfront restaurants,  upmarket gems are rare. However, Ormeggio, located among the glistening yachts of D'Albora Marina, is absolutely one of them.\nIf you've ever been invited to a long lunch in Italy, you'll know that proceedings involve, at the very least, sincere and impeccable generosity alongside a sumptuous feast prepared with love and passion. Chef Alessandro Pavoni's contemporary Italian restaurant Ormeggio follows the playbook to a T – although the food and vista outshine even nonna's best efforts.\nYou'll swoon over a meat-free menu focussed on inventive share plates of sustainable seafood with fresh, bright flavours – think swordfish cotoletta (fried, crumbed cutlet) with fermented chilli mayonnaise and salsa verde, or yellowfin tuna crudo with textures of tomato, almonds and extra virgin olive oil. Seasonal house-churned gelato, such as Amalfi lemon with candied lemon and Italian meringue, is theatrically dispensed tableside and should not be missed. Linger over sunset Negronis and you're destined for a moonlit stroll. \nWebsite: https://www.ormeggio.com.au/Phone number: 02 9969 4088Address: D'Albora Marina The Spit, Spit Road Mosman 2088Instagram: @ormeggio\nPerched at the bow of Coogee Pavilion's beachfront collective of eateries and bars, Mimi's effortlessly delivers on style and substance. Despite its reputation for glamorous clientele, the dining space is incredibly relaxing. Grand Art Deco arched windows flood the elegant room with natural light, allowing in occasional lock-tussling breeze and salt-spray kisses along with a view spanning sun-baskers, rolling seafoam and Maroubra's ruggedly handsome coastline.\nBeing here is a mental mini-break that can easily distract from the menu, but focus is soon restored with good-humoured servers setting down cocktails alongside warm, house-made rye sourdough with kefir butter whilst reciting which share-specials are available as half serves.\nIt's evident, even midweek, that people swarm here to feel good about themselves while Mimi's does the heavy lifting. Whole lobster, salt-baked mud crab, truffles, caviar bumped with iced vodka and salted fior di latte soft serve – the food is spectacular yet nothing is overworked. The secret is in extraordinary ingredients beautifully prepared by confident chefs who know their beurre blanc from yuzu kosho, along with friendly service and sumptuous décor. Sure, your wallet's leaving lighter, but you'll be miles from care, leaving footprints in the sand.\nWebsite: https://merivale.com/venues/mimis/Phone number: 02 9114 7324Address: Coogee Pavilion, Middle Level, 130A Beach St, Coogee 2034Instagram: @merivale\nHistorically, Sydney's French bistro reservations only peak during winter, when it's finally cool enough to wear fine Merino-wool capes and over-imbibe vin rouge, but L'Héritage's fresh edge has joyfully unlatched such restrictive windows.\nLaunched during the Covid-19 pandemic, this lofty, elegantly laidback venue, situated within a heritage-listed, early 1900s Navy drill hall, has been smartly whitewashed and dressed in Paris-market curios, antiques and fresh flowers, exuding country-manor charm during daylight hours and an exceedingly romantic ambiance by evening. \nThe blissful turquoise surrounds of Chowder Bay are utterly mesmerising, yet the kitchen is where true alchemy resides. Chef Julien Audibert-Lebon's tasting menu demonstrates an intuitive grasp of the local palate, his approach to traditional French cuisine exercising restraint and butterfly-balance. Even on the balmiest Sydney day, his lobster and blue swimmer crab bisque with pastis and fennel sips like a tonic. A boeuf bourguignon presents as gelatinous beef-cheek discs layered with translucent potato pasta and veiled in jus brightly accented with mirepoix and herbs. Barramundi sauced a la Grenobloise (lemon, butter, capers, parsley) is as expressive as the 80% French wine list and a young sommelier's insightful pairings. Dessert follows suit with cloud-light mousse and sunny patisserie.\nWebsite: https://lheritage.com.au/Phone number: (02) 9968 1658Address: 7b Chowder Bay Road, Mosman 2088Instagram: @bistro.lheritage\nIt's safe to assume that when you operate a restaurant furled within the headsail of the city's most iconic building, the pressure to perform is significantly elevated. Fortunately, the Fink Group, who also own nearby Quay Restaurant, know a thing or nine about hospitality.\nIn keeping with its cultural surrounds, Bennelong invites patrons to an act in several parts, with architect Jorn Utzon's jaw-dropping 1970's design providing the amuse bouche. The dramatically tiered interior is swathed in ochre, brushed brass and stone with alternating sky-blue and indigo backdrops. Pitch-perfect cocktails, immaculate Australian wines and luxe bites, including pristine rock oysters with lemon-pepper granita, are garnished with awe-inspiring harbour views.\nPrivate dining zones in the wings overlook dress circle tables below, both offering elegant menus by executive chef Peter Gilmore and his trusted head chef Robert Cockerill. Utilising the same incredible produce as Quay, a less complex menu spotlights hero ingredients: premium Australian Wagyu paired with confit tomato and bearnaise or XO pippies with crisp aubergine and striped peanuts are both excellent illustrations. Finales include dreamy renditions of pavlova (passionfruit curd, meringue) and lamington (coconut ice cream, cherry jam, chocolate glaze). Cue applause. \nWebsite: https://www.bennelong.com.au/Phone number: 02 9240 8000Address: Sydney Opera House, Bennelong Point, Sydney 2000Instagram: @bennelong_sydney\n \nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}
{"id": 457, "question": "What is the name of the new international airport opening in Greenland’s capital?", "answer": ["Nuuk"], "doc": ["A new international airport will soon open in Greenland’s capital Nuuk, allowing larger aircraft to land for the first time - paving the way for direct flights from the US and Europe. It’s the first of three airport projects that officials hope will boost the local economy, by making the Arctic territory more accessible than ever before.", "Greenland’s new international airport opens in the capital of Nuuk on November 28, making the Arctic island more accessible than ever. But for the people of Greenland, it’s about more than adding global flight routes—it’s a signal that their historically isolated home is now officially open for tourism.", "Greenland is to open a new international airport in its capital, Nuuk, in November 2024. The island nation remains a less common destination for adventure travelers. Nevertheless, tourism is a “significant pillar of the country’s economy”, according to Greenland’s official website.", "Currently only small planes can take off and land at Nuuk Airport A new international airport will soon open in Greenland’s capital Nuuk, allowing larger aircraft to land for the first time - paving the way for direct flights from the US and Europe.", "Big changes are on the horizon for tourism in Greenland. The launch of Nuuk’s new international airport on November 28, 2024, marks the beginning of a series of openings for three Greenlandic airports through to 2026.", "Following this summer's heated protests against overtourism, there's some good news. For every overcrowded tourist spot in Europe, there are plenty of places around the world that need more visitors.\nSt Mark's Square in Venice might host more tourists than pigeons, Barcelona has seen aggression against tourists reach a fever pitch and the clifftop paths can in Italy's Cinque Terre can feel like a supermarket queue. However, beyond these (and other) hotspots lie places that are equally rich in culture but without the crowds. Around the world, there are cities crying out for tourists and walking trails where you won't see a soul all day.\nWhile we often hear about the destructive forces of tourism in major cultural destinations, for lesser-developed countries, the money tourism brings in helps to build much-needed infrastructure and community spaces. It offers jobs and training and gives locals a chance to proudly share their country's culture and traditions. Managed well, tourism can be an enriching economic stream, bringing people together around shared values and experiences. It doesn't have to replicate the issues we've seen this summer.\nThese four destinations are just a handful of the countries who are using tourism as a tool to build stronger economies, and welcoming travellers with open arms. \nWith a new international airport opening in the capital, Nuuk, later this year, plus another international landing strip coming in the northern tourist capital of Ilulissat in 2026, Greenland is getting ready to welcome an increasing number of visitors. It marks a turning point in Greenlandic tourism: to date, its international runways have not been long enough to handle large flights, instead routing travellers through Kangerlussuaq, a former US military base, and shuttling them on a smaller plane to onward destinations.\nThe new infrastructure will mean that not only can more tourists fly directly into the capital, but, perhaps more importantly in a country where much is imported, more goods can come in and larger quantities of its export products, including seafood, can go out, hopefully leading to an economic boost for the whole country. Tourism is one way to pay for the airport development as well as provide jobs and stability for the future.\nGreenland is focused on two main forms of tourism, the first being adventure tourism, which includes everything from rock climbing in Eastern Greenland to whale watching and camping on the Greenland Ice Sheet. The other is year-round tourism, which includes an emphasis on dark sky tourism – star gazing and northern lights-watching in particular.\nGetting tourists to experience Greenland in summer has been far easier than doing so in winter; but to enable local people to have year-round jobs, tourists need to come in the off season too. Attracting people to places where the sun barely shines in the peak of winter – and where temperatures can dip to -50C – might seem like a challenge, but the country has made a virtue of it, opening up sky view cabins and igloos for awe-filled aurora-focused experiences.\nTanny Por, head of international relations at Visit Greenland, is keen to emphasise that it's not a question of quantity over quality, noting that the country's goal is that 80% of the population sees tourism as something that offers a positive contribution to society. \"Airports cost a lot, so we do have to encourage a lot of tourists to come,\" she said, \"but we will be doing this in a balanced way, so as not to overrun local people.\"\nPor has just returned from a trip looking at travel opportunities in North Greenland, which will be accessible via direct international flights from 2026 when the new runway in Ilulissat opens.\n\"I went to a tiny town of 1,000 inhabitants, Qasigiannguit, and it was fantastic,\" she said. \"There are musk ox in the backcountry, historical reenactments at the local museum and so many whales! I heard them before I saw them from my bedroom, and they were everywhere we went.\"\nMorocco is another nation keen to welcome more international visitors as it continues to develop its tourism infrastructure and build new hotels ahead of the 2030 World Cup, which it will co-host with Spain and Portugal. The North African country sees the tournament as a golden opportunity to boost tourism and is aiming to double tourist arrivals by 2030, to a whopping 26 million annual visitors.\nIt's estimated that the country will need 100,000 extra beds as a minimum to accommodate the visiting football fans and teams, and it's been busy making up the shortfall with many international hotel chains stepping in to help. A slew of new accommodations will be opening across the country as a result, from the Waldorf Astoria in Tangier to 25 new Radisson Hotels due to open before 2030, along with many re-opening after last year's devastating earthquake. \nBarbara Podbial is a Morocco specialist adviser at travel agency Flee Winter and has been visiting the country for more than 20 years. She's seen the difference tourism has made to the country first hand.\n\"Tourism has had a positive impact in Marrakesh,\" she said. \"You can see it in the cleanliness of the streets, it's very safe, and people are not pushing you to buy things now the way they were before. But, with so many budget flights bringing in tourists, it can feel very busy.\" \nIncreasing flights into Marrakesh is certainly part of the plan when it comes to developing Morocco's tourism industry, so it's unlikely that the city will be quieter any time soon. When it comes to the World Cup, however, the spotlight will fall on the country's lesser visited cities – Casablanca, Agadir, Fez, Rabat and Tangier – where stadiums are being renovated, tourism is being further developed and hotels are being built.\nOf these locations, Barbara recommends Fez, Morocco's cultural capital, which has the largest medina in the world and is not over touristed. She also recommends day tripping from Agadir, a popular package holiday destination, to Taroudant, nicknamed \"little Marrakesh\". \"It's a short drive from Agadir and is an authentic, non-touristy city,\" she said. Also close to Agadir, the coast near the fishing village of Taghazout offers surf lessons on sandy beaches, while those planning a trip to Marrakesh can also include an excursion to the High Atlas mountains, a couple of hours drive away. \nWith the emphasis being thrown on further developing major cities in Morocco, the secret to an authentic holiday there may well be to use them as a base to discover lesser-visited spots nearby.\nSerbia doesn't have to look far to see a travel success story: in neighbouring Croatia, tourism has been a runaway hit. But while the city of Dubrovnik has had troubles with overtourism, Serbia is focusing firmly on sustainable development, working with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council to develop projects that don't encourage mass tourism, but look for a more sensitive, culture-oriented path forward. \nThis is partly because the country's tourism strategy has shifted. In the past, the focus was largely on city experiences, for example in Belgrade. However, with the realisation that tourism can help diversify rural livelihoods and improve local economies, mountain tourism, rural tourism and spa and wellness offerings have become an important part of the mix.\n\"In Serbia, people see the word 'tourist' as a positive thing,\" said George Colvin-Slee, a Serbia specialist adviser at Cox & Kings. \"It's an undiscovered place for a lot of people – we send more people to Albania and Bosnia – but it's got some really impressive spots.\"\nThe country's mountains draw skiers in winter and hikers in summer; ecotourism is developing in the hills along with birdwatching; and natural springs in the foothills feed resorts and wellness hotels. And while tourists are enjoying these nature-packed experiences, local businesses are getting a boost and jobs are getting more secure. It seems to be working: international tourism grew by 20% in 2023.\nMore like this:• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024• Five standout cities making the world a better place• Five countries with the best work-life balance\nColvin-Slee recommends visiting Novi Sad, the country's second city. \"There's Hapsburg heritage in this region, so you'll find chocolate-box buildings like in Prague and Budapest but barely anyone there in terms of tourists. The food is also Austrian-influenced – strudel and goulash – and there are some great sights, including the Petrovaradin Fortress, nicknamed the 'Gibraltar of the Danube'.\"  \nGeorgia, which borders Turkey, Russia and Azerbaijan by the Black Sea, has big plans to encourage everyone from disabled visitors and independent travellers to cruise tourists, with a vast port in Batumi, the country's second city. Its new 10-year development plan takes in everything from developing international signage so tourists can navigate the country solo, to improving accessibility, public transport and cruise ship ports as it opens up.\n\"Tourism is relatively new in Georgia,\" said Natalie Fordham, a Georgia specialist at Wild Frontiers, a tour operator specialising in offbeat and adventurous destinations. \"It offers a relatively new career path and we see really fantastic guides as a result. They're super excited to be part of it, they speak great English and learn how to adapt to different people, and many of our travellers make friends with them and want to go back.\"\nAs a developing tourism nation, some of the things you might take for granted in Western Europe –such as an extensive paved road network – are not there yet. However, there's hope that revenue from tourism will help to drive these kinds of infrastructural initiatives.\n\"Tbilisi is my favourite capital city in the world,\" said Fordham, \"with charming cobbled streets, a real aesthetic, old fortress walls, museums and more. Then you've got cave towns, Soviet architecture and history – Stalin was born here – and the northern and southern mountains, Unesco churches and monasteries, and a thriving wine and food scene. There's so much to see, you need a week-long trip at least.\" \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Attracting people to places where the sun barely shines in the peak of winter – and where temperatures can dip to -50C – might seem like a challenge, but the country has made a virtue of it, opening up sky view cabins and igloos for awe-filled aurora-focused experiences.\nTanny Por, head of international relations at Visit Greenland, is keen to emphasise that it's not a question of quantity over quality, noting that the country's goal is that 80% of the population sees tourism as something that offers a positive contribution to society. \"Airports cost a lot, so we do have to encourage a lot of tourists to come,\" she said, \"but we will be doing this in a balanced way, so as not to overrun local people.\"\nPor has just returned from a trip looking at travel opportunities in North Greenland, which will be accessible via direct international flights from 2026 when the new runway in Ilulissat opens.\n\"I went to a tiny town of 1,000 inhabitants, Qasigiannguit, and it was fantastic,\" she said. \"There are musk ox in the backcountry, historical reenactments at the local museum and so many whales! I heard them before I saw them from my bedroom, and they were everywhere we went.\"\nMorocco is another nation keen to welcome more international visitors as it continues to develop its tourism infrastructure and build new hotels ahead of the 2030 World Cup, which it will co-host with Spain and Portugal. The North African country sees the tournament as a golden opportunity to boost tourism and is aiming to double tourist arrivals by 2030, to a whopping 26 million annual visitors.\nIt's estimated that the country will need 100,000 extra beds as a minimum to accommodate the visiting football fans and teams, and it's been busy making up the shortfall with many international hotel chains stepping in to help. A slew of new accommodations will be opening across the country as a result, from the Waldorf Astoria in Tangier to 25 new Radisson Hotels due to open before 2030, along with many re-opening after last year's devastating earthquake. \nBarbara Podbial is a Morocco specialist adviser at travel agency Flee Winter and has been visiting the country for more than 20 years. She's seen the difference tourism has made to the country first hand.\n\"Tourism has had a positive impact in Marrakesh,\" she said. \"You can see it in the cleanliness of the streets, it's very safe, and people are not pushing you to buy things now the way they were before. But, with so many budget flights bringing in tourists, it can feel very busy.\" \nIncreasing flights into Marrakesh is certainly part of the plan when it comes to developing Morocco's tourism industry, so it's unlikely that the city will be quieter any time soon. When it comes to the World Cup, however, the spotlight will fall on the country's lesser visited cities – Casablanca, Agadir, Fez, Rabat and Tangier – where stadiums are being renovated, tourism is being further developed and hotels are being built.\nOf these locations, Barbara recommends Fez, Morocco's cultural capital, which has the largest medina in the world and is not over touristed. She also recommends day tripping from Agadir, a popular package holiday destination, to Taroudant, nicknamed \"little Marrakesh\". \"It's a short drive from Agadir and is an authentic, non-touristy city,\" she said. Also close to Agadir, the coast near the fishing village of Taghazout offers surf lessons on sandy beaches, while those planning a trip to Marrakesh can also include an excursion to the High Atlas mountains, a couple of hours drive away. \nWith the emphasis being thrown on further developing major cities in Morocco, the secret to an authentic holiday there may well be to use them as a base to discover lesser-visited spots nearby.\nSerbia doesn't have to look far to see a travel success story: in neighbouring Croatia, tourism has been a runaway hit. But while the city of Dubrovnik has had troubles with overtourism, Serbia is focusing firmly on sustainable development, working with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council to develop projects that don't encourage mass tourism, but look for a more sensitive, culture-oriented path forward. \nThis is partly because the country's tourism strategy has shifted. In the past, the focus was largely on city experiences, for example in Belgrade. However, with the realisation that tourism can help diversify rural livelihoods and improve local economies, mountain tourism, rural tourism and spa and wellness offerings have become an important part of the mix.\n\"In Serbia, people see the word 'tourist' as a positive thing,\" said George Colvin-Slee, a Serbia specialist adviser at Cox & Kings. \"It's an undiscovered place for a lot of people – we send more people to Albania and Bosnia – but it's got some really impressive spots.\"\nThe country's mountains draw skiers in winter and hikers in summer; ecotourism is developing in the hills along with birdwatching; and natural springs in the foothills feed resorts and wellness hotels. And while tourists are enjoying these nature-packed experiences, local businesses are getting a boost and jobs are getting more secure. It seems to be working: international tourism grew by 20% in 2023.\nMore like this:• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024• Five standout cities making the world a better place• Five countries with the best work-life balance\nColvin-Slee recommends visiting Novi Sad, the country's second city. \"There's Hapsburg heritage in this region, so you'll find chocolate-box buildings like in Prague and Budapest but barely anyone there in terms of tourists. The food is also Austrian-influenced – strudel and goulash – and there are some great sights, including the Petrovaradin Fortress, nicknamed the 'Gibraltar of the Danube'.\"  \nGeorgia, which borders Turkey, Russia and Azerbaijan by the Black Sea, has big plans to encourage everyone from disabled visitors and independent travellers to cruise tourists, with a vast port in Batumi, the country's second city. Its new 10-year development plan takes in everything from developing international signage so tourists can navigate the country solo, to improving accessibility, public transport and cruise ship ports as it opens up.\n\"Tourism is relatively new in Georgia,\" said Natalie Fordham, a Georgia specialist at Wild Frontiers, a tour operator specialising in offbeat and adventurous destinations. \"It offers a relatively new career path and we see really fantastic guides as a result. They're super excited to be part of it, they speak great English and learn how to adapt to different people, and many of our travellers make friends with them and want to go back.\"\nAs a developing tourism nation, some of the things you might take for granted in Western Europe –such as an extensive paved road network – are not there yet. However, there's hope that revenue from tourism will help to drive these kinds of infrastructural initiatives.\n\"Tbilisi is my favourite capital city in the world,\" said Fordham, \"with charming cobbled streets, a real aesthetic, old fortress walls, museums and more. Then you've got cave towns, Soviet architecture and history – Stalin was born here – and the northern and southern mountains, Unesco churches and monasteries, and a thriving wine and food scene. There's so much to see, you need a week-long trip at least.\" \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Inspired by oenology and driven by a desire to bottle the seasonal scents and flavours of the surrounding Grantchester Meadows, William has revolutionised gin-making by vacuum distilling each ingredient individually at the optimal temperature. He does this by using a 17th-Century method from British chemist Robert Boyle to blend and customise each gin to perfection, much like a perfumer or master wine maker – hence his moniker \"the world's first gin tailor\".\nHe also developed a unique distillation matrix that considers nine variables (including temperature, timing and pressure) to customise the treatment for each bottle, which is why the distillery looks like a lab. \"It's an incredibly high technological level of intervention in order to preserve that natural and unique combination of flavours, which naturally exist in a meadow,\" said William.\nAs such, the distillery is renowned for producing some of the world's most unique gins, including one derived from red wood ants foraged from Kent (cleverly named Anty Gin) in collaboration with Nordic Food Lab, as well as a citrus-led gin that contains no citrus, and a custom gin for a client who wanted a \"wet dog smell\".\nThey're also the only distillery in the world that crafts gin flavoured by Sir Isaac Newton's apple tree.\nDeveloped in exclusive collaboration with Cambridge University Botanic Garden (CUBG), the spirit, known as Curator's Gin, features rare botanicals like lemon lavender, ginger rosemary and crisp apples from Newton's legendary tree.

Here are the Hamptons culinary experiences that get her thumbs up, from classic lobster rolls to elite farm stands.\nWhen chef Olivia Tiedemann first arrived in the Hamptons to start the personal chef gig that would indirectly lead to explosive Instagram stardom, her first impression was awe.\n\"Coming from a very different lifestyle, driving up there for the very first time, where everything was so perfect,\" reminisces Tiedemann, now as famous for her punkish, bird-flipping, F-bomb dropping persona as she is for her elegantly plated dishes and the decadent pastas she whips up from scratch at midnight. \"Pulling up to my client's house; this huge, immaculate beachfront mansion. It was very magical.\"\nTiedemann is hardly alone; the Hamptons – a cluster of luxurious seaside resort towns on the eastern end of New York's Long Island – have long fascinated visitors, who flock to the area for a summertime escape to a world of white linen, cocktail parties and impossibly lavish estates.\nBut Tiedemann appreciates the Hamptons for more than its prestige: \"There's something interesting about the Hamptons, and I'm not sure scientifically what it is,\" she says. \"But the sun sets there and mirrors off both sides of the water, because it's a very long, narrow island. So the light there is different, and the sunsets are different; the sky will be entirely pink. It's very unique.\"\nAnd even better in the autumn, as the leaves turn technicolour and the crowds disperse. \"Nobody's there anymore,\" says Tiedemann. \"The autumn is kind of a secret time where places are still open – lots close in the winter. Last summer, I stayed through the autumn, and it was really cool to go to all those places without having to see five million people. There's little wine bars and vineyards that are really scenic and pretty. And they need business during that time. I almost don't even want to tell the secret of how much nicer it is.\"\nThe food scene in the Hamptons is tied to the bounty of the Atlantic coast – lobster and clams reign supreme – as well as the island's thriving farm culture. Farm-to-table experiences abound, as do glamorous restaurants with dishes (and patrons) ripped straight from the pages of a celebrity magazine. But there are down to earth delights as well – chef-approved.\nHere are Tiedemann's top culinary experiences in the Hamptons – in summertime and beyond.\nThe Hamptons are notorious for being wildly posh. For a spendy yet still \"really cool\" experience, Tiedemann likes The Crow's Nest on Montauk Lake. \"This place is sick,\" declares Tiedemann. \"The first time I went there, me and my friend were, like, we just entered a dreamscape.\"\nThe Crow's Nest restaurant, an opulent wood-on-wood coastal oasis in the Crow's Nest Hotel serves upscale New American and Mediterranean-inspired seafood dishes. \"It almost has a tiki vibe, but that's not what it is. The food is really good; really fresh seafood,\" says Tiedemann. \"There's a little beach with a little beach bar on it, and it's overlooking the water. It's just so perfect and pretty. And because of the Hamptons light thing, you feel like you're sitting in the most beautiful place you've ever seen, having a perfect cocktail surrounded by people in flowy white outfits… amazing!\"\nTiedemann's Crow's Nest pick is the tuna tartare with black caramel, cucumber, radish, smoked mango and avocado. \"It was crazy good,\" she says. \"They wouldn't tell me what they did, but it was so good.

People are afraid to be creative with the lobster roll because it's so culturally tied. I don't [care]. I just want it to be good.\"\nLobster roll lovers will not only find classic lobster rolls with and without mayonnaise, but a slew of inventive rolls, like the Diablo with spicy tomatoes, in a variety of sizes. \"So you're not committing,\" says Tiedemann. \"That was a smart move on their behalf, and it's really good.\"\nAlternatively, Bostwick's on the Harbor in East Hampton serves the quintessential lobster roll: \"The straight up classic.

It's all outside seating, but there's always a lot of people there. You just drive up, very casual.

After attending culinary school and cooking in restaurants, Tiedemann became a private chef in the Hamptons where she quickly garnered a massive global audience of 4.", "Chef Olivia Tiedemann loves flipping the bird to convention. Here are the Hamptons culinary experiences that get her thumbs up, from classic lobster rolls to elite farm stands.\nWhen chef Olivia Tiedemann first arrived in the Hamptons to start the personal chef gig that would indirectly lead to explosive Instagram stardom, her first impression was awe.\n\"Coming from a very different lifestyle, driving up there for the very first time, where everything was so perfect,\" reminisces Tiedemann, now as famous for her punkish, bird-flipping, F-bomb dropping persona as she is for her elegantly plated dishes and the decadent pastas she whips up from scratch at midnight. \"Pulling up to my client's house; this huge, immaculate beachfront mansion. It was very magical.\"\nTiedemann is hardly alone; the Hamptons – a cluster of luxurious seaside resort towns on the eastern end of New York's Long Island – have long fascinated visitors, who flock to the area for a summertime escape to a world of white linen, cocktail parties and impossibly lavish estates.\nBut Tiedemann appreciates the Hamptons for more than its prestige: \"There's something interesting about the Hamptons, and I'm not sure scientifically what it is,\" she says. \"But the sun sets there and mirrors off both sides of the water, because it's a very long, narrow island. So the light there is different, and the sunsets are different; the sky will be entirely pink. It's very unique.\"\nAnd even better in the autumn, as the leaves turn technicolour and the crowds disperse. \"Nobody's there anymore,\" says Tiedemann. \"The autumn is kind of a secret time where places are still open – lots close in the winter. Last summer, I stayed through the autumn, and it was really cool to go to all those places without having to see five million people. There's little wine bars and vineyards that are really scenic and pretty. And they need business during that time. I almost don't even want to tell the secret of how much nicer it is.\"\nThe food scene in the Hamptons is tied to the bounty of the Atlantic coast – lobster and clams reign supreme – as well as the island's thriving farm culture. Farm-to-table experiences abound, as do glamorous restaurants with dishes (and patrons) ripped straight from the pages of a celebrity magazine. But there are down to earth delights as well – chef-approved.\nHere are Tiedemann's top culinary experiences in the Hamptons – in summertime and beyond.\nThe Hamptons are notorious for being wildly posh. For a spendy yet still \"really cool\" experience, Tiedemann likes The Crow's Nest on Montauk Lake. \"This place is sick,\" declares Tiedemann. \"The first time I went there, me and my friend were, like, we just entered a dreamscape.\"\nThe Crow's Nest restaurant, an opulent wood-on-wood coastal oasis in the Crow's Nest Hotel serves upscale New American and Mediterranean-inspired seafood dishes. \"It almost has a tiki vibe, but that's not what it is. The food is really good; really fresh seafood,\" says Tiedemann. \"There's a little beach with a little beach bar on it, and it's overlooking the water. It's just so perfect and pretty. And because of the Hamptons light thing, you feel like you're sitting in the most beautiful place you've ever seen, having a perfect cocktail surrounded by people in flowy white outfits… amazing!\"\nTiedemann's Crow's Nest pick is the tuna tartare with black caramel, cucumber, radish, smoked mango and avocado. \"It was crazy good,\" she says. \"They wouldn't tell me what they did, but it was so good. I would go back anytime.\"\nWebsite: https://www.crowsnestmtk.com/Address: 4 Old West Lake Dr, Montauk, NY 11954Phone: +16316682077Instagram: @crowsnestmtkWalk-ins only\nWhile in the Hamptons, day trippers, summer residents and celebs alike devour fresh New England seafood. Like lobster rolls – hunks of succulent lobster meat stuffed in a griddled split-top hot dog bun, dressed in mayonnaise (Maine style) or melted butter (New England style). Personal chefs love the coastal delicacy, too: \"This summer, I went on a quest to find the best lobster roll ever,\" says Tiedemann. The winners? Shinnecock Lobster Factory and Bostwick's on the Harbor.\nShinnecock Lobster Factory, a burgundy-painted wooden shack on the Shinnecock Indian reservation in Southampton, serves all manner of seafood delights, from fish burgers to lobster mac and cheese. But for Tiedemann, its lobster roll is king. \"I love a lobster roll,\" she says. \"I don't really like mayo. I hate it when places only offer mayo. People are afraid to be creative with the lobster roll because it's so culturally tied. I don't [care]. I just want it to be good.\"\nLobster roll lovers will not only find classic lobster rolls with and without mayonnaise, but a slew of inventive rolls, like the Diablo with spicy tomatoes, in a variety of sizes. \"So you're not committing,\" says Tiedemann. \"That was a smart move on their behalf, and it's really good.\"\nAlternatively, Bostwick's on the Harbor in East Hampton serves the quintessential lobster roll: \"The straight up classic. It's butter, it's lobster meat, it's a good bun. It's a greasy experience, and it's supposed to be.\"\nWebsite: https://shinnecocklobsterfactory.com/Address: 42 Montauk Hwy, Southampton, NY 11968Phone: +16312593334Instagram: @shinnecocklobster\nWebsite: https://www.bostwicksontheharbor.com/Address: 39 Gann Rd, East Hampton, NY 11937Phone: +16313241150Instagram: @bostwicks_on_the_harbor\nLittle about the Hamptons can be deemed casual, but Tiedemann has a spot for when you just need to hang loose. \"I love the Clam Bar,\" she says. \"You're gonna sit out there with your friends and you're gonna drink beer out of a can and eat fried clams.\"\nThe Clam Bar, a fish shack on Montauk Highway heading east out of Amagansett, has been feeding stomachs and souls for more than 40 years with fresh New England seafood dishes; both traditional (clam chowder, oysters on the half shell) and not (sushi dogs, tuna poke nachos).\n\"The Clam Bar is really fun,\" says Tiedemann. \"It's very iconic when you see that place; it looks like somewhere you'd want to stop on a drive. It's all outside seating, but there's always a lot of people there. You just drive up, very casual. Sit outside.\"\nTiedemann's order? \"The clam strips… it's just a good vibe and it's solid food.\"\nWebsite: https://clambarhamptons.com/Address: 2025 Montauk Hwy, Amagansett, NY 11930Phone: +16312676348Instagram: @theclambar\nTiedemann's recommendation for a quick yet gourmet meal is Round Swamp Farm country market; a collective of farm stands that also sells prepared foods. \"Out [in the Hamptons], it can be really difficult to find a quick bite,\" says Tiedemann. \"As a chef, I stop there to pick up ingredients and [it's] where I get lunch, too.\"\nAmong the market's vast variety of offerings are savoury dishes like seared salmon, mushroom lasagna and shrimp po' boys, while sweet tooths can find cookies, pies and muffins; perfect for a nosh between extravagant summer parties or an impromptu picnic on the seashore.\n\"They're cooking them constantly and refreshing them, because it has a cult following,\" says Tiedemann. \"You might have to elbow somebody to get your tacos.

The World Stone Skimming Championships were started in 1983 by Albert Baker.", "But each year, hundreds of competitors and spectators flock to the island from around the world for what might be the island’s biggest event: the World Stone Skimming Championships.", "Not all rock stars play guitars: every September, the Hebridean island of Easdale plays host to the world's most fanatical stone skimmers.\nIt was pouring, hard and heavy. The rain was falling like marbles, the wind was whirling and the air was thick with the reek of whisky. At the heart of this scene was Lynsay McGeachy, competitive amateur golfer, mountain biker and head gin distiller at Beinn an Tuirc in Kintyre, and she was the image of cool as she prepared to take centre stage.\nThe mood was electric, like a rock concert, with the gathered crowd heckling support. But McGeachy was not listening, nor preparing to tee-off, mountain bike or take part in any other everyday sport. She was about to skim a stone, feeling its cold hard edges on her fingertips, clinging to it with competitive seriousness. \nSeconds later, following a waist-high baseball-style pitch, the flat-bottomed slate pebble spun 42m across the waterlogged quarry in front of her, hovering and zinging through the air as if a drunken dragonfly. It twirled into the air 15 times. In her own words, it was an \"absolute belter\".\n\"I'm struggling to find stones to train with this year because I've thrown so many away,\" said McGeachy, who estimates she skims some 160 rocks each week during her practice sessions on Torrisdale Beach in Kintyre, a peninsula on Scotland's south-west coast. For her, stone skimming is more of a calling than a career. \"I've skimmed ever since I was a child. The key is to find smooth pebbles with a level underside. They spin so much faster.\"\nA show-off demonstration of almost superhuman wrist skills, competitive stone skimming is a sport so unusual it can give spectators tingly fingers just watching. This time last year, McGeachy's 42m throw was enough to see her crowned overall adult female champion at the World Stone Skimming Championships on Easdale Island near Oban in Argyll, and it is where one of the world's strangest sports has been competed nearly every September since 1997.\nTaking place at one of Easdale's amphitheatre-shaped flooded quarries, the championship is a low-key if unorthodox get-together organised by some of the island's 60 residents, including the pub landlord, ferryman and the island’s one doctor. What's more, the event is intercut with local rivalries and beery good humour, and it is a place where anyone can join in for the £10 entry fee. There's just one pub, one community hall and one museum that tells the story of the quarriers who first populated the island, yet enough wild topography for everyone.\nWhat's also remarkable is the island's inaccessibility – it's in the middle of the Slate Islands in the Firth of Lorn – and its inescapable beauty, which leaves visitors with the impression that man and nature came to an understanding long ago and stuck to it. Reverence for slate runs deep here and the interaction between the stone and those who live on Easdale is in their DNA.\n\"There's so much pride and positivity on Easdale because of stone skimming,\" said community doctor Kyle Mathews, originally from Portadown, Northern Ireland, who now acts as head judge, host and co-organiser of the championships. \"The quarry isn't locked up like Centre Court at Wimbledon. So, it brings people to the island all year round.\"\nThis year's finals take place across the weekend of 7 September, and the challenge for organisers is the limited infrastructure and accommodation to cater for the 1,000 curious spectators who turn up. Event entry is also capped at 350 skimmers, despite the tournament's popularity. In fact, this month's contest sold out in 29 minutes and demand was such from the 700 hopefuls that the event website crashed.\nOver the weekend, Mathews' duties are to marshall the event from the \"Skim of Destiny\", the platform from which throwers hurl their stones across the half-drowned quarry, and referee any disputed results. All skimmers must compete with rocks made from naturally formed Easdale slate and be no more than 7.6cm in diameter, with each stone fitting into a carefully selected measuring gauge to make sure no one has an unfair advantage.\nYet there is no doubt that this sport is thrilling. Last year, eight-time champion and Scottish fan favourite Dougie Isaacs hit the back wall of the competition quarry with such force that there was sheer bedlam. \"There were air horns going off and the cheer from the crowd was so loud it was heard on the neighbouring island of Seil,\" recalled Mathews. \"That's a hard atmosphere to bottle.\"\nLike a bad joke, the story goes that the idea for the tournament originated around 40 years ago, beginning with an Englishman, Scotsman and Irishman walking into a bar – in this case, the island's only pub, The Puffer. It ended after far too much drink and a skimming competition that finished just before sunrise.\nThose of a more skeptical nature might suggest the idea should never have left the pub. But the point is still to bring the island together, and the driving force behind it remains Eilean Eisdeal, a community development group. As a charity fundraiser, last year's event raised £9,000 for the school and community hall – and the motivation is help safeguard the island's future.\nOnce prosperous due to its reputation for slate cut from its seven quarries for the global housing industry, Easdale's primary trade fell into abrupt decline in the 1850s after a historic storm flooded the pits. Today, the smooth stones left behind are full of meaning, yet only used for competitive skimming. The last slate was cut in 1950. \nMore like this:• The unknown story of Scotland's 'Stonehenge'• The Scottish isle you can only visit on a day trip• Why surfers are flocking to Scotland\nThis history is told at the Easdale Island Folk Museum, providing a melancholic counterpoint to today's upbeat skimming training regimes. Routinely, shoulders and wrists are stretched, hips are twisted in yoga -like moves and fingers twanged as if elastic bands. Injuries are rife, too, says six-time entrant Alex Lewis, a previous winner of multiple stone skimming contests, including the British, Welsh, All England and Swiss Stone Skimming Championships.\n\"Most days, I train to make sure I don't get injured when competing,\" explained the Stirling-based economics student, while describing his daily ritual. Wrist and shoulders are exercised, he said, plus flexibility conditioning is vital to ensure throws of more than 100m on a consistent basis without torn ligaments or muscles. \"Cortisone injections are all too commonplace these days, sadly.\"\nLooming large in Lewis's mind is last year's Welsh Open, when the former competitive javelin thrower tossed an unofficial world record distance of 147.7m – twice the length of the Easdale quarry – with his stone jumping around 50-60 times. Frustratingly, he's still awaiting confirmation from Guinness World Records.\n\"I'm certainly driven to achieve more, but I also find this sport immensely therapeutic, and I do it because I love it,\" Lewis explained. \"As strange as it may sound, this is a great community to be part of… we thrive on talking about how rocks interact with water. Which, of course, is weird to many people.\"\nTo land the longest throw in a competition is no easy feat for any sportsperson. But in stone skimming, particularly on Argyll's tempestuous Atlantic coast, there is always the weather to contend with and the wind's effect on the quarry water. In calm conditions on Easdale, a three-toss performance could equally result in one stone curving wildly out of the marked course, with urgent waves chasing it.\n\"It might be the perfect stone and perfect throw, but then a rogue swell spins your attempt off-course,\" said Lewis. \"So, a lot is down to luck. Anyone can win.\"\nThat anyone from anywhere in the world can take part regardless of ability, age, or experience, and go on to glory is all part of Easdale's exhilarating appeal. But so, too, is the beautiful complexity of its geography.\nHere, the saying goes, no stone is left unturned.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

{"id": 467, "question": "How much money did last year's event raise for the school and community hall?", "answer": ["£9,000"], "doc": ["Scoop 2024 is slated for July 12 - 13.

Join us at these fun and casual events to meet more members of your community! Follow Chelmsford Community Center on Facebook for ongoing and upcoming events.", "Not all rock stars play guitars: every September, the Hebridean island of Easdale plays host to the world's most fanatical stone skimmers.\nIt was pouring, hard and heavy. The rain was falling like marbles, the wind was whirling and the air was thick with the reek of whisky. At the heart of this scene was Lynsay McGeachy, competitive amateur golfer, mountain biker and head gin distiller at Beinn an Tuirc in Kintyre, and she was the image of cool as she prepared to take centre stage.\nThe mood was electric, like a rock concert, with the gathered crowd heckling support. But McGeachy was not listening, nor preparing to tee-off, mountain bike or take part in any other everyday sport. She was about to skim a stone, feeling its cold hard edges on her fingertips, clinging to it with competitive seriousness. \nSeconds later, following a waist-high baseball-style pitch, the flat-bottomed slate pebble spun 42m across the waterlogged quarry in front of her, hovering and zinging through the air as if a drunken dragonfly. It twirled into the air 15 times. In her own words, it was an \"absolute belter\".\n\"I'm struggling to find stones to train with this year because I've thrown so many away,\" said McGeachy, who estimates she skims some 160 rocks each week during her practice sessions on Torrisdale Beach in Kintyre, a peninsula on Scotland's south-west coast. For her, stone skimming is more of a calling than a career. \"I've skimmed ever since I was a child. The key is to find smooth pebbles with a level underside. They spin so much faster.\"\nA show-off demonstration of almost superhuman wrist skills, competitive stone skimming is a sport so unusual it can give spectators tingly fingers just watching. This time last year, McGeachy's 42m throw was enough to see her crowned overall adult female champion at the World Stone Skimming Championships on Easdale Island near Oban in Argyll, and it is where one of the world's strangest sports has been competed nearly every September since 1997.\nTaking place at one of Easdale's amphitheatre-shaped flooded quarries, the championship is a low-key if unorthodox get-together organised by some of the island's 60 residents, including the pub landlord, ferryman and the island’s one doctor. What's more, the event is intercut with local rivalries and beery good humour, and it is a place where anyone can join in for the £10 entry fee. There's just one pub, one community hall and one museum that tells the story of the quarriers who first populated the island, yet enough wild topography for everyone.\nWhat's also remarkable is the island's inaccessibility – it's in the middle of the Slate Islands in the Firth of Lorn – and its inescapable beauty, which leaves visitors with the impression that man and nature came to an understanding long ago and stuck to it. Reverence for slate runs deep here and the interaction between the stone and those who live on Easdale is in their DNA.\n\"There's so much pride and positivity on Easdale because of stone skimming,\" said community doctor Kyle Mathews, originally from Portadown, Northern Ireland, who now acts as head judge, host and co-organiser of the championships. \"The quarry isn't locked up like Centre Court at Wimbledon. So, it brings people to the island all year round.\"\nThis year's finals take place across the weekend of 7 September, and the challenge for organisers is the limited infrastructure and accommodation to cater for the 1,000 curious spectators who turn up. Event entry is also capped at 350 skimmers, despite the tournament's popularity. In fact, this month's contest sold out in 29 minutes and demand was such from the 700 hopefuls that the event website crashed.\nOver the weekend, Mathews' duties are to marshall the event from the \"Skim of Destiny\", the platform from which throwers hurl their stones across the half-drowned quarry, and referee any disputed results. All skimmers must compete with rocks made from naturally formed Easdale slate and be no more than 7.6cm in diameter, with each stone fitting into a carefully selected measuring gauge to make sure no one has an unfair advantage.\nYet there is no doubt that this sport is thrilling. Last year, eight-time champion and Scottish fan favourite Dougie Isaacs hit the back wall of the competition quarry with such force that there was sheer bedlam. \"There were air horns going off and the cheer from the crowd was so loud it was heard on the neighbouring island of Seil,\" recalled Mathews. \"That's a hard atmosphere to bottle.\"\nLike a bad joke, the story goes that the idea for the tournament originated around 40 years ago, beginning with an Englishman, Scotsman and Irishman walking into a bar – in this case, the island's only pub, The Puffer. It ended after far too much drink and a skimming competition that finished just before sunrise.\nThose of a more skeptical nature might suggest the idea should never have left the pub. But the point is still to bring the island together, and the driving force behind it remains Eilean Eisdeal, a community development group. As a charity fundraiser, last year's event raised £9,000 for the school and community hall – and the motivation is help safeguard the island's future.\nOnce prosperous due to its reputation for slate cut from its seven quarries for the global housing industry, Easdale's primary trade fell into abrupt decline in the 1850s after a historic storm flooded the pits. Today, the smooth stones left behind are full of meaning, yet only used for competitive skimming. The last slate was cut in 1950. \nMore like this:• The unknown story of Scotland's 'Stonehenge'• The Scottish isle you can only visit on a day trip• Why surfers are flocking to Scotland\nThis history is told at the Easdale Island Folk Museum, providing a melancholic counterpoint to today's upbeat skimming training regimes. Routinely, shoulders and wrists are stretched, hips are twisted in yoga -like moves and fingers twanged as if elastic bands. Injuries are rife, too, says six-time entrant Alex Lewis, a previous winner of multiple stone skimming contests, including the British, Welsh, All England and Swiss Stone Skimming Championships.\n\"Most days, I train to make sure I don't get injured when competing,\" explained the Stirling-based economics student, while describing his daily ritual. Wrist and shoulders are exercised, he said, plus flexibility conditioning is vital to ensure throws of more than 100m on a consistent basis without torn ligaments or muscles. \"Cortisone injections are all too commonplace these days, sadly.\"\nLooming large in Lewis's mind is last year's Welsh Open, when the former competitive javelin thrower tossed an unofficial world record distance of 147.7m – twice the length of the Easdale quarry – with his stone jumping around 50-60 times. Frustratingly, he's still awaiting confirmation from Guinness World Records.\n\"I'm certainly driven to achieve more, but I also find this sport immensely therapeutic, and I do it because I love it,\" Lewis explained. \"As strange as it may sound, this is a great community to be part of… we thrive on talking about how rocks interact with water. Which, of course, is weird to many people.\"\nTo land the longest throw in a competition is no easy feat for any sportsperson. But in stone skimming, particularly on Argyll's tempestuous Atlantic coast, there is always the weather to contend with and the wind's effect on the quarry water. In calm conditions on Easdale, a three-toss performance could equally result in one stone curving wildly out of the marked course, with urgent waves chasing it.\n\"It might be the perfect stone and perfect throw, but then a rogue swell spins your attempt off-course,\" said Lewis. \"So, a lot is down to luck. Anyone can win.\"\nThat anyone from anywhere in the world can take part regardless of ability, age, or experience, and go on to glory is all part of Easdale's exhilarating appeal.

Along with this variety, other pre-phylloxera ones are used, such as sousón, caíño (largo, bravo and tinto), brancellao and merenzao.", "Wine production in Ribeira Sacra is small-scale; 20% of the DO’s wineries make less than 5,000 bottles per vintage, and the region’s reds make a wonderful introduction to some of Spain’s most exciting native grapes.

No posts Ready for more?", "Check it out: The primary grape varieties from Ribeira Sacra are, starting with reds, Mencia, Brancellao, Merenzao and the famous Tempranillo, while predominant white varieties are Albarino, Godello and Treixadura, three well known varieties in Nortwestern Spain.", "The region's predominant grape is Mencía, traditionally used to make fresh, young reds, though winemakers are increasingly adding a little Brancellao, Sousón, and Caíño, and even aging some of these earthy, aromatic blends, as well as producing beautifully floral whites starring the Godello grape.", "Ribeira Sacra is in the Nortwestern part of Spain, close to the border with Portugal The vine cultivation origin in this area dates thousands of years back. Yes, you've read that right, THOUSANDS. of years back - About two thousand years ago, the Romans arrived to Galicia and brought their customs and habits with them, including winemaking.", "In the Ribeira Sacra's dizzyingly high landscapes, near-vertical vineyards are perched above rivers. The stunning scenery – and the resulting wines – are an oenophile's dream.\nA mosaic of stone and trees, the mountains stretched out toward the horizon while below me the river sliced through this unyielding mass of granite as if it were made of sponge. Peering down the pitched slopes of the Sil Canyon from the Cabezoás overlook – more than 700m high – I gained new respect for the incredible power of water (while thanking the sturdy beams that were holding me up).\nVertiginous views are a hallmark of the Ribeira Sacra, a collection of small towns that mostly hug the Sil and Miño rivers in Galicia, Spain's north-westernmost region. Galicia is often referred to as \"green Spain\" for its verdant landscapes, the product of frequent rainfall compared to elsewhere in Spain, but it's these two rivers that have shaped the Ribeira Sacra, the region’s most inland corner. The name means \"sacred riverbank\" in the Galician language, a nod to both the topography and the area's long monasterial history, dating to Roman times.\nIt's not the easiest terrain to cross, filled with narrow winding roads that wrap around hills and cut through stands of chestnuts and oaks. As I left Cabezoás, I headed west to the region's main monastery, Santo Estevo de Ribas de Sil, about 7km away as the crow flies, but nearly double the distance by car. Nested high above the Sil River, Santo Estevo has been beautifully restored and is now part of Spain's national network of paradores (state-run hotels often housed in historic structures). Although it is first mentioned in documents from the 10th Century, the monastery is believed to be several centuries older than that. It includes three cloisters, a church and the monks' quarters, and I couldn't help but wonder how they built such a massive compound back then on the rim of a mountain\nThose monks definitely had an eye for prime real estate, but the miradoiros (scenic overlooks) I passed along the way provided a different kind of religious experience. Like Cabezoás, they jut out over the edges of cliffs, mocking gravity and offering vistas that will fill your heart or stop it cold, depending on how you feel about heights. Water has forged its own green cathedrals here, more monumental than even the most spectacular structures built by humans.\nIn fact, the Ribeira Sacra was declared a biosphere reserve in 2022, and it is Spain's only nomination for Unesco World Heritage status in 2024. The application revolves around the central place of water in this landscape. Beyond the production of hydroelectric power, the rivers have propelled a long history of milling – corn and other grains – but it's the nearly vertical vineyards along their banks that play a starring role.\nWinemaking took off after the arrival of the Romans and the monastic orders that followed them. The region's predominant grape is Mencía, traditionally used to make fresh, young reds, though winemakers are increasingly adding a little Brancellao, Sousón, and Caíño, and even aging some of these earthy, aromatic blends, as well as producing beautifully floral whites starring the Godello grape. For a long time, wine quality suffered here, hindered by rural poverty and tangled land-inheritance laws, but the Ribeira Sacra's star has risen sharply over the past decade, with connoisseurs now seeking out its boutique bottlings.\nIt is also a naturally sustainable wine region, as no other approach would work over the long term. Because of the terrain, grape growers must harvest by hand, carrying heavy crates on their shoulders, as they advance carefully down row after acrophobia-inducing row of vines. To help with this gruelling work, a few vineyards use rails, along which grapes can be moved in small motorised containers – either up toward narrow clearings where they can be loaded onto a truck, or down to the river for boat transport – but this is not an option for most.\nEstablished as an official wine region in 1996, the Ribeira Sacra holds \"heroic viticulture\" designation, awarded by an Italian nonprofit that promotes and protects mountainous wine regions around the world. To qualify for the title, your terraced vineyards must have a minimum altitude of 500m and a gradient above 30%. When I met winemaker Puri Díaz Ferreiro, she casually referred to local vineyards as paredes (walls), which makes sense when you consider that a 70% slope is not unusual. She rightly marvelled at what must have gone into creating these terraces. \"It was an immense job to build these walls and ensure they don't collapse. They've lasted for centuries.\"\nMost wineries here are small operations, like Díaz Ferreiro’s Val do Frade, based in the town of A Pobra do Brollón. Working alone, she grows grapes on two half-hectare plots, one of them perched on a luxuriantly green ridge high above the Sil River. During harvest, she hires extra hands to move her grapes to the Adegas de Vilachá complex 2km away, where she produces just 3,000 bottles per year of a young red made with Mencía. Now an ethnographic centre, these rustic cellars date to medieval times and were traditionally used by families to make and store wine for their own consumption. Every midday, folks would head there on foot, via a narrow path, and bring home enough wine for the day's meals. While the complex has 42 separate cellars, just 12 are currently in use, and Díaz Ferreiro's is the sole commercial operation. \nHer vineyards can only be accessed on foot, from above. While I found the lush highland scenery to be breathtaking, I wanted to get closer to the water, so I headed west to the village of Belesar to meet Martín Martínez. Established in 2020, his Ecosacra winery is what's known locally as an adega de garda (storage winery), where wine that's been made elsewhere is kept in cool, north-facing cellars. More than three centuries old, his adega had been abandoned for 14 years when he bought and restored it, even reusing old wine barrels to make shelving and tables. It's a beautifully rustic space overlooking the Miño River, with an outdoor patio where you can try his wines – a white made with the Godello grape and a red Mencía-dominated blend – while dining on local cheese, charcuterie and empanadas (Galician large-format baked meat or fish pies), accompanied by tomatoes, figs and cherries from his own garden.\nTo reach Ecosacra, I booked a tour that included a magical journey on Martínez's small boat. As we glided past forested riverbanks so densely green they could pass for Tolkien's Shire, I was humbled by the view of those mindboggling vineyards; it was beyond me how those first grape-growers ever conceived of farming this terrain. But even more remarkable was the canyon itself, a testament to the sheer force of water across geological time.\nEcosacra's name reflects Martínez's commitment to protecting his natural resources. Like Díaz Ferreiro, he takes a low-intervention approach in his vineyards, conserving the soil's health and using no herbicides or insecticides, and his small catamaran is the first hybrid passenger boat in the area. As we chatted, he proudly told me about the otters that were spotted near his private pier. \"I spend most days on the river, but I never get bored of this place. It’s paradise to me.\"\nThe team behind local event company I-Radia Crea felt the same way when they created 17 Grados, a music festival that highlights the landscape. Named for the vineyards' minimum slope in degrees, the lineup features concerts at a hilltop winery, but the most coveted events take place on a catamaran with a maximum capacity of 100. Listening to music while cruising between the steep walls of the Sil Canyon is a transcendent experience, transporting you physically and metaphorically. \nMore like this:• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024• How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism• A new record at the world's biggest snail-eating festival\nTo protect the very qualities that make the area so unique, government officials are beginning to take a more mindful approach, learning hard lessons from other parts of Spain where overtourism has sparked the rage of local residents. In its promotional materials, the tourism board encourages visitors to arrive by RENFE, the national train system, which stops in the region’s largest municipality, Monforte de Lemos (population: 18,000). There are also free hop-on hop-off minibus shuttles to reduce car traffic during the summer and Holy Week peak seasons; and the most popular attractions – such as the ancient Santa Cristina de Ribas de Sil monastery and the wineries themselves – require advance reservations to manage visitor volume.\nIt's not easy to balance environmental protection with the real economic needs of the Ribeira Sacra's small towns, which might otherwise be abandoned, like so many in rural Spain. But in a region where survival has long depended on nature, there is still a deep connection to the environment, and many locals are focused on conserving what they've inherited. When Díaz Ferreiro first started growing grapes, some of her neighbours would describe the ways they pruned each plant in their vineyards.\nAt the time, she couldn't imagine anyone having such an intimate understanding of individual vines, but now she has become one of those people. \"I don’t know how to explain it, but it is something that you just have to feel,\" she said. \"We are in contact with the earth, the plants and everything else around us.

Galicia is often referred to as \"green Spain\" for its verdant landscapes, the product of frequent rainfall compared to elsewhere in Spain, but it's these two rivers that have shaped the Ribeira Sacra, the region’s most inland corner. The name means \"sacred riverbank\" in the Galician language, a nod to both the topography and the area's long monasterial history, dating to Roman times.\nIt's not the easiest terrain to cross, filled with narrow winding roads that wrap around hills and cut through stands of chestnuts and oaks. As I left Cabezoás, I headed west to the region's main monastery, Santo Estevo de Ribas de Sil, about 7km away as the crow flies, but nearly double the distance by car. Nested high above the Sil River, Santo Estevo has been beautifully restored and is now part of Spain's national network of paradores (state-run hotels often housed in historic structures). Although it is first mentioned in documents from the 10th Century, the monastery is believed to be several centuries older than that. It includes three cloisters, a church and the monks' quarters, and I couldn't help but wonder how they built such a massive compound back then on the rim of a mountain\nThose monks definitely had an eye for prime real estate, but the miradoiros (scenic overlooks) I passed along the way provided a different kind of religious experience. Like Cabezoás, they jut out over the edges of cliffs, mocking gravity and offering vistas that will fill your heart or stop it cold, depending on how you feel about heights. Water has forged its own green cathedrals here, more monumental than even the most spectacular structures built by humans.\nIn fact, the Ribeira Sacra was declared a biosphere reserve in 2022, and it is Spain's only nomination for Unesco World Heritage status in 2024. The application revolves around the central place of water in this landscape. Beyond the production of hydroelectric power, the rivers have propelled a long history of milling – corn and other grains – but it's the nearly vertical vineyards along their banks that play a starring role.\nWinemaking took off after the arrival of the Romans and the monastic orders that followed them. The region's predominant grape is Mencía, traditionally used to make fresh, young reds, though winemakers are increasingly adding a little Brancellao, Sousón, and Caíño, and even aging some of these earthy, aromatic blends, as well as producing beautifully floral whites starring the Godello grape. For a long time, wine quality suffered here, hindered by rural poverty and tangled land-inheritance laws, but the Ribeira Sacra's star has risen sharply over the past decade, with connoisseurs now seeking out its boutique bottlings.\nIt is also a naturally sustainable wine region, as no other approach would work over the long term. Because of the terrain, grape growers must harvest by hand, carrying heavy crates on their shoulders, as they advance carefully down row after acrophobia-inducing row of vines. To help with this gruelling work, a few vineyards use rails, along which grapes can be moved in small motorised containers – either up toward narrow clearings where they can be loaded onto a truck, or down to the river for boat transport – but this is not an option for most.\nEstablished as an official wine region in 1996, the Ribeira Sacra holds \"heroic viticulture\" designation, awarded by an Italian nonprofit that promotes and protects mountainous wine regions around the world. To qualify for the title, your terraced vineyards must have a minimum altitude of 500m and a gradient above 30%. When I met winemaker Puri Díaz Ferreiro, she casually referred to local vineyards as paredes (walls), which makes sense when you consider that a 70% slope is not unusual. She rightly marvelled at what must have gone into creating these terraces. \"It was an immense job to build these walls and ensure they don't collapse. They've lasted for centuries.\"\nMost wineries here are small operations, like Díaz Ferreiro’s Val do Frade, based in the town of A Pobra do Brollón. Working alone, she grows grapes on two half-hectare plots, one of them perched on a luxuriantly green ridge high above the Sil River. During harvest, she hires extra hands to move her grapes to the Adegas de Vilachá complex 2km away, where she produces just 3,000 bottles per year of a young red made with Mencía. Now an ethnographic centre, these rustic cellars date to medieval times and were traditionally used by families to make and store wine for their own consumption. Every midday, folks would head there on foot, via a narrow path, and bring home enough wine for the day's meals. While the complex has 42 separate cellars, just 12 are currently in use, and Díaz Ferreiro's is the sole commercial operation. \nHer vineyards can only be accessed on foot, from above. While I found the lush highland scenery to be breathtaking, I wanted to get closer to the water, so I headed west to the village of Belesar to meet Martín Martínez. Established in 2020, his Ecosacra winery is what's known locally as an adega de garda (storage winery), where wine that's been made elsewhere is kept in cool, north-facing cellars. More than three centuries old, his adega had been abandoned for 14 years when he bought and restored it, even reusing old wine barrels to make shelving and tables. It's a beautifully rustic space overlooking the Miño River, with an outdoor patio where you can try his wines – a white made with the Godello grape and a red Mencía-dominated blend – while dining on local cheese, charcuterie and empanadas (Galician large-format baked meat or fish pies), accompanied by tomatoes, figs and cherries from his own garden.\nTo reach Ecosacra, I booked a tour that included a magical journey on Martínez's small boat. As we glided past forested riverbanks so densely green they could pass for Tolkien's Shire, I was humbled by the view of those mindboggling vineyards; it was beyond me how those first grape-growers ever conceived of farming this terrain. But even more remarkable was the canyon itself, a testament to the sheer force of water across geological time.\nEcosacra's name reflects Martínez's commitment to protecting his natural resources. Like Díaz Ferreiro, he takes a low-intervention approach in his vineyards, conserving the soil's health and using no herbicides or insecticides, and his small catamaran is the first hybrid passenger boat in the area. As we chatted, he proudly told me about the otters that were spotted near his private pier. \"I spend most days on the river, but I never get bored of this place. It’s paradise to me.\"\nThe team behind local event company I-Radia Crea felt the same way when they created 17 Grados, a music festival that highlights the landscape. Named for the vineyards' minimum slope in degrees, the lineup features concerts at a hilltop winery, but the most coveted events take place on a catamaran with a maximum capacity of 100. Listening to music while cruising between the steep walls of the Sil Canyon is a transcendent experience, transporting you physically and metaphorically. \nMore like this:• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024• How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism• A new record at the world's biggest snail-eating festival\nTo protect the very qualities that make the area so unique, government officials are beginning to take a more mindful approach, learning hard lessons from other parts of Spain where overtourism has sparked the rage of local residents. In its promotional materials, the tourism board encourages visitors to arrive by RENFE, the national train system, which stops in the region’s largest municipality, Monforte de Lemos (population: 18,000). There are also free hop-on hop-off minibus shuttles to reduce car traffic during the summer and Holy Week peak seasons; and the most popular attractions – such as the ancient Santa Cristina de Ribas de Sil monastery and the wineries themselves – require advance reservations to manage visitor volume.\nIt's not easy to balance environmental protection with the real economic needs of the Ribeira Sacra's small towns, which might otherwise be abandoned, like so many in rural Spain. But in a region where survival has long depended on nature, there is still a deep connection to the environment, and many locals are focused on conserving what they've inherited. When Díaz Ferreiro first started growing grapes, some of her neighbours would describe the ways they pruned each plant in their vineyards.\nAt the time, she couldn't imagine anyone having such an intimate understanding of individual vines, but now she has become one of those people. \"I don’t know how to explain it, but it is something that you just have to feel,\" she said. \"We are in contact with the earth, the plants and everything else around us. I’m part of this landscape.\"\n--- \nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

But where this ancient settlement faces west, towards the small island of St Kirik, Sozopol throws welcoming arms around its natural harbour, offering sailors a safe port of call along this choppy stretch of the Black Sea coast.\nSozopol is now one of Bulgaria's most popular resorts, with medieval churches and wide sandy beaches. But it is that embracing harbour that first brought travelling ancient Greeks to Sozopol more than 2,500 years ago. The town's modern name derives from the Greek for \"City of Salvation\", but in the first millennium BC it was called Apollonia Pontica (Apollo of the Black Sea) after the great Greek Sun god Apollo. Apollonia Pontica grew into a bustling port city, complete with a substantial temple to Apollo, and a 13m-tall bronze image of the god. As far as ancient Greek statues go, this was second in size only to the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Famous throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, Apollonia Pontica's giant statue featured on the city's coins and was eventually stolen by the Romans.\nOn a sunny, early spring day, it can be hard to imagine the dangers of sailing the Black Sea. But for both ancient and modern seafarers, this area can be treacherous, says Nayden Prahov, director of the Sozopol-based Centre for Underwater Archaeology. \"It's a risky sailing route, because of the southern winds on the Black Sea,\" Prahov tells me when I meet him on his dive boat Hristina, anchored among the blue and white fishing boats that line the harbour. \"This is the first safe harbour between the Bosphorus and the Balkan Mountains.\"\nPrahov explains that back in Antiquity, the entrance into the port was through a narrow opening at the northern end, now closed off by a breakwater. This would not have been easy to navigate; but once inside, the ships were safe, sheltered between the peninsula and St Kirik Island. \"This is the reason that the symbol of Apollonia Pontica is the anchor,\" Prahov adds with a smile.\nThe result is a thick layer of what was once rubbish – mostly thousands of pieces of broken pottery, from utilitarian jars to finely-painted drinking cups – but is now an invaluable source of information and evidence about one of the greatest ports on the ancient Black Sea.\nApollonia Pontica was founded by Greeks from Miletus, now in western Turkey, in 610BC. They were pioneers in a vast movement of people and ideas, a process described by some as \"Greek colonisation\" that lasted from the 8th to the 6th Century BC and saw dozens if not hundreds of settlements established around the Mediterranean and the Black Sea – as far west as southern Spain and as far east as Georgia.\nApollonia Pontica was one of the first such colonies on the Black Sea. The safety of its port played a central part in transforming the sea once known to the Greeks as the Pontos Axeinos, or the \"Inhospitable Sea\", into the Pontos Euxeinos, or \"Hospitable\" one. But the Greeks did not arrive in a deserted land. This part of the world was home to the Thracians, a powerful, confident civilisation. And the trade between the local population and the Greek settlers was at the heart of the city's growth and prosperity: in exchange for grain, salt, timber and copper ore from the local mines, the Greeks brought sought-after produce from the Mediterranean, in particular olive oil and wine. During the excavations, local archaeologists have even found a glass perfume bottle from the Roman period with oily perfume still intact inside.\nYou don't have to look far to find that Mediterranean influence still alive and well among the cobbled streets and seafront tavernas of Sozopol today.

Remarkably, along with other Black Sea fishing villages that trace their origin back to Greek colonies, Sozopol remained majority Greek-speaking well into the early 20th Century, until population exchanges across the Balkans saw most of the town's ethnic Greeks abandon their homes and move to Greece itself.\nSome, however, remained, as Aspasia Porozhanova confirms when I sit down with her outside the Fishermen's Association clubhouse. As the Sun sets over the harbour, Porozhanova is at pains to point out that all Sozopolitans are proud Bulgarians, but that a small number of families are also determinedly hanging on to their Greek heritage. \"It's difficult to answer, 'Who are we?' or 'How long have we been here?'

The South Nahanni is a rare example of an antecedent river.", "He's survived adventures all over the globe – sometimes, barely. Here are his top outdoor escapes in his homeland of Canada, from dogsledding in Inuvik to hot tent camping in Temagami.\nFrom the sweeping prairies and lush forests of the Rocky Mountains to the crystalline glacial lakes and turquoise splendour of the Northwest Pacific Ocean, Canada has become a world-renowned symbol of nature, unspoilt beauty and brutality. Its frigid winters, harsh terrains, often aggressive wildlife and vast expanses of untouched land can make embarking into the Canadian wild feel like taking a leap of faith into the great, moody unknown.\nFew have understood and experienced this duality better than Ontario native Les Stroud, who has built a 30-year career teaching people how to both survive and enjoy Canada's wilderness. \"We have done our damage,\" he admits. \"But we are blessed with areas that are still pristine. We offer the kind of wilderness experience that has been dreamed about since the days of Charles Dickens.\"\nStroud, in many ways, is \"the\" expert survivor. His TV series, Survivorman, which aired from 2001 to 2016, ushered in a generation of similarly themed reality shows, documentaries and, most recently, TikTok influencers, by finessing the art of both experiencing survival and espousing it to a broader public.\nBut \"survivor\" is a term with which Stroud has an uneasy relationship.\n\"I'm an outdoor adventurer,\" he affirms. \"Survival sucks – you don't ever want to have to do survival. It's like knowing first aid. Ultimately, I'm all about connecting to nature.\"\nHere are Stroud's top five Canadian outdoor adventures.\nStraddling the border between the Yukon and Northwest Territories, the 560km South Nahanni River is an open-air gallery of glorious Canadian landscapes, from the giant Virginia Falls to its Grand Canyons; the Rabbitkettle Hotsprings to 350,000-year-old caves. With its abundance of geological treasures, the River's National Park Reserve was one of the first four Natural Heritage Sites listed by Unesco almost 40 years ago.\n\"It's the most epic canoe trip anyone can do,\" Stroud says. \"Every corner of the river is breathtaking. You keep thinking you're not going to see anything better than what you just saw, and you just do.\" \nPlanning a trip to the South Nahanni isn't \"the cheapest outdoor adventure,\" Stroud warns. \"But it's a big box to check off… a basic skill set will get you down the river, and you can paddle on your own. The companies on the river are top-level.\" \nNature in Canada is deeply intertwined with First Nations folklore; the South Nahanni is no exception. Purportedly dwelling along the riverbanks is a mythical wolf, the \"Waheela\", who was blamed for a spate of murders in the early 1900s.\nStroud may not have actually ever seen the beast, but he's flirted with other wildlife dangers.\n\"When I was a guide there, I was laying out one of the nights,\" he recounts. \"I woke up in the morning and there were wolf tracks all around where I'd been sleeping. You can tell they were sniffing my head while I was asleep.\"\nWebsite: https://nahanni.com/river/nahanni-river/Instagram: @canadianriverexpeditions\nFor those more adept at paddling, Stroud recommends a trip to British Columbia's Pacific coast.\nOn the north-eastern side of Vancouver Island, Telegraph Cove is a hamlet of multi-coloured wooden cabins, and the economy relies heavily on sea sports like kayaking.\n\"There's an added layer of skill set here,\" Stroud says. \"You need to know about the tidal currents, which can be very dangerous.\"\nBut intrepid, agile kayakers will find their efforts rewarded when visiting this Pacific coastal village. \"It's paradise,\" Stroud says. \"There are bald eagles, you see yourself kayaking past orcas and whales.\"\nEven a skilled adventurer like Stroud warns against being too dauntless, especially when encountering wildlife.\n\"I had my three-year-old son in front of me, when we saw a sea lion and we ended up getting close to it,\" he recalls. \"Sea lions are incredibly aggressive, and it made a beeline for us. I tried to turn around while the monster was coming at us in the water, until we got to the shore and we saw it was going back and forth, looking at us like it was mad.\"\n\"We pushed the envelope that time,\" he says.\nThe line between pleasure and pain is often a fine one – and \"hot tent winter camping\" proves it.\n\"Done correctly, it's one of the most beautiful experiences you'll ever have in your life,\" Stroud says. \"But done poorly, it's one of the most miserable.\"\nGoing hot tent camping means fully immersing yourself in the harshest of winter conditions.\n\"You pull a small sled behind you, on snowshoes, bringing a canvas-wall tent and a small stove, and hiking through the wilderness,\" he says. \"It requires going with a company that knows what it's doing.\"\nThe practice had long been overlooked by those seeking more comfortable outdoor adventures – in part because of widespread aversion to the cold and winter blizzards – but it is growing increasingly popular. \nOut of all the places to experience the adventure, Stroud recommends visiting the Temagami municipality in Ontario. \"It's stunningly beautiful to be in the middle of the Temagami wilderness,\" he says. \"It's [like] Algonquin Park, but more beautiful and without the people.\" \nWhile hot tent winter camping requires careful planning to ensure good ventilation and a safe handling of the stove, it offers an unbeatable chance to experience the magnificence of a Canadian winter.\n\"I remember sitting up at night at 20:00, with -40C, in our tent in a T-shirt playing cards,\" Stroud reminisces.\nCanada's best outdoor adventures don't have to involve getting your hands dirty or wet – they can even be enjoyed from safely behind the wheel. \nFor Stroud, one of the most pleasurable Canadian countryside experiences is driving through its vast expanses, then camping at one of its many provincial parks – indeed, 41% of the national territory belongs to the crown and is open to the public.\nBoondocking – or camping outside of designated campgrounds without amenities – often gets a bad rap due to its range of environmental and safety concerns. \nBut things are different in Canada, says Stroud: \"It's far safer here.

{"id": 476, "question": "What is the name of the new long-distance hiking route in Wadi Rum?", "answer": ["The Wadi Rum Trail"], "doc": ["It was also here, after years of careful scouting by a group of Bedouin and British friends, that a brand-new long-distance hiking route was unveiled in February 2023: The Wadi Rum Trail.", "“We hope it gives Wadi Rum the long-distance hiking trail it has long deserved, one that centers squarely on this region alone and that we believe step for step, kilometer for kilometer, shows the absolute best of not just its well-known, heavily visited tourism heartlands, but the more remote, little-trodden wilderness in its hinterlands, too,” Hoffler said.", "The Wadi Rum Trail is a new long-distance hiking trail in southern Jordan and the sister project of Egypt's award-winning tourism initiatives the Sinai Trail and Red Sea Mountain Trail.", "“The Wadi Rum Trail is a natural path that serves visitors away from tourist routes,” said Sabbah Eid of the Anaza tribe, who oversaw scouting work on the trail. “It is a beautiful route and encourages and supports the local people in Wadi Rum.", "But these corners of the Wadi Rum are still pretty unknown to the most. It would be amazing to connect further and collaborate on future potential projects. Could you give us the phone number of the guide to do the same route? Thank you very much for your wonderful article Your email address will not be published.", "It traces the stunning, extraterrestrial landscape featured in films like Star Wars and Dune, while helping to preserve traditional Bedouin culture.\nMy Bedouin guide Abdallah led the way up and into the crags of Jebel Umm Ishrin (1,753m), the sheer, eastern wall of Jordan's most spectacular valley: Wadi Rum. Though it's considered one of the world's most breathtaking desert landscapes today, few outsiders had ever heard of Wadi Rum in 1917 when British archaeologist and writer TE Lawrence travelled through, describing this eastern wall as \"one massive rampart of redness\".\nForty-five years later, his journey inspired the film Lawrence of Arabia, which effectively introduced Wadi Rum to the outside world.\nLong before Lawrence, local Bedouin scrambled to dizzying heights on these cliffs, blazing vertiginous paths to needle the mountains' narrowest gaps, reaching their innermost fissures and skirting their dome-capped summits on the hunt for ibex.\nAs Abdallah and I followed in their footsteps, clambering up the cleft of Umm Ejil (also known as Rakhabat Canyon), the passage narrowed and rock walls popped with weathered niches and delicate natural columns, as if marking the approach to an ancient shrine. Panting, I dropped to a black sandstone bench to rest beside Abdallah. We were deep in the heart of Jebel Umm Ishrin, engulfed in its silence, until a human-like whistle suddenly broke the quiet. I craned my neck to scan the surrounding cliffs. Such high, hidden reaches have long been considered the hideouts of magical jinn (genies).\nAbdallah smiled: a starling, he explained. Their two-part whistle is a familiar sound in the surrounding Hisma plateau.\nOf the area's hundreds of miles of red-sand desert, the bulk of which stretches beyond the Saudi border, it's Jordan's fortuitous sliver that is by far the best known. It's this stretch, centred on the Unesco-inscribed Wadi Rum Protected Area, that a bewitched Lawrence described as \"magically haunted\" and \"vast and echoing and God-like\". In recent decades, this extraterrestrial terrain has served as the backdrop of numerous blockbuster films, including Prometheus (2012), The Martian (2015), Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) and Dune (2021 and 2024).\nIt was also here, after years of careful scouting by a group of Bedouin and British friends, that a brand-new long-distance hiking route was unveiled in February 2023: The Wadi Rum Trail. This 10-day, clockwise circuit twists 120km from Jebel Umm Ishrin, encompassing the best of Wadi Rum's dreamlike landscapes, venturing far beyond the well-trodden 4x4 paths and into the heart of the Protected Area. As one of the trail's co-creators, Ben Hoffler, explained, it's a rich amalgam of Bedouin trails: \"Among the pathways it links are walking tracks, shepherding tracks, camel tracks, hunting routes, smuggling routes [and] part of the old darb al-hajj (pilgrimage route) to Mecca.\"\nHoffler has spent more than a decade blazing mountain paths in the region, including Egypt's Sinai and Red Sea Mountain trails and the Bedouin Trail – a transcontinental 1,200km route linking Jordan to Upper Egypt. Still, for Hoffler, there's a distinct and enduring allure to Wadi Rum. \"The mountains tower up and soar up in a way that has a grandeur that I haven't seen in other parts of the Hisma plateau. [Wadi Rum] also cradles a Bedouin culture that remains in many ways more traditional than what you'll find in the Saudi Arabian parts of the Hisma… It has a special feeling.\"\nLike the ingenious Nabatean civilisation that built Petra many centuries before them, the Zalabieh (the most prominent Bedouin community within the Protected Area today) were drawn to Wadi Rum by the perennial springs that trickle at the base of Jebel Rum – the majestic massif that towers over the valley just opposite Jebel Umm Ishrin. Sprouting with wild mint thickets, the rock walls around the springs are adorned with ancient Thamudic and Greek inscriptions along with several distinctly Nabatean shrines.\nYet, until only a few generations ago, the Bedouin village located at the base of Jebel Rum was little more than a huddle of goat-hair tents. Thanks to government efforts since the 1930s, the majority of the Bedouin here (as elsewhere in Jordan) have now permanently settled, with SUVs effectively replacing camels and 4x4 tourism driving the local economy. Most such tours head south, following the valley along a virtual highway of tracks.\nBy contrast, the Wadi Rum Trail climbs east into the twisting bowels of the mountains, losing the crowds from the start. Ten days later, it ends where it began, with increasingly hair-raising abseils down the face of Jebel Rum landing you back at the springs.\nClimber and adventurer Tony Howard was first drawn to Wadi Rum in the 1980s and has since played a pivotal role in putting Wadi Rum on the tourism map. In exploring and publishing the region's first climbing routes, he struck up lasting friendships with Zalabieh members and was deeply impressed by their hospitality and knowledge of the steep terrain.\nAfter Howard and Hoffler hiked the Sinai Trail together in Egypt, the two began collaborating with Howard's friends in Wadi Rum – among them Zalabieh elders – to create a similar long-distance trail in Jordan.\nLike Hoffler's other projects in Egypt, the Wadi Rum Trail was designed with both hikers and locals in mind. Though tackling the trail on your own is permitted, the creators are convinced that the most rewarding experience is to be had in the company of Bedouin guides.\n\"The Wadi Rum Trail first and foremost pays homage to the Bedouin of Wadi Rum,\" said Howard. \"They know the area, its flora and fauna intimately from ancestral knowledge – and they are always good company and good fun!\"\nMore like this: • The King's Highway: The road that reveals Jordan's history • 373 miles of secret treasures • Jordan's beautiful, cursed landscape\n\"There are many hearts in this path,\" said one such Zalabieh elder, Sabbah Eid. \"[It's a] beautiful experience with nature and the life of the Bedouin, far from communication and modern life… it gives a special spirit to the place – complete calm.\" As Eid explained, much of the impetus for the trail's creation was to support the Bedouin community, connecting \"a new generation of young people to work on this path – instead of working with tours on cars\".\nHoffler believes that Bedouin-led efforts like the Wadi Rum Trail can help preserve the Bedouin's natural environment and cultural heritage. \"If history have shown us anything it's that the Bedouin known how to live sustainably in the wilderness,\" Hoffler said.\nWhile hiking the complete trail takes 10 days, those short on time can tackle it in bite-sized chunks, as I opted to do, beginning with the first of the route's six sections: the traverse of Umm Ejil. This leads to the spectacular dunes of Wadi Umm Ishrin, where the surrounding cliffs hide a trove of petroglyphs and Nabatean and Thamudic inscriptions. Scrambling over another craggy rise, the sandy expanse of the Khor al-Ajram basin spread to the south. After threading the gorgeous Abu Khashaba Canyon, we scaled Jebel Birda (1,574m) and stood atop its enormous rock arch. The views from Birda's ridge encompass the greatest of Wadi Rum's sandstone massifs to the north, west and south.\nFrom here the trail leads east, leaving behind the camps and the sands of Wadi Rum's classic landscape to enter the desolate Tablelands, among the route's loneliest sections. It then arches south along an ancient camel trail, passing old burial grounds, further time-worn inscriptions and a valley dotted with traces of long-forgotten caravans.\nJordan's highest peak is the route's next landmark, located just 1km from the Saudi border: Umm ad-Dami (1,854m). The clouds burst with colour as I scrambled the final stretch to its stony summit. Salman, my young Bedouin guide for this stretch, explained that the peak's name is linked to an old Bedouin code of justice and honour. Blood feuds, known as damm (\"blood\") have long been resolved by way of this unwritten law. In Bedouin strongholds like Wadi Rum, this code still applies to this day, with tribal sheikhs still tasked as traditional jurists alongside – or in lieu of – civil authorities.\nLooking west from the summit to the burnt-orange bluffs, I wondered if the name could perhaps have come from their rusty tinge at this hour. A welcome breeze picked up as I admired the succession of ridges, towering over enormous waves of immaculate sand.

This 10-day, clockwise circuit twists 120km from Jebel Umm Ishrin, encompassing the best of Wadi Rum's dreamlike landscapes, venturing far beyond the well-trodden 4x4 paths and into the heart of the Protected Area. As one of the trail's co-creators, Ben Hoffler, explained, it's a rich amalgam of Bedouin trails: \"Among the pathways it links are walking tracks, shepherding tracks, camel tracks, hunting routes, smuggling routes [and] part of the old darb al-hajj (pilgrimage route) to Mecca.\"\nHoffler has spent more than a decade blazing mountain paths in the region, including Egypt's Sinai and Red Sea Mountain trails and the Bedouin Trail – a transcontinental 1,200km route linking Jordan to Upper Egypt. Still, for Hoffler, there's a distinct and enduring allure to Wadi Rum. \"The mountains tower up and soar up in a way that has a grandeur that I haven't seen in other parts of the Hisma plateau. [Wadi Rum] also cradles a Bedouin culture that remains in many ways more traditional than what you'll find in the Saudi Arabian parts of the Hisma… It has a special feeling.\"\nLike the ingenious Nabatean civilisation that built Petra many centuries before them, the Zalabieh (the most prominent Bedouin community within the Protected Area today) were drawn to Wadi Rum by the perennial springs that trickle at the base of Jebel Rum – the majestic massif that towers over the valley just opposite Jebel Umm Ishrin. Sprouting with wild mint thickets, the rock walls around the springs are adorned with ancient Thamudic and Greek inscriptions along with several distinctly Nabatean shrines.\nYet, until only a few generations ago, the Bedouin village located at the base of Jebel Rum was little more than a huddle of goat-hair tents. Thanks to government efforts since the 1930s, the majority of the Bedouin here (as elsewhere in Jordan) have now permanently settled, with SUVs effectively replacing camels and 4x4 tourism driving the local economy. Most such tours head south, following the valley along a virtual highway of tracks.\nBy contrast, the Wadi Rum Trail climbs east into the twisting bowels of the mountains, losing the crowds from the start.

In exploring and publishing the region's first climbing routes, he struck up lasting friendships with Zalabieh members and was deeply impressed by their hospitality and knowledge of the steep terrain.\nAfter Howard and Hoffler hiked the Sinai Trail together in Egypt, the two began collaborating with Howard's friends in Wadi Rum – among them Zalabieh elders – to create a similar long-distance trail in Jordan.\nLike Hoffler's other projects in Egypt, the Wadi Rum Trail was designed with both hikers and locals in mind. Though tackling the trail on your own is permitted, the creators are convinced that the most rewarding experience is to be had in the company of Bedouin guides.\n\"The Wadi Rum Trail first and foremost pays homage to the Bedouin of Wadi Rum,\" said Howard. \"They know the area, its flora and fauna intimately from ancestral knowledge – and they are always good company and good fun!\"\nMore like this: • The King's Highway: The road that reveals Jordan's history • 373 miles of secret treasures • Jordan's beautiful, cursed landscape\n\"There are many hearts in this path,\" said one such Zalabieh elder, Sabbah Eid. \"[It's a] beautiful experience with nature and the life of the Bedouin, far from communication and modern life… it gives a special spirit to the place – complete calm.\" As Eid explained, much of the impetus for the trail's creation was to support the Bedouin community, connecting \"a new generation of young people to work on this path – instead of working with tours on cars\".\nHoffler believes that Bedouin-led efforts like the Wadi Rum Trail can help preserve the Bedouin's natural environment and cultural heritage. \"If history have shown us anything it's that the Bedouin known how to live sustainably in the wilderness,\" Hoffler said.\nWhile hiking the complete trail takes 10 days, those short on time can tackle it in bite-sized chunks, as I opted to do, beginning with the first of the route's six sections: the traverse of Umm Ejil. This leads to the spectacular dunes of Wadi Umm Ishrin, where the surrounding cliffs hide a trove of petroglyphs and Nabatean and Thamudic inscriptions. Scrambling over another craggy rise, the sandy expanse of the Khor al-Ajram basin spread to the south. After threading the gorgeous Abu Khashaba Canyon, we scaled Jebel Birda (1,574m) and stood atop its enormous rock arch. The views from Birda's ridge encompass the greatest of Wadi Rum's sandstone massifs to the north, west and south.\nFrom here the trail leads east, leaving behind the camps and the sands of Wadi Rum's classic landscape to enter the desolate Tablelands, among the route's loneliest sections. It then arches south along an ancient camel trail, passing old burial grounds, further time-worn inscriptions and a valley dotted with traces of long-forgotten caravans.\nJordan's highest peak is the route's next landmark, located just 1km from the Saudi border: Umm ad-Dami (1,854m). The clouds burst with colour as I scrambled the final stretch to its stony summit. Salman, my young Bedouin guide for this stretch, explained that the peak's name is linked to an old Bedouin code of justice and honour. Blood feuds, known as damm (\"blood\") have long been resolved by way of this unwritten law. In Bedouin strongholds like Wadi Rum, this code still applies to this day, with tribal sheikhs still tasked as traditional jurists alongside – or in lieu of – civil authorities.\nLooking west from the summit to the burnt-orange bluffs, I wondered if the name could perhaps have come from their rusty tinge at this hour.

{"id": 479, "question": "How many different types of bread does Sardinia have according to Bazzu?", "answer": ["More than 1,200 different types of bread."], "doc": ["\"In Sardinia, we have more than 1,200 different types of bread,\" she added, \"and more than 200 different types of pasta – including filindeu, a sacred pasta that not everyone can make.", "Antico Forno della Casana makes some of the best focaccia in the region, according to food writer Laurel Evans. The bread with its signature dimples is a working-class staple that originated in Genoa. The local trick is to eat it upside down so the salt hits your tongue first and the rest of the flavors follow.", "It is also known as music bread because of the unique crackly noise it makes when it is broken and eaten. One of the oldest types of bread in the world, it embodies the wild nature and local people of Barbagia, the area from which it originates – austere yet inviting. As with any age-old product, the origin of pane carasau is shrouded in legend.", "My ancestors used honey, almonds, lemon, orange, semolina, barley and acorns.\" The island's bounty is staggering. Bazzu told me that in Oliena alone – a village of just 7,000 people in Sardinia’s central-eastern Nuoro province – 37 different almond varieties have been discovered.", "Caseificio Dicecca is a one-of-a-kind cheese bar, where cheesemaker Vito Dicecca created something unprecedented in this region: Apulian blue cheese. Over time, he’s developed 66 different types of blue cheese. He served Tucci focaccia with burrata, which Dicecca’s mother use to make for his school lunches.", "Simonetta Bazzu teaches tourists to make traditional Sardinian pasta, but her biggest dream is to help young Sardinians love their island and its traditions.\nThere I was, sitting on a plush white sofa in a centuries-old stone house in the abandoned, 400-year-old Sardinian village of Battista. The house was a traditional stazzu (a granite dwelling common to farmers and shepherds in this north-eastern part of the island), and despite having stood empty for more than 40 years, a careful restoration made it feel as though time had stood still. There was a large stone fireplace, the original wood-burning cooking hearth, original stone flooring and a sleeping platform. Only the flat-screen TV served as a jarring reminder that you can sit in the past while staring at the present.\nTo get here, I'd followed narrow, tortuous roads perched above cavernous green valleys; a dramatic juxtaposition from the quaint cafes and colourful buildings of downtown Olbia 20km north, or the turquoise beaches and yachts in Porto Cervo further along that same curvaceous route. I saw no people along the drive but had been forced to stop abruptly at one point as dozens of sheep flooded the road, bells clanging wildly.\n\"That's normal here,\" said my glamorous hostess Simonetta Bazzu, looking every inch a young, blonde Sophia Loren as she welcomed me into her home. Reassuring, but so far little about my experience with her felt normal. Especially not the fact that she owns 11 rough-hewn, uninhabited stazzus that make up the oldest part of Battista, where many of her ancestors – and her father – were born. \nThe village became abandoned more than four decades ago when the last of its inhabitants – her 100-year-old grandfather, Salvatore and 95-year-old grandmother, Angelina – lived out the last 10 years of their life in Olbia to be close to modern conveniences not available anywhere near Battista, such as doctors and markets.\nIn a stunning feat of imagination and ingenuity, Bazzu has turned this tiny ghost town into a Sardinian culinary educational centre and pasta school through her brand, Vittoria Arimani, which she launched in 2019. Thanks to the careful restoration work of Bazzu’s father, who owns a construction company, three of Battista's abandoned stazzus have been converted into modern showpieces befitting Architectural Digest – an old goat barn turned into a wine cellar, a one-room stazzu into a pasta and bread museum, and the two-room stazzu, where Bazzu's great-great-grandparents once lived, into a pasta-making kitchen complete with an outdoor wood-burning oven and patio that could double as an upscale restaurant garden. \nBazzu's noble goal: to teach Sardinia's younger generation how to make the bread and pasta their ancestors made – for free – so the traditions can live on.\nLucky tourists like me are secondary beneficiaries of that vision, as Bazzu finances her work through the paid experiences she offers every day, year-round, inviting guests from all over the world to roll pasta on her gorgeous handmade kitchen table. Between the more tourist-driven months of May and October, she offers two classes a day – a lavish lunch or dinner with fruit and vegetables from her garden, baked goods, homemade cheese and wine and more history than one would expect to find in a traditional cooking school. \nSitting on the patio for lunch that day, I could hear birds singing and a lone dog barking in the distance. There are just five neighbours in the area, making the sounds of the past feel much louder than anything in the present.\nThat most certainly included the food, which Bazzu presented to me as a sort of historical dinner theatre, offering the foundational ingredients from her island in each course. Rose petals were strewn across a tree trunk used as a serving platter, and wedges of crusty bread were spread with homemade lemon marmalade and dusted with a powder she made from dried orange peel.\nInto tiny golden porcelain cups, she poured coffee made from acorns she boiled, roasted and ground. It was burnt and nutty in the most delicious way, and she told me her grandmothers drank this, along with coffee made from chickpeas and barley. \n\"In times of famine, we used what the land could give,\" she said. \"And before there were airplanes, it wasn’t easy to bring sugar, coffee, tobacco or chocolate to Sardinia. My ancestors used honey, almonds, lemon, orange, semolina, barley and acorns.\"\nThe island's bounty is staggering. Bazzu told me that in Oliena alone – a village of just 7,000 people in Sardinia’s central-eastern Nuoro province – 37 different almond varieties have been discovered.\n\"In Sardinia, we have more than 1,200 different types of bread,\" she added, \"and more than 200 different types of pasta – including filindeu, a sacred pasta that not everyone can make.\"\nBazzu learned to make filindeu and other ancient foods from living in small villages on different parts of the island over the last decade, studying bread and pasta making with the older matriarchs. I poured myself more coffee as I watched her crush walnuts from her home garden with a brick she found in the dirt. Soon, the nuts were whirring in a blender, along with water and Pecorino cheese, to finally be poured onto a bowl of Maccarones de ferrittu – a pasta from the Barbagia region in the centre of Sardinia named for the iron knitting needles from which they were traditionally shaped. They looked like doughy cigarettes after we rolled them by hand on the table her father made from an old tree.\nAs I brought a glass of her homemade wine to my lips, I asked why she built all this, and she began to cry.\n\"I love my island, but life in Sardinia is very difficult,\" she said. \"We are a beautiful island, but we are in the middle of the sea. In the winter, we have just two flights a day, and the boat is very expensive, so if we have wind, we have no boat and no flights. We have many problems. When I cry it's because it’s hard.\"\n\"Too many young people go to other cities for work,\" she added. \"I wanted to change the situation in Sardinia and show our history to the whole world.\"\nHer mission to inspire young Sardinians to connect with their heritage while educating outsiders about the value of supporting its gastronomic economy was initially met with a lack of understanding. \nMore like this:• The battle over Italy's eclectic, handbuilt village• Italy's classic pasta e patate (pasta and potatoes) dish• The snubbed Italian town that's now winning awards\nAfter earning a law degree in Milan and managing her father's construction company for 14 years, she says it was difficult for her father to understand why she would choose to make pasta instead of continuing to work with him. \"For my father, to make pasta and cheese was to live, not for a hobby or occupation,\" she said.\nBecause of this, Bazzu started with no money or support, catering to tourists who spoke English, which she did not know how to speak at the time.\n\"It was very, very difficult,” she said. \"My parents didn't help me when I started. People asked, 'why do you choose this work? Why do you make pasta?' Slowly, people started to understand my work and my mission with younger people in Sardinia. \nTo get the word out about her mission, she often chats to strangers on the street. As we strolled through the alleys of downtown Olbia one afternoon, she stopped a man wearing a chef's jacket as he was entering his apartment. He was stunned when he learned he could train with Bazzu for free. It's her hope that this kind of enthusiasm creates a ripple effect that will imbue younger Sardinians with pride in their heritage. She also hopes they can build on it by putting their own stamp on things, as Bazzu does.\n\"I am younger and love Chanel and disco, but I love to make pasta and cheese,\" she said. \"I love my tradition, but I am modern. God chose me to show the world that Sardinians are also part of the younger tradition.\"\nAfter many years, she's finally been recognised for the impact her work has had on her fellow islanders. In 2022 she was asked to appear on Stanley Tucci’s show, Searching for Italy – where she pulled a bubbling tray of zuppa cuato – a traditional Galluran dish of thin, crisp Sardinian flatbread layered with lamb broth, local cheese and wild mintfrom her wood-fired oven – while donning stilettos and a low-cut green floral dress with a thigh high slit that might make the island's numerous centenarians (and her ancestors) blush.\nWhen Tucci remarked that it resembled lasagna, she referred to it as \"Sardinian lasagna\" that doubles as a \"hidden soup\" because the broth is absorbed, giving the dish a remarkably rich flavour. \nNow a de facto spokesperson for Sardinia's culinary riches on international television, she has also been featured regularly in Sardinian newspapers L’Unione Sarda and La Nuova Sardegna. And while inspiring future generations and catering to the many tourists who have come through her kitchen over the last five years, you'd think the success would have gone to her head. But that's not Bazzu's style. She's only got her grandmothers to impress, and knows that wherever they are, they'd be proud to see her carrying on their legacy. Especially in stilettos. \n\"This isn’t an easy job, but it’s my happiness,\" she said. \"I live today, like my grandmothers yesterday. I have gratitude for my land, and just want people to know the real Sardinia.\"\n-- \nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}
{"id": 480, "question": "What is the name of the farm in Pomfret that became one of the most photographed places in the state?", "answer": ["Sleepy Hollow Farm"], "doc": ["It's no wonder then, that this unlikely farm has become known as one of \"the most photographed places in the state\". \"It's a beautiful spot. It's too bad it's been ruined for everybody,\" said Deborah Goodwin, the exhibits coordinator at Pomfret's Artistree Community Arts Center. \"[For] the past couple years it's been out of control.", "It’s one of the most photographed properties in Vermont — but it didn’t start out that way. Learn the history of Pomfret’s Sleepy Hollow Farm. By Ian Aldrich Sep 12 2022 Sleepy Hollow Farm in Pomfret, Vermont. 2023 Update.", "The reason: photos of an old farm in the most beautiful fall foliage setting that went viral. Named ‘Sleepy Hollow Farm,’ this enchanting property spans 115 hectares of private land. According to the information website newengland.com, the farm was owned by none other than Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry and his wife Billie Paulette Montgomery.", "Pomfret and Woodstock, Vermont jointly voted to revoke access to Cloudland Road from September 23 to October 15, which leads to Sleepy Hollow Farm, also known as the \"most photographed\" place in the state. One search for the location on Instagram will garner hundreds of thousands of postcard-worthy fall landscapes and scenery.", "Columns of cars lined up, and person after person climbed over the property gate and posed in front of the same background. This can be seen on Instagram. The backdrop of the farm and idyllic fall foliage is now considered one of the most photographed places in Vermont. Numerous photos of the farm and its surroundings flood social media channels.", "As hordes of photographers began descending on a small, rural community to capture its vibrant autumnal colours, local residents have been fighting back – and winning.\nTo enter the town of Pomfret, located in the US state of Vermont, is to be instantly struck by its bucolic beauty. From the north, Howe Hill Road winds downhill in a series of gentle curves, each sweep revealing verdant farm fields dotted with sheep, or swaths of forest in which the red and orange autumn leaves cling to boughs. At one home, a tree heavy with apples bends over a meticulously maintained stone wall, its slate top filled with decaying fruit. \nBut come early autumn, more than half of the cars driving through this 900-person town will sport out-of-state license plates, coming to abrupt stops on a road with a 45-mile-per-hour speed limit, blocking one of two lanes. The reason? To take a picture of a farm's silo against a backdrop of autumn leaves.\nWith a mere handful of businesses – a general mercantile store, an art centre with a gallery and a theatre and a few pick-your-own apple or pumpkin farms – Pomfret is generally a quiet, unassuming place. But in autumn as \"leaf-peepers\" from around the world descend on the region's rolling hills and fetching small towns to witness its kaleidoscopic foliage, that all changes.\nUntil recently, the number of leaf-peepers visiting Pomfret was more trickle than torrent. But ever since images of Sleepy Hollow Farm, a 115-acre private property set on a rustic road, began going viral on social media a few years ago, locals say things have gotten out of hand. A quick look on Instagram reveals thousands of images of the farm's winding earthen road lined by stately maple trees lit up in autumnal reds and jack-o-lantern oranges leading toward an elegant 1700s Cape Farmhouse on Cloudland Road. It's no wonder then, that this unlikely farm has become known as one of \"the most photographed places in the state\". \n\"It's a beautiful spot. It's too bad it's been ruined for everybody,\" said Deborah Goodwin, the exhibits coordinator at Pomfret's Artistree Community Arts Center. \"[For] the past couple years it's been out of control. Tour buses were just dumping... people out there.\"\nGoodwin says social media influencers would regularly climb over a gate plastered with \"No Trespassing\" signs, set up changing booths to accommodate their many costume swaps, get their \"city cars\" stuck on the narrow dirt road, and leave bodily waste by the roadside. \"It was bad,\" she recalled. \"The residents went to the [local government] and said, 'We can't have this anymore.'\" \nDuring the 2022 leaf-peeping season, law enforcement temporarily turned the road past Sleepy Hollow into a one-way thoroughfare. It wasn't enough to deter tourists from behaving badly. In 2023, local residents tried a different approach: crowdsourced funding.\nIn a plea on GoFundMe, a team of organisers wrote: \"[We have] experienced an unprecedented surge in Instagram and TikTok-fuelled tourist 'influencers'... [who] have damaged roads, had accidents, required towing out of ditches, trampled gardens, defecated on private property… and verbally assaulted residents.\" To date, the request has garnered 125 donations, and raised more than $22,058. \nAs a result, town officials voted to close the roads leading to the farm during the peak fall foliage season (23 September to 15 October) to non-residents, spurring the ire of travellers who had driven to the area in hopes of capturing a perfectly curated autumn photo. \n\"It's a hotel and amusement park,\" scoffed one Instagrammer with 153,000 followers. \"Bring all your friends and RVs.\" \nMost Pomfret residents stressed that they're not anti-tourist; they simply want people to treat their hometown with respect. Even more concerning than issues of private property, several mentioned, are safety concerns for the residents of Cloudland Road, as well as the tourists themselves.\nAccording to Windsor County Sheriff Ryan Palmer, \"This is not a road that's designed to have multiple vehicles on it. [In 2021 and 2022] there were lines of traffic parked up and down the roadway, and you couldn't get fire apparatus or an ambulance through. It was just overwhelming the infrastructure in the area.\" \nThings were different in the buzzy neighbouring town of Woodstock, where Cloudland Road ends. There, throngs of visitors dipped in and out of cute boutiques, their storefronts decorated with pots of chrysanthemums and warty winter squash. Outside Au Comptoir cocktail bar, patrons waiting for tables draped themselves over stone walls. On the town's sidewalks, people paused mid-step to capture scenic photographs of stately buildings erected by the Rockefellers. The town's eateries were jam-packed, too. At the Woodstock Inn & Resort – whose executive chef, Matthew McClure, is a seven-time James Beard Award semi-finalist – there was only enough room in the property's restaurants for those who were staying at the inn.    \nUnlike Pomfret, Woodstock is a town that thrives on tourism and is equipped to handle it. Lori Crowningshield, retail manager at The Vermont Flannel Co's flagship store on Elm Street, reported that 2023's shockingly rainy summer was \"really hard on everyone. We really, really need the tourists here.\"\nBut what's good for Woodstock isn't necessarily good for Pomfret. At a time when cities like Venice are so inundated with travellers that officials have imposed a tourist tax to visitors, and when trendy restaurants are banning influencers and their phones from dining, Pomfret is just one of many places around the world trying to curb overtourism and fight back against the hashtaggers – but it's come with a cost.\nAccording to Palmer, Pomfret's road closures aren't just time consuming for law enforcement to maintain; they're expensive too. Palmer guesses that Cloudland Road residents footed a bill upwards of $10,000 so officials could post road closure signs and enforce patrols – all of which inadvertently raised the town's profile as word got out. \nPalmer hopes that the Pomfret drama is a \"one-and-done\" deal. Residents have floated the idea of creating a reservation or ticketing system for visits to Sleepy Hollow to help manage the tourist rush in a more responsible way, but as far as he knows, that option isn't under serious consideration. In fact: feedback on the traffic pattern changes implemented in 2023 has been largely positive, leading to the Pomfret Selectboard's decision to implement similar road closures for the imminent 2024 foliage season.\n \"We enjoy having tourists here, it's a big part of the Vermont economy, and we want people to enjoy the natural beauty, visit the vendors and the shops, and drive around,\" he said. \"The big thing is having respect for people's homes and their property… Please come visit, just be respectful.\"\nThis is an updated article first published on 12 October 2023\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Just 140m away is the historic department store Rinascente. \"I love architecture. I think the Duomo is a is a great example,\" says Gasly. \"[It's so] beautiful and massive.", "F1 racer Pierre Gasly loves living in fashion-forward Milan. Here are his top weekend picks, from shopping in Quadrilatero della moda to walking his puppy in Parco Sempione.\nFor Pierre Gasly, a pilot for the BWT Alpine F1 team, everyday life is as fast-paced as a lap on the circuit.\n\"I've been doing Formula One for eight years now,\" says Gasly. \"I started racing when I was six; travelling the world since I was nine years old. I only know this life of being on the run all the time; being in airports and on planes.\"\nSo a great home base is especially important. That's why, in 2019, Gasly settled in Milan, Italy's stylish financial capital. \"I literally moved three months before winning the Italian Grand Prix,\" says Gasly. \"I didn't need to go to any airports, fly to any place. I just drove back home and then woke up on Monday morning in my bed as an F1 race winner. After all the emotions it really made me have this special attachment to the city itself and even to my apartment. I love this place.\"\nBut it's more than the sweet memory of victory that ties Gasly to edgy, contemporary Milan, a sprawling metropolis with splendid Gothic and Renaissance architecture and ancient Celtic roots. \"I'm a city guy,\" he says. \"I need to feel the action. Milan is a big city but not overcrowded, like Paris or London or New York. You can cross town in 20-25 minutes. Fashion is massive; I love fashion. You have two football teams; one amazing stadium. Whenever I feel like going out for dinner with my girlfriend you have so many different options and the food is very good quality; very pure, very healthy. It's just a combination of all my life pleasures in one place. I find it amazing to live here.\"\nIt certainly helps that Milan is also a huge Formula One city, due to its proximity to the Autodromo Nazionale Monza circuit, site of the Italian Grand Prix; a nine-minute train ride from Milano Centro in the medieval city of Monza. \"It's running in the people's DNA,\" says Gasly. \"Almost like a religion. [On race day], the atmosphere is very unique in Monza. When you have all these fans showing up, the grandstands are absolutely buzzing.\"\nHere are Gasly's favourite ways to experience a weekend in his home base of Milan.\nMilan can be overwhelming for first-time visitors, with a whopping 182sq km of museums, luxury boutiques and dazzling layers of architectural history from Etruscan ruins to contemporary Italian skyscrapers scattered throughout its 88 vibrant neighbourhoods. But when Gasly wants to show visitors his adopted hometown, he knows exactly where to go.\n\"I take them straight to the Duomo,\" he says. \"Though I've probably seen it 100 times, every time I still stand in front, amazed.\"\nThe Duomo di Milano cathedral, built in stages between 1386 and 1906, is the largest Gothic structure in Italy; topped by a bronze 18th-Century statue of the Madonnina (Virgin Mary) and surrounded by a sweeping piazza – a playground for street performers and pigeons. Adjacent to the piazza is the 19th-Century covered shopping gallery Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II; its ceiling a kaleidoscope of wrought iron and stained glass. Just 140m away is the historic department store Rinascente.\n\"I love architecture. I think the Duomo is a is a great example,\" says Gasly. \"[It's so] beautiful and massive. The Galleria, Rinascente, this whole area will take a big part of your afternoon. Obviously tourists go there, but even living here now for years I love going there and hanging out. Do a bit of shopping, stop for an aperitivo and just walk around. I find it really beautiful.\"\nGasly also brings friends to Navigli; a hip nightlife quarter cut through by two picturesque canals, dubbed the \"Venice of Milan\". \"[Navigli attracts] students who follow sports so it's not that easy for me to go there because I'll have people stopping me,\" he admits. \"But with a cap and sunglasses I love going there. You've got many little bars. Some pretty cool shops as well.\"\nWebsite: https://www.duomomilano.it/Address: P.za del Duomo, 20122 Milano Phone: +39 02 361 691Instagram: @duomodimilano\nGasly is a self-professed lover of fashion, so it's no surprise that he loves living in Italy's fashion mecca. \"[The Milanesi] love their suits,\" says Gasly. \"The first time I came here, I was with my family, and I told them, 'How come all these people look so beautiful?' Every single woman or man was so well-dressed. They put lot of effort in making sure that they look great. And I quite like it because it creates a standard; you've got to look after yourself if you want to fit in.\"\nMilan is teeming with designer shops and indie boutiques – Gasly often comes upon new designers \"just walking my dog down streets I usually don't go down\". But the speedster finds himself most often in the Quadrilatero della moda – Milan's fashion district – so-called because it forms the junction between four of Milan's most prestigious shopping streets. \"It's pedestrian streets so you can go walking through there and you have every single brand that you can think of,\" says Gasly. \"You have everything… like Via Montenapoleone with all the big brands, which are pretty nice.\"\nMilan offers multitudes of culinary experiences, from classic Milanese dishes like osso buco (braised veal shank) and risotto alla Milanese (risotto with saffron) to top-notch sushi, a recent local craze. Gasly loves Milan's culinary scene: \"I'm a foodie,\" he proclaims. \"Even though it doesn't really match with my work; I gotta be very strict with nutrition. I'm a pasta guy, though. One place I love bringing people is Osteria da Fortunata.\"\nOsteria da Fortunata serves southern Italian fare in the Brera neighbourhood. There's always a long queue, but Gasly is undeterred: \"It's the best pasta. You see them literally making it from the streets through the window. It doesn't look fancy; it's quite a small place, it's just wooden tables, but the food is incredible; definitely worth the 30- to 40-minute queue. I'm an F1 driver and I'm happily doing the queue to get my pasta.\" His hack? \"There's another location in Moscova with less queue.\"\nGasly's go-to cheat meal is gnocchi alla Sorrentina; Sorrento-style gnocchi smothered with tomato sauce, basil and melted mozzarella cheese. \"If I go for a cheat meal with my girlfriend, we'll take one carbonara, one gnocchi alla Sorrentina and then we are done for the day.\"\nGasly also likes Beefbar, a swanky steakhouse on Corsa Venezia in the lavish Portrait Milano Hotel. \"I was there last night,\" he says. \"It's a really cool location.

As these threats become more common, travellers will have to better understand not only when it's safe to visit after a disaster, but when it's sensible.

Though travellers were happy to return, many residents, who were still without power and running water, quickly found themselves resentful of tourists at a time when locals still lacked basic services.\n\"I think it [left] a bad taste in locals' mouths,\" explained Mikey Cordero, an activist and co-founder of the Defend Puerto Rico Media Collective. \"You're enjoying my island, you're enjoying my community, you're enjoying what the local people built… but at the end of the day, it doesn't trickle back down to us.\"\nWhile Cordero acknowledges that the situation wasn't so much the fault of the visitors themselves, he feels strongly that both government and guests should do a better job to ensure that their money actually goes towards helping the local community, especially after a disaster. This is a particularly sticky issue in the Caribbean where all-inclusive resorts and cruise ships make up much of the tourism landscape.

Experts believe that as the climate crisis intensifies, the intensity and frequency of these extreme floods, fires, hurricanes and tornadoes will only continue to increase.\n Many cities are already looking for ways to mitigate the impact of climate change-induced threats, from adding more green spaces to combat urban heatwaves to investing in flood prevention technology. As these threats become more common, travellers will have to better understand not only when it's safe to visit after a disaster, but when it's sensible. Here are some important questions visitors should ask themselves before booking a trip to a recovering destination.\nAfter Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, officials started welcoming visitors back to the island just three months after the storm. Though travellers were happy to return, many residents, who were still without power and running water, quickly found themselves resentful of tourists at a time when locals still lacked basic services.\n\"I think it [left] a bad taste in locals' mouths,\" explained Mikey Cordero, an activist and co-founder of the Defend Puerto Rico Media Collective. \"You're enjoying my island, you're enjoying my community, you're enjoying what the local people built… but at the end of the day, it doesn't trickle back down to us.\"\nWhile Cordero acknowledges that the situation wasn't so much the fault of the visitors themselves, he feels strongly that both government and guests should do a better job to ensure that their money actually goes towards helping the local community, especially after a disaster. This is a particularly sticky issue in the Caribbean where all-inclusive resorts and cruise ships make up much of the tourism landscape. Making a point to stay at locally run hotels, shop with local vendors and eat at locally owned restaurants can help in hard times by ensuring that your tourist dollars are going directly to the affected community rather than to large companies based elsewhere.\nAfter Hurricane Katrina tore through New Orleans in 2005, leaving almost 1,400 residents dead and countless homes demolished, a cottage industry of Katrina tours popped up around the city in the following weeks to show that devastation to visitors – a move that many locals found problematic. \"There were still boats up in trees and houses sitting on top of barges,\" recalls Jason Bradberry, who lived in the city both pre- and post-Katrina. \"It was insane.\"\nIn response to public outcry, city eventually banned tours of the Lower Ninth Ward, one of the areas most devastated by the storm. \"No one wants to be cleaning out the remnants of the home that they've owned for decades or that's been in their family for generations, and have a tour bus drive by,\" said Kelly Schultz, senior vice president of communications for the city's tourism bureau, New Orleans & Company, whose family also lost everything in the storm.\nHowever, the intense focus on the city after the storm did bring another type of tourist whose positive impact was deeply felt.\n\"Many of our visitors initially were what we call 'voluntourists', who came here because they wanted to help rebuild a church or school,\" Schultz explained. \"We had college kids come help clean out my family's house for their spring break. Like you could be on a beach… but you chose to come gut somebody's home, which is a physically and emotionally gruelling process.\"\nFor Schultz, tourism was also an important way to help keep the city's culture alive. She points to one of the campaigns the city ran when welcoming tourists back after the storm: \"Soul is Waterproof\", a nod to the importance of preserving the unique music, food and practices that make the city so special, as something that also helped to bolster residents' pride after the devastation.\nIt's important to keep in mind the devasting impact these events have on locals and to be respectful of the people still struggling to recover. Organisations like the Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity and local churches and other community organisations often offer volunteer opportunities for both locals and visitors alike in the wake of disasters, as they did during the flooding in Kentucky in 2022, Hurricane Ida in 2021 and during the rash of tornados that tore through the Midwestern US in 2023.\nIn 2023, wildfires burned through the island of Maui in Hawaii, leaving the historic community of Lāhainā particularly devastated. In response, the state's governor called for an evacuation of tourists as well as a temporary halt on incoming visitors, \"so that resources and attention could be focused on the residents who needed it the most at that time\", explained Ilihia Gionson, public affairs officer at the Hawaii Tourism Authority.\nThe moratorium on travel to the island lasted about a week before tourism was slowly phased back in. The key to success, however, was that the locals played a major role in the reopening. \"Our Department of Health did a rapid needs assessment,\" Gionson said. \"Just asking disaster survivors 'what is your most critical need right now?' More than a third of respondents listed either financial stability or housing stability or some combination of that. Understanding that… there were about 60,000 jobs powered by visitor spending, it was clear that we needed to recover travel demand to the island of Maui.\"\nOfficials also made sure that when visitors were allowed back on the island, they were respectful of those still struggling to restart their lives, by making devastated neighbourhoods off limits to tourists. Instead, visitors were encouraged to support the community in other ways, and though visitor numbers are still in recovery, many people rose to the challenge.\nThe clear communication and locals-first approach put forth by the island's leadership was reflected back by visitors. \"In Maui's hour of need, the outpouring of aloha from around the world… whether it was monetary donations or offers of expertise or just prayers and good wishes. It was really heartwarming to see,\" said Gionson.\nWhile Gionson acknowledges that there's no easy answer of when places should start welcoming visitors after a disaster, he feels there are some clear guidelines that both travellers and destinations should follow. Top of mind is honest and transparent communication about the impact of the disaster from officials and respectful behaviour to affected residents from visitors. But perhaps more important than that, is that everyone does their part to make sure that the reopening of tourism supports the community at large.\n\"Tourism is an important piece of any community's recovery post-disaster, but you cannot let the economic activity lead everything,\" he said. \"You have real people who experienced the real trauma, who have different needs for their recovery. Restoring the economic activity for an area is one factor to consider, but it cannot be the only factor. You cannot let the economic recovery outpace the people recovery.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Waterlog was a watershed. Deakin led people to water and started a wild-swimming renaissance in the United Kingdom.", "The film stated that he was the source for the voice of the swimmer in Alice Oswald's 48-page poem Dart, about the River Dart in Devon.[6] Deakin's book Wildwood appeared posthumously in 2007.

And as this year marks 25 years since Deakin's ground-breaking book Waterlog: A Swimmer's Journey Through Britain, which arguably launched Britain's wild swimming movement by embracing the outdoors, encouraging the \"right to swim\" and arguing that \"natural water has always held the magical power to cure\", I wanted to journey the length of this waterway most Brits haven’t heard of with a dip, kayak and pedal about to unearth its allure.\nDeakin lived for 26 years in a 16th-Century farmhouse in the village of Mellis, four miles south of the Waveney, where he would swim in its moat. His regular wild dip sparked the idea of 36 swim adventures in places across Britain. Breaststroke inspired pen stroke and his cult classic emerged. In his three dozen plunges for Waterlog, he took in the Isles of Scilly with a snorkel and submersions in ice-cold tarns in Wales. But the Waveney was his favourite river and he would return to it time and again, devoting much of the chapter Extinctions to the waterway.\nThe Waveney was a \"secret river\" he wrote, \"by turns lazy and agile, dashing over shallow beds of golden gravel, then suddenly quiet, dignified and deep… With its secret pools and occasional sandy beaches, the Waveney is full of swimming holes, diving stages improvised from wooden pallets, dangling ropes and upturned canoes pulled up on the bank.\"\nDeakin often biked to many of his wild swimming destinations. \"The quality of cycling is akin to swimming,\" he described in Waterlog. \"I enjoy the gliding, swooping motion of the bike as I enjoy the grace of swimming.\"\nDeakin canoed the Waveney, too. He produced a radio documentary for the BBC on paddling the river from its source at Redgrave and Lopham Fen via Hoxne to the Geldeston Locks in a vessel named Cigarette.\nThe Waveney meanders along 59 miles of the Norfolk-Suffolk border in East Anglia before slipping into the River Yare and nosediving to the sea at Great Yarmouth. Along its willow tree-shaded watery kinks are an award-winning vineyard, an award-winning cheese dairy, craft breweries and indie cafes. Otters, kingfishers, endangered lapwings and water voles call the river home.\nDrainage mills, which once emptied the marshes of water for crops and cattle, remain upright, like sentinels. In winter, an elusive mantle hovers over the gloam with ghost-white mills looming large; reeds stiffen with frost. In spring, pussy willow seed fluff settles on the river like the softest of snow. And in summer, birds chatter and hedges swell with wild blooms.\nThe Waveney marks the southern extent of the Broads National Park, but it's all quite under-the-radar and deliciously underdeveloped, with barely a road alongside. My partner and I cycled as close to the river as possible to trace its route and uncover its secrets. From Diss, a Norfolk market town (handy with its railway station), we cycled 104 miles across four days over gently undulating river valley to the sea, staying at B&Bs along the way.\nFive miles west of Diss, Hoxne is a quaint village home to extraordinary stories. Edmund the Martyr, the 9th-Century king of East Anglia, and England's original patron saint, hid from enemy soldiers under Goldbrook Bridge. His golden spurs, reflected in the water, betrayed his position and he was given up by a passing wedding party. At the St Edmund's Cross memorial nearby, which commemorates the site of his capture and beheading at an oak tree, a gardener told us: \"Wedding folk don't use that bridge even now. They go around.\"\nEdmund's story is somewhat eclipsed by that of the Hoxne discovery of 15,000 coins, the largest hoard of Roman gold and silver ever found in the UK.\nAfter a swift pint mulling treasure at the timbered Swan Inn, we pedalled down a lane fragrant with wild garlic to what is arguably the most beautiful mill house on the Waveney. Deakin thought so, too, as he mentions it as a highlight in his radio piece.\nJust south of the town of Harleston sits Shotford Bridge. Beneath, there's a popular swimming spot that's looked after by The River Waveney Trust. \"The [wild swimming] movement highlights that people do want to swim in rivers and the water quality should be good enough for everybody to swim,\" said trust director Martha Meek.\nAfter a swim in the cool river shaded by willow branches drooping into the water and glancing red dragonflies and damselflies in sapphire blue darting about, we refreshed at The Cap, a craft brew pub in Harleston, for a pint of Ampersand's Bidon pale ale and a summery Basil Blush with raspberry.\nWe then cycled to the village of Mendham, crossing the bridge spanning the river and water meadows in the early evening sun as cows munched the grass. We stayed at the pocket-friendly Sir Alfred Munnings Hotel. The pretty mill at Mendham (now a holiday let) straddling the river is the birthplace of Sir Alfred Munnings (1878-1959), known as England's finest painter of horses – some of whose early scenes depict life in the Waveney Valley.\nWe glimpsed more valley life the following morning: Wortwell village's large striking-white weatherboard watermill is first mentioned in the Domesday Book, William the Conqueror's land survey of England. And at Homersfield village, we soaked up the sun-dappled river scene from a small bridge. Built in 1869, it's the oldest concrete bridge in Britain and arcs a sluggish spot in the river. We swam here, too, in the water, drinking in the wildness and romance. Water voles plopped into the river, their loud splashes breaking the peace. Deakin himself had spotted water vole holes \"the size of tennis balls in the banks\" as he paddled in Cigarette.\nThe Waveney at Bungay balloons in an oxbow curl. (Hire a canoe at Outney Meadow Caravan Park to paddle the waters here, and perhaps see an otter.) In Waterlog, Deakin swims around a bend in the Waveney and encounters an otter \"sunning itself on a floating log near the reed-bed\". Bungay is an enigmatic place with indie shops and cafes (great lunches at Earsham Street) and a 12th-Century castle. Known for its association with a demonic Black Shuck hound (honoured with an annual festival), lace curtains twitched in 2023 when it was called the Satanist capital of Britain.\nEscaping any potential clutches of the legendary dog, we cycled north to Flint Vineyard. A glass of mineral-y, elderflower-y Bacchus Fumé primed us before we climbed Annis Hill for a glimpse of private Mettingham Castle. We revived on the smell and taste of Ethiopian coffee at Silo Café where beans roast in a soaring 1950s grain silo on the river at Wainford.\nThe caffeine powered us on to one of the Waveney's most enchanting scenes: the white weather-boarded Ellingham Mill that overlooks a river pool with drifting swans. From here, the rural Geldeston Road lured us east to another of the river's highlights – the Locks Inn – right on the water and known for its live music. Deakin ordered a pint here as he docked Cigarette at the locks.\nGeldeston's bigger neighbour, Beccles, sits high on a cliff above the Waveney, with its huge church commanding the town. At Northgate street, the curved lane is riven with alleys that slope down to the river. In bygone centuries, wherries (sail boats designed to navigate shallow water) plied up and down the river's navigable arm to Beccles transporting goods such as malt, corn and coal.\nMore like this: • The 5,000-year-old pathway that's Britain's oldest road • The US's little-known 'Ellis Island of the West' • The Mediterranean island where hikers stay for free\nAfter a night in the beamed 16th-Century Swan House, we organised a guided kayak tour to see more of the river via Hippersons Boat Yard. As our paddles chopped the silky water, our guide recounted stories of reed cutting; herring history; Norfolk and Suffolk rivalry; and the eel, carp and perch swimming beneath us.\nThe Waveney disappears into the marshes after Beccles. We didn't glimpse it again until beautiful Carlton Marshes Nature Reserve, 7.5 miles away. We explored the bird hides huddled in the reeds and looked out for booming bitterns, Chinese water deer and rare hovering marsh harriers.\nThe marshlands snuggle up to Oulton Broad, a spur of the Waveney via Oulton Dyke. We biked north to picturesque Somerleyton Hall & Gardens. Beyond, in Somerleyton village, a cylindrical monument honours the Hovercraft (invented in 1955) and its creator, Sir Christopher Cockerell. We parked our bikes at Somerleyton Cycles (which stores panniers) while we walked the dreamy, sun-drenched route by the water to the timber-framed, octagonal Herringfleet smock drainage mill, the last of its kind on the Broads.\nIt wasn't until we reached the Fisherman's Inn that we appreciated the past toil of the region's mills. From the pub garden, endless marsh and distant mills steamed in the glare of the sun. The river coiled about the flatlands shimmering like quicksilver.\nClose to the inn are the thick, gnarly stone walls of vast Burgh Castle raised on a cliff at the confluence of the Waveney and the Yare. It's one of the best-preserved Roman monuments in Britain and while the west wall has collapsed into the marshes giving the high-perched ruins a million-dollar view, what's so sobering is that although mud, tides and time have shaped this shifting coastal area, the area is little developed since 3rd-Century Roman soldiers defended the estuary.\nOur journey had indeed offered us an escape into an unhurried, wild and different world.

Bungay is an enigmatic place with indie shops and cafes (great lunches at Earsham Street) and a 12th-Century castle.", "Steeped in history, it played a central role in Roger Deakin's groundbreaking book Waterlog that kick-started Britain's wild swimming movement.\n\"The Waveney for me, as my local river, has always been a kind of escape route,\" the late naturalist and wild swimming enthusiast Roger Deakin once said in a BBC radio piece. \"It's a way into another world.\"\nThe Waveney is my local river, too. And as this year marks 25 years since Deakin's ground-breaking book Waterlog: A Swimmer's Journey Through Britain, which arguably launched Britain's wild swimming movement by embracing the outdoors, encouraging the \"right to swim\" and arguing that \"natural water has always held the magical power to cure\", I wanted to journey the length of this waterway most Brits haven’t heard of with a dip, kayak and pedal about to unearth its allure.\nDeakin lived for 26 years in a 16th-Century farmhouse in the village of Mellis, four miles south of the Waveney, where he would swim in its moat. His regular wild dip sparked the idea of 36 swim adventures in places across Britain. Breaststroke inspired pen stroke and his cult classic emerged. In his three dozen plunges for Waterlog, he took in the Isles of Scilly with a snorkel and submersions in ice-cold tarns in Wales. But the Waveney was his favourite river and he would return to it time and again, devoting much of the chapter Extinctions to the waterway.\nThe Waveney was a \"secret river\" he wrote, \"by turns lazy and agile, dashing over shallow beds of golden gravel, then suddenly quiet, dignified and deep… With its secret pools and occasional sandy beaches, the Waveney is full of swimming holes, diving stages improvised from wooden pallets, dangling ropes and upturned canoes pulled up on the bank.\"\nDeakin often biked to many of his wild swimming destinations. \"The quality of cycling is akin to swimming,\" he described in Waterlog. \"I enjoy the gliding, swooping motion of the bike as I enjoy the grace of swimming.\"\nDeakin canoed the Waveney, too. He produced a radio documentary for the BBC on paddling the river from its source at Redgrave and Lopham Fen via Hoxne to the Geldeston Locks in a vessel named Cigarette.\nThe Waveney meanders along 59 miles of the Norfolk-Suffolk border in East Anglia before slipping into the River Yare and nosediving to the sea at Great Yarmouth. Along its willow tree-shaded watery kinks are an award-winning vineyard, an award-winning cheese dairy, craft breweries and indie cafes. Otters, kingfishers, endangered lapwings and water voles call the river home.\nDrainage mills, which once emptied the marshes of water for crops and cattle, remain upright, like sentinels. In winter, an elusive mantle hovers over the gloam with ghost-white mills looming large; reeds stiffen with frost. In spring, pussy willow seed fluff settles on the river like the softest of snow. And in summer, birds chatter and hedges swell with wild blooms.\nThe Waveney marks the southern extent of the Broads National Park, but it's all quite under-the-radar and deliciously underdeveloped, with barely a road alongside. My partner and I cycled as close to the river as possible to trace its route and uncover its secrets. From Diss, a Norfolk market town (handy with its railway station), we cycled 104 miles across four days over gently undulating river valley to the sea, staying at B&Bs along the way.\nFive miles west of Diss, Hoxne is a quaint village home to extraordinary stories. Edmund the Martyr, the 9th-Century king of East Anglia, and England's original patron saint, hid from enemy soldiers under Goldbrook Bridge. His golden spurs, reflected in the water, betrayed his position and he was given up by a passing wedding party. At the St Edmund's Cross memorial nearby, which commemorates the site of his capture and beheading at an oak tree, a gardener told us: \"Wedding folk don't use that bridge even now. They go around.\"\nEdmund's story is somewhat eclipsed by that of the Hoxne discovery of 15,000 coins, the largest hoard of Roman gold and silver ever found in the UK.\nAfter a swift pint mulling treasure at the timbered Swan Inn, we pedalled down a lane fragrant with wild garlic to what is arguably the most beautiful mill house on the Waveney. Deakin thought so, too, as he mentions it as a highlight in his radio piece.\nJust south of the town of Harleston sits Shotford Bridge. Beneath, there's a popular swimming spot that's looked after by The River Waveney Trust. \"The [wild swimming] movement highlights that people do want to swim in rivers and the water quality should be good enough for everybody to swim,\" said trust director Martha Meek.\nAfter a swim in the cool river shaded by willow branches drooping into the water and glancing red dragonflies and damselflies in sapphire blue darting about, we refreshed at The Cap, a craft brew pub in Harleston, for a pint of Ampersand's Bidon pale ale and a summery Basil Blush with raspberry.\nWe then cycled to the village of Mendham, crossing the bridge spanning the river and water meadows in the early evening sun as cows munched the grass. We stayed at the pocket-friendly Sir Alfred Munnings Hotel. The pretty mill at Mendham (now a holiday let) straddling the river is the birthplace of Sir Alfred Munnings (1878-1959), known as England's finest painter of horses – some of whose early scenes depict life in the Waveney Valley.\nWe glimpsed more valley life the following morning: Wortwell village's large striking-white weatherboard watermill is first mentioned in the Domesday Book, William the Conqueror's land survey of England. And at Homersfield village, we soaked up the sun-dappled river scene from a small bridge. Built in 1869, it's the oldest concrete bridge in Britain and arcs a sluggish spot in the river. We swam here, too, in the water, drinking in the wildness and romance. Water voles plopped into the river, their loud splashes breaking the peace. Deakin himself had spotted water vole holes \"the size of tennis balls in the banks\" as he paddled in Cigarette.\nThe Waveney at Bungay balloons in an oxbow curl. (Hire a canoe at Outney Meadow Caravan Park to paddle the waters here, and perhaps see an otter.) In Waterlog, Deakin swims around a bend in the Waveney and encounters an otter \"sunning itself on a floating log near the reed-bed\". Bungay is an enigmatic place with indie shops and cafes (great lunches at Earsham Street) and a 12th-Century castle. Known for its association with a demonic Black Shuck hound (honoured with an annual festival), lace curtains twitched in 2023 when it was called the Satanist capital of Britain.\nEscaping any potential clutches of the legendary dog, we cycled north to Flint Vineyard. A glass of mineral-y, elderflower-y Bacchus Fumé primed us before we climbed Annis Hill for a glimpse of private Mettingham Castle. We revived on the smell and taste of Ethiopian coffee at Silo Café where beans roast in a soaring 1950s grain silo on the river at Wainford.\nThe caffeine powered us on to one of the Waveney's most enchanting scenes: the white weather-boarded Ellingham Mill that overlooks a river pool with drifting swans. From here, the rural Geldeston Road lured us east to another of the river's highlights – the Locks Inn – right on the water and known for its live music. Deakin ordered a pint here as he docked Cigarette at the locks.\nGeldeston's bigger neighbour, Beccles, sits high on a cliff above the Waveney, with its huge church commanding the town. At Northgate street, the curved lane is riven with alleys that slope down to the river. In bygone centuries, wherries (sail boats designed to navigate shallow water) plied up and down the river's navigable arm to Beccles transporting goods such as malt, corn and coal.\nMore like this: • The 5,000-year-old pathway that's Britain's oldest road • The US's little-known 'Ellis Island of the West' • The Mediterranean island where hikers stay for free\nAfter a night in the beamed 16th-Century Swan House, we organised a guided kayak tour to see more of the river via Hippersons Boat Yard. As our paddles chopped the silky water, our guide recounted stories of reed cutting; herring history; Norfolk and Suffolk rivalry; and the eel, carp and perch swimming beneath us.\nThe Waveney disappears into the marshes after Beccles. We didn't glimpse it again until beautiful Carlton Marshes Nature Reserve, 7.5 miles away. We explored the bird hides huddled in the reeds and looked out for booming bitterns, Chinese water deer and rare hovering marsh harriers.\nThe marshlands snuggle up to Oulton Broad, a spur of the Waveney via Oulton Dyke. We biked north to picturesque Somerleyton Hall & Gardens. Beyond, in Somerleyton village, a cylindrical monument honours the Hovercraft (invented in 1955) and its creator, Sir Christopher Cockerell. We parked our bikes at Somerleyton Cycles (which stores panniers) while we walked the dreamy, sun-drenched route by the water to the timber-framed, octagonal Herringfleet smock drainage mill, the last of its kind on the Broads.\nIt wasn't until we reached the Fisherman's Inn that we appreciated the past toil of the region's mills. From the pub garden, endless marsh and distant mills steamed in the glare of the sun. The river coiled about the flatlands shimmering like quicksilver.\nClose to the inn are the thick, gnarly stone walls of vast Burgh Castle raised on a cliff at the confluence of the Waveney and the Yare. It's one of the best-preserved Roman monuments in Britain and while the west wall has collapsed into the marshes giving the high-perched ruins a million-dollar view, what's so sobering is that although mud, tides and time have shaped this shifting coastal area, the area is little developed since 3rd-Century Roman soldiers defended the estuary.\nOur journey had indeed offered us an escape into an unhurried, wild and different world. Deakin would still recognise his river, I thought.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Here are her top BBQ joints in her hometown of Houston.\nFor Sloan Rinaldi, a fourth-generation Houstonian pitmaster, Texas barbecue is serious business.\n\"I have a passion for it, for sure,\" says Rinaldi, who first pursued barbecue as a career at the age of 50. \"Yeah; passion, or you're not doing it!\"\nRinaldi rose swiftly in the Texas barbecue circuit, smashing barriers as a female pitmaster in a male-dominated field. This year, at age 60, her profile skyrocketed when she made it to the Top three in the latest season of Netflix's Barbecue Showdown, winning challenge after challenge with her perfectly executed craft barbecue recipes, and most importantly, representing her state and beloved hometown. \"[I'm] very proud of Houston!\" she says. \"It's dynamic, diverse, booming. It offers something for everyone, really.\"\nAnd Houston barbecue? \"Overall, there are two kinds of Texas BBQ,\" explains Rinaldi. \"Old-school barbecue and craft barbecue, meaning that everything is elevated… You're sourcing the best protein, all of the ingredients that go into your sides, everything handcrafted from scratch.\" \nHouston barbecue, specifically, draws hugely from the city's multicultural makeup. \"We consider Louisiana to be more of East Texas,\" says Rinaldi. \"They have a Creole cuisine that definitely is in our roots and our culture as well. So in Houston, it's going to be a fusion. Our barbecue scene has become very diverse with Asian influences – Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Egyptian, Iranian – you name it. Truly, we have 30 incredible craft barbecue joints right now that you can go to any day of the week, and you would not be disappointed.\"\nHere are the winners of Rinaldi's Houston Barbecue Showdown.\n\"Brisket is the king of all barbecue and Texas is best at brisket,\" proclaims Rinaldi.\nOf the nine \"primal cuts\" of meat used in barbecue, brisket – beef breast meat smoked until fall-apart-tender – is undeniably elite. And Rinaldi's favourite comes from Truth Barbecue, an upscale joint in Houston's historic Heights Boulevard.\n\"It's run by Leo [Botello IV],\" she says. \"He's a young pitmaster; one of the most consistently good pitmasters I've ever come across.\"\nTruth Barbecue began its life as what Rinaldi calls a \"complete hole in the wall, dive on the side of the road\" in the town of Brenham, roughly halfway between Houston and Austin. \"[Now he's] opened up a joint on Heights Boulevard, which is a major location. It's been there since 2021 and every day there's a line around the building.\" \nAnd how's that brisket? \"It's very beefy; very rich and succulent,\" she says. \"Fat content is essential in rendering a melt-in-your-mouth bite of brisket. The salt and pepper rub is spot on. It's not too much of anything.\nRinaldi's respect for Truth Barbecue doesn't end at brisket; she calls it Houston's \"best all-around joint\", and home to its best desserts. \n\"Turkey, ribs, house-made sausage,\" she says. \"They do boudin at times; a Cajun sausage. They do limited sides, but they are all stellar. And Leo's mom makes a three-layer cake. You can take it home and eat it for three days. My favourite is the carrot cake. The best cakes in Texas barbecue.\"\nWebsite: https://truthbbq.com/Address: 110 S Heights Blvd, Houston, TX 77007Phone: +1 832 835 0001Instagram: @truth_bbq\nMeat is the star at any barbecue; but Rinaldi points out, \"It's one thing to have incredible meat. It takes it to another level when you have really amazing sides.\" \nSide dishes – from fried okra to baked beans to blackened, blistered greens – are the quiet heroes of any Texan barbecue showdown, rounding out the flamboyantly rich meat flavours with forkfuls of pure comfort.\n\"That's where the finesse and technique and skill come into play,\" says Rinaldi. \"Obviously, being a woman, they don't expect you to be able to do barbecue, number one. I can smoke meat but then obviously I can do killer sides. And I love that. It gives me a little bit of an advantage.\"\nRinaldi loves the sides at Feges, a craft barbecue joint with locations in the underground level of the Greenway Plaza high rise – \"All the office workers go there\" – and the thriving Houston suburb of Spring Branch: \"Upscale, so very nice aesthetic inside. You have a great visual on the pits.\" \nFeges is helmed by Erin and Patrick Feges, a culinary academy-trained husband-and-wife duo. \"They're doing amazing things, and their side selection is deep,\" says Rinaldi. \"Usually, a barbecue joint will have four, maybe five side selections. They, at times, will have 20 plus, and they're all stellar, a lot of finesse. They're doing spiced Moroccan carrots. They also do brussels sprouts. They're doing sweet potatoes. They do a hog fat cornbread. They're very creative, and they're killing it on sides.\" \nWebsite: https://fegesbbq.comAddress: 8217 Long Point Rd, Houston, TX 77055Phone: +1 346 319 5339Instagram: @fegesbbq\n\"For ribs, I'm going to go with Grant Pinkerton,\" says Rinaldi. \"He has a lot of other good proteins and sides as well, but I think his ribs are really stellar.\"\n \nPinkerton's Texas Pit Barbecue in Greater Heights serves upscale craft barbecue – the meat is prepared gluten-free – and is famous for its excellent whole hog, which has landed the joint on the Travel Channel and Food Network.\n\"He has ribs he does two ways,\" says Rinaldi. \"This is the only place in Texas that'll give you an option if you want sauce on them or not, because everything is sauce on the side in Texas. So you can get a dry rib rub, or you can get it wet. And my preference is dry, but both of them are stellar so you can't go wrong, even if you were to get it wet with sauce on them. It's incredible. It's a great smoke, great flavour. The rub is simple and great technique, so killer. Consistently good ribs.\" \nWebsite: http://www.pinkertonsbarbecue.com/Address: 1504 Airline Dr, Houston, TX 77009Phone: +1 713 802 2000Instagram: @pinkertonsbbq\nHouston's barbecue scene is constantly evolving, and Rinaldi has her eyes on the best new kids on the block. \"I'm gonna shout these guys out big time; Bar-A BBQ,\" she says. \nBar-A-BBQ – the A stands for Abercrombie – is run by brothers Caleb and Cooper Abercrombie in the rural northerly Houston suburb of Montgomery. \"They're two brothers in their 20s that basically gave everything up and went all in on their barbecue joint and they're just killing it,\" says Rinaldi. \"I think they'll be on the top 10 list very soon in Texas.\"\nBar-A-BBQ serves a vast array of proteins, from turkey to mammoth-sized dino ribs as well as fully loaded platters, but Rinaldi is partial to their breakfasts. \"We cruised in, we had their breakfast, which was an incredible scratch-made brisket biscuit with brisket gravy,\" she says. \"Oh my god, it was amazing.

{"id": 493, "question": "What is the name of the dish that is unique to New Mexico and features green chiles?", "answer": ["Green Chile Cheeseburger (GCCB)"], "doc": ["Dubbed the chile capital of the world, Hatch was my final stop on a road trip to discover a fascinating dish unique to New Mexico that features this cherished fruit-and-spice in one: the green chile cheeseburger – or GCCB as it’s known locally.", "It can be eaten by itself, or drizzled over anything you can imagine. Green chile is baked into New Mexico’s bones. But I didn’t really understand why. As a food journalist, I realized I had a basic question: What is New Mexico green chile? And why is it so big here?", "Add in some Hatch Green Chile and it will be one of the best quesos you've ever had. Seriously, these are so good it's hard to share. Spicy pulled pork, ooey gooey cheese, and crunchy chips. What's not to love? The Southern New Mexico State Fair is never complete without green chile asadero quesadillas.", "It’s then dried and powdered, to be used in sauces; this is the way most red chile in the state is consumed.

Chicken Salad is the perfect picnic food!", "If New Mexico could have one state food, it would be the green chile cheeseburger, with each restaurant, diner and roadhouse cafe claiming to have the ultimate version.\nIt was a scorching early August day in New Mexico and I was heading south on the I-25, up and over rolling desert hills skirting the mighty Rio Grande River under a sky of endless blue. My destination was Hatch: a tiny village in the river’s valley, 70 miles north of the Mexican border, where a distinct aroma of sizzling fresh green chiles laces the air come harvest time, which had just begun.\nWhen I arrived and got out of the car, I was hit by a smoky scent that I soon traced to the nearby Grajeda Hatch Chile Market, one of many brightly painted chile purveyors dotting Franklin Street, the village’s main road. Here, I stood and watched for a while, transfixed, at the prized local ingredient tumbling in rotisserie-style roasters over roaring gas flames. A deafeningly loud and hot spectacle, necessary to scorch and loosen the chile skin to bring out the flavour before they're peeled, chopped and then roasted or turned into sauces. \nDubbed the chile capital of the world, Hatch was my final stop on a road trip to discover a fascinating dish unique to New Mexico that features this cherished fruit-and-spice in one: the green chile cheeseburger – or GCCB as it’s known locally. Not your regular burger, it comes served big and juicy, with cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle and, of course, a generous helping of green chiles, which I enjoyed roasted inside a \"world famous\" Hatch GCCB at Sparky’s Burgers and BBQ, Hatch’s roadside haven of Americana and kitsch where I escaped the searing heat after a mosey around town.\nHatch green chiles are renowned for their distinct flavour and heat, thanks to the unique terroir of the fertile Rio Grande River valley where they grow. Although this type of chile is grown throughout New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, California and Mexico, only those grown in Hatch can use the name. It’s a special ingredient celebrated every August at the Hatch Chile Festival, which has been running for more than 50 years and attracts more than 30,000 people.\nNew Mexico green chiles are defined by their long, thin shape, measure anywhere between five and 12 inches, and vary in spice level from mild to extremely hot. Fresh chiles are green, while dried chiles and dried chile powder are red. Chiles were first grown by Pueblo and Hispanic communities throughout Santa Fe de Nuevo México 400 years ago. So woven into the local psyche, they’re even used to illustrate car licence plates, and whether you prefer green or red is the state question.\nAnd here's where their story gets interesting. The GCCB is widely thought to have originated in another haven of Americana, The Owl Bar & Café, located 100 miles north of Hatch in the tiny New Mexico town of San Antonio. Its location is key to its existence: The Owl Bar & Café is just a 30-minute drive from the Trinity Testing Site at the White Sands Missile Range. This is where the world’s first atomic bomb was detonated on 16 July 1945 as part of the Manhattan Project led by Robert Oppenheimer, the lead scientist behind Christopher Nolan’s 2023 multi-Oscar-winning film.\n\"When they arrived in town from their secret laboratory at Los Alamos two hours north of here, they were masquerading as prospectors,\" explained Janice Argabright, fourth-generation owner of The Owl Bar & Café, as she told me about the Manhattan Project scientists. We were huddled in a leather-clad booth next to a polished mahogany bar that originally came from Conrad Hilton's father's saloon and rooming house, which was also located in San Antonio. \"[The Hilton hotel-chain founder] grew up here and our families were friends,\" she added.\nThe Owl Bar started with her great-grandfather in the late 1930s. \"He had a mercantile store with little cabins that he would rent out,\" she said. He also had the only payphone in town, so these \"prospectors\" would come and do their work and make calls. \"They rented their rooms and when they asked for something to drink and eat, we started serving food.\"\nThis was when Argabright's grandfather returned from the Navy. He needed money, so he opened a little bar in the mercantile store. \"He was the one who started cooking,\" she said, \"beginning with hamburgers, adding cheese and serving them with green chile on a separate plate.\"\nThe day the dishwasher didn't turn up for work changed the course of New Mexico's culinary history. \"With no clean plates left, my grandfather put the green chiles in the burger. So that's how we came up with the green chile cheeseburger dish we know today – and The Owl Bar & Café was born.\"\nThe improvised creation quickly became a favourite dish among the prospectors, who would come by regularly for cold beers and a green chile cheeseburger fix. \"They loved our burgers,\" said Argabright. \nRegarding the name, several untrue stories exist, but Argabright tells me it was chosen simply as a matter of cost. \"A travelling signwriter passing through town, who charged by the letter, offered to paint a name on our shop window. It was my father's friend and grandfather who chose 'owl' because it was short!\" I noticed the entire bar area festooned with owls of all shapes and sizes, amid other paraphernalia including first responder badges galore. There were also hundreds of dollar bills pinned to the walls with little messages. \"All gifts and mementos from appreciative customers,\" said Argabright. \"Every year we count up the dollars and donate them to charity.\" \nAt that moment my Owl Burger arrived on a small round blue plate. It looked classic, simple and unpretentious in a flour bun filled with an exceptionally juicy handmade beef patty, slathered in the family's famed (and secret) roasted green chile sauce. It was topped with American cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and finished with mayonnaise and a raw onion ring. It was so succulent I quickly devoured it.\n\"We've not changed the recipe at all since we started in 1945. We grind the meat so it's fresh and use a mix of chiles from Hatch, which somedays they're mild and others hot, so it's always a surprise,\" said Argabright, adding, \"and I think what sets us apart is the consistency of the burger.\" \nNowadays, across New Mexico, many restaurants, diners and roadhouse cafes claim to make the best GCCB, some of which feature on the New Mexico Green Chile Cheeseburger Trail. Launched in 2009 by culinary expert Cheryl Alters Jamison, the route takes in 66 stand-out restaurants, drive-ins, diners, dives, joints, cafes, roadside stands and even bowling alleys – including the Owl Bar & Café.\nI visited several more on my road trip along the trail, including the Buckhorn Tavern up the road from The Owl Bar, dating to 1944. Here, it's all about the Buckhorn Burger, a towering, photogenic GCCB that was a 2009 winner in American celebrity chef Bobby Flay's Throwdown, which used to air on Food Network. It consists of a handmade burger topped with American cheese and a healthy dollop of chopped, roasted chiles balanced carefully on top of pickle slices, a generous helping of shredded lettuce and a big slice of tomato – a savvy construction for extra height. It was delicious, succulent and subtly spicy, too.\nAnother unique stop was the sprawling Mineshaft Tavern in Madrid – pronounced “Mad-rid” – a creative community of about 80 homes on the picturesque Turquoise Trail National Scenic Byway. Its MadChile Burger, winner of the 2013 Green Chile Cheeseburger Smackdown in Santa Fe, was an elevated, gourmet affair. There was a choice of meat, including wagyu from nearby Lone Mountain Ranch, served in a shiny brioche bun with aged Cheddar, chipotle Dijon mayonnaise, two types of Hatch chiles (one tempura battered and deep fried, others roasted) served with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and a whole deep fried Hatch chile on the side.\nMore like this:• The 'Depression Burger' of Route 66• Roujiamo: China's 2,200-year-old 'burger'• The ‘Indian burger’ McDonald’s can’t master \nOwner Lori Lindsey is now – along with her MadChile Burger – somewhat of a local celebrity, having been featured on Tastemade's Worth the Hype TV show, and by British celebrity chef Paul Hollywood in his Paul Goes to Hollywood series. \"What you have here is the best GCCB in New Mexico,\" said Lindsey, smiling. \"It’s worthy of its own restaurant we sell so many. It's the most popular thing on the menu. It's hard for the chile suppliers to keep up with our demand.\"\nI also discovered the GCCB voted the best in New Mexico for five straight years at the New Mexico State Fair at Oso Grill in Capitan, a friendly one-street town that's famous as the resting place of Smokey the Bear, the face of the US Forest Service in the Wildfire Prevention Campaign. The inviting restaurant, set in an old bank building, was packed when I visited on a Tuesday night. \"It’s even busier at lunchtime,\" said owner Brian Cleckler, \"when the queue snakes around the corner.\"\nThis came as no surprise; their winning burger was unique for many reasons, not least because it arrived in a shiny brioche bun branded artistically with the ancient sun symbol that features on the New Mexico state flag.\n\"We also treat the burger like a steak,\" Cleckler said. \"We season it 24 hours in advance, then we cook it on a flat grill so that way it stays juicy. Then I use two types of green chiles; a hot one from Hatch for the sauce, and an Anaheim variety when those from Hatch are out of season, which we cut into strips, batter and deep fry. Then we have our homemade chipotle ranch dressing. I'm not a salad person so there's no lettuce or tomato. It's all about the green chile, it's the star of our burger.” \nNeedless to say, it's Cleckler's award-winning GCCB that tops the bill on the menu here, one of my favourite spots on the Green Chile Cheeseburger Trail. Tucking in, I wondered if the Manhattan Project scientists were salad people, and how they liked their green chiles. Tempura battered and deep fried or roasted, mild or spicy, perhaps? Who knows, but whatever their preferences, there's no doubt that the south-western food trend they loved that was created in the bar that opened to serve them is a testament to New Mexico's spicy food obsession – and now mine. \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

So that's how we came up with the green chile cheeseburger dish we know today – and The Owl Bar & Café was born.\"\nThe improvised creation quickly became a favourite dish among the prospectors, who would come by regularly for cold beers and a green chile cheeseburger fix. \"They loved our burgers,\" said Argabright. \nRegarding the name, several untrue stories exist, but Argabright tells me it was chosen simply as a matter of cost. \"A travelling signwriter passing through town, who charged by the letter, offered to paint a name on our shop window. It was my father's friend and grandfather who chose 'owl' because it was short!\" I noticed the entire bar area festooned with owls of all shapes and sizes, amid other paraphernalia including first responder badges galore. There were also hundreds of dollar bills pinned to the walls with little messages. \"All gifts and mementos from appreciative customers,\" said Argabright. \"Every year we count up the dollars and donate them to charity.\" \nAt that moment my Owl Burger arrived on a small round blue plate. It looked classic, simple and unpretentious in a flour bun filled with an exceptionally juicy handmade beef patty, slathered in the family's famed (and secret) roasted green chile sauce. It was topped with American cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and finished with mayonnaise and a raw onion ring. It was so succulent I quickly devoured it.\n\"We've not changed the recipe at all since we started in 1945. We grind the meat so it's fresh and use a mix of chiles from Hatch, which somedays they're mild and others hot, so it's always a surprise,\" said Argabright, adding, \"and I think what sets us apart is the consistency of the burger.\" \nNowadays, across New Mexico, many restaurants, diners and roadhouse cafes claim to make the best GCCB, some of which feature on the New Mexico Green Chile Cheeseburger Trail. Launched in 2009 by culinary expert Cheryl Alters Jamison, the route takes in 66 stand-out restaurants, drive-ins, diners, dives, joints, cafes, roadside stands and even bowling alleys – including the Owl Bar & Café.\nI visited several more on my road trip along the trail, including the Buckhorn Tavern up the road from The Owl Bar, dating to 1944. Here, it's all about the Buckhorn Burger, a towering, photogenic GCCB that was a 2009 winner in American celebrity chef Bobby Flay's Throwdown, which used to air on Food Network. It consists of a handmade burger topped with American cheese and a healthy dollop of chopped, roasted chiles balanced carefully on top of pickle slices, a generous helping of shredded lettuce and a big slice of tomato – a savvy construction for extra height. It was delicious, succulent and subtly spicy, too.\nAnother unique stop was the sprawling Mineshaft Tavern in Madrid – pronounced “Mad-rid” – a creative community of about 80 homes on the picturesque Turquoise Trail National Scenic Byway. Its MadChile Burger, winner of the 2013 Green Chile Cheeseburger Smackdown in Santa Fe, was an elevated, gourmet affair. There was a choice of meat, including wagyu from nearby Lone Mountain Ranch, served in a shiny brioche bun with aged Cheddar, chipotle Dijon mayonnaise, two types of Hatch chiles (one tempura battered and deep fried, others roasted) served with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and a whole deep fried Hatch chile on the side.\nMore like this:• The 'Depression Burger' of Route 66• Roujiamo: China's 2,200-year-old 'burger'• The ‘Indian burger’ McDonald’s can’t master \nOwner Lori Lindsey is now – along with her MadChile Burger – somewhat of a local celebrity, having been featured on Tastemade's Worth the Hype TV show, and by British celebrity chef Paul Hollywood in his Paul Goes to Hollywood series. \"What you have here is the best GCCB in New Mexico,\" said Lindsey, smiling. \"It’s worthy of its own restaurant we sell so many. It's the most popular thing on the menu. It's hard for the chile suppliers to keep up with our demand.\"\nI also discovered the GCCB voted the best in New Mexico for five straight years at the New Mexico State Fair at Oso Grill in Capitan, a friendly one-street town that's famous as the resting place of Smokey the Bear, the face of the US Forest Service in the Wildfire Prevention Campaign. The inviting restaurant, set in an old bank building, was packed when I visited on a Tuesday night. \"It’s even busier at lunchtime,\" said owner Brian Cleckler, \"when the queue snakes around the corner.\"\nThis came as no surprise; their winning burger was unique for many reasons, not least because it arrived in a shiny brioche bun branded artistically with the ancient sun symbol that features on the New Mexico state flag.\n\"We also treat the burger like a steak,\" Cleckler said. \"We season it 24 hours in advance, then we cook it on a flat grill so that way it stays juicy. Then I use two types of green chiles; a hot one from Hatch for the sauce, and an Anaheim variety when those from Hatch are out of season, which we cut into strips, batter and deep fry. Then we have our homemade chipotle ranch dressing. I'm not a salad person so there's no lettuce or tomato. It's all about the green chile, it's the star of our burger.” \nNeedless to say, it's Cleckler's award-winning GCCB that tops the bill on the menu here, one of my favourite spots on the Green Chile Cheeseburger Trail. Tucking in, I wondered if the Manhattan Project scientists were salad people, and how they liked their green chiles. Tempura battered and deep fried or roasted, mild or spicy, perhaps? Who knows, but whatever their preferences, there's no doubt that the south-western food trend they loved that was created in the bar that opened to serve them is a testament to New Mexico's spicy food obsession – and now mine. \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

In August 2015, for the first time, the power station generated all the electricity on the island for four hours and it made history in 2023 when it became the only island in the world to operate solely on wind and water power for 24 consecutive days, saving 13,708 tons of CO2 emissions and 4,509 tons of diesel. \nBut the wind turbines are spinning less and less in the face of climate change.\n\"Our production was lower in 2023 because we had a very long summer, with high temperatures and less wind. During September and October, we have a period known as the 'calms of September' – a time of calm seas, pleasant temperatures and little wind. Last year, they lasted almost until January,\" said Morales. \"That's why we are working on implementing other energy sources, such as photovoltaics.\"\nThis innovative island wants to be the first Spanish destination to achieve net zero emissions. \"We're developing a climate action plan,\" Suárez told me. \"The aim is to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030, and achieve zero emissions by 2050.\"\nThese are big ambitions for such a small isle, but its achievements in sustainability are being recognised.

The Virgen de los Reyes, the island's patron saint, is said to have ended the drought of 1741, and is celebrated every four years during the Bajada de la Virgen, a month-long, island-wide fiesta.\nMore like this:• The Spanish island that communicates by whistle• The ingenious wines birthed from black volcanic craters• The world's revolt against 'bad tourists' \nAs I hiked through mist-wreathed pastures to the Árbol Garoé's moss-lined mountain grotto, the ground squelched underfoot, and my clothes and hair became as damp as if it was raining. \n\"It's a phenomenon known on the island as 'horizontal rain',\" explained my guide Enrica Baudino, co-founder of Atlantidea hiking company. \"When the moisture-laden north-east trade winds hit the mountains, they are forced to rise, and when they cool, they create a mist that leaves tiny droplets of water on vegetation – and hikers. The Bimbaches built tanks underneath trees and bushes to collect the water.\"\nAt a high point on the route, between Valverde and Tiñor, I looked over Gorona del Viento, El Hierro's pioneering wind-pumped hydropower station. Inaugurated in June 2014 with five 60m-tall wind turbines, two water reservoirs, four hydraulic turbines and one pumping station, it takes advantage of the island's unique topography – combining intermittent wind power with water power to create a constant supply of electricity – to fulfil the island's long-held dream of meeting all its energy needs from renewables. \n \nCristina Morales, Gorona del Viento's head of communications, explained how it works: \"Surplus wind power pumps desalinated water from a coastal reservoir to the upper reservoir set in a natural volcanic crater 700m above sea level,\" she said. \"When there's no wind, the water is released back to the lower reservoir where the hydraulic turbines generate any electricity shortfall.\"\nAnd the island is hitting its goals. In August 2015, for the first time, the power station generated all the electricity on the island for four hours and it made history in 2023 when it became the only island in the world to operate solely on wind and water power for 24 consecutive days, saving 13,708 tons of CO2 emissions and 4,509 tons of diesel. \nBut the wind turbines are spinning less and less in the face of climate change.\n\"Our production was lower in 2023 because we had a very long summer, with high temperatures and less wind. During September and October, we have a period known as the 'calms of September' – a time of calm seas, pleasant temperatures and little wind. Last year, they lasted almost until January,\" said Morales. \"That's why we are working on implementing other energy sources, such as photovoltaics.\"\nThis innovative island wants to be the first Spanish destination to achieve net zero emissions. \"We're developing a climate action plan,\" Suárez told me. \"The aim is to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030, and achieve zero emissions by 2050.\"\nThese are big ambitions for such a small isle, but its achievements in sustainability are being recognised. Gorona del Viento has long been a role model for renewable energy projects around the globe, and in September this year, El Hierro will be presented with the Canary Islands Tourism award for Sustainable Tourism Destination, thanks in part to its long-standing environmental policies.\n\"We want to continue to be pioneers,\" said Suárez, \"not just in the Canary Islands but around the world.\"\nThat evening, I headed to Faro de Orchilla, a clifftop lighthouse ringed by rippling red-hued lava, and looked out onto the vast ocean. In the 2nd Century, Greek mathematician and astronomer Ptolemy put El Hierro on the map after declaring that the prime meridian was here at Orchilla, the westernmost point of the island that was – before Columbus set sail in 1492 – the limit of the known world. Longitude zero may have moved to Greenwich in 1884, but as I watched the setting sun streak the water pink and gold, I knew that El Hierro would never lose its wild, edge-of-the-world feel.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}
{"id": 498, "question": "When did the three-star hierarchy of the Michelin Guide first appear?", "answer": ["1931"], "doc": ["[3] In the early post-war years, the lingering effects of wartime shortages led Michelin to impose an upper limit of two stars; by 1950 the French edition listed 38 establishments judged to meet this standard.[7] The first Michelin Guide for Italy was published in 1956. It awarded no stars in the first edition.", "The planning, the anticipation, the high hopes—it’s . As we look to the future after such a challenging moment in time, The MICHELIN Guide has been working to offer practical solutions for bringing the . You may have heard of Michelin's unique restaurant rating system, but how much do you really know what the coveted stars stand for?", "Yet despite its importance within the industry, the guide remains shrouded in mystery. Who decides which regions are covered? What are inspectors looking for? And most importantly, how does a restaurant get one or more of those all-so-coveted Michelin stars?", "Since it was first launched in 1900, the Michelin Guide has remained the benchmark for evaluating culinary excellence.", "[131] When Michelin published its first New York City Red Guide in 2005 Steven Kurutz of The New York Times noted that Danny Meyer's Union Square Cafe, a restaurant rated highly by The New York Times, Zagat Survey, and other prominent guides, received a no-star rating from Michelin (he did, however, acknowledge that the restaurant received positive mention for its ambiance, and that two other restaurants owned by Meyer received stars).", "It's one of the highest culinary honours to be bestowed on a restaurant, but for decades, the process around how they're awarded has been shrouded in secrecy.\nWill-they-won't-they romance aside, the most interesting plot point of the new season of Emily in Paris may be chef Gabriel's dream of obtaining a coveted Michelin star at his restaurant, l'Esprit de Gigi. From The Menu to The Bear, quite a few fictional chefs have been pursuing this illustrious distinction in recent years, and while Emily in Paris may get Paris so wrong, its treatment of the Michelin star's secrecy and solemnity is right on the money.\n\"Even for us, the Michelin Guide is a little hazy,\" said Julia Sedefdjian, who became France's youngest Michelin-starred chef at the age of 21. \"It's not like we have a grading scale in front of us.\"\nBut given the tight-lipped anonymity of the Guide's inspectors, perhaps the best people to offer insight into what it really takes to earn a Michelin star are chefs.\nThe Michelin Guide began humbly in 1900 as a free guidebook for Michelin tyre customers indicating refuelling stations, hotels and restaurants. The three-star hierarchy only surfaced in 1931, with one-starred establishments said to be worth a stop, two-starred a detour and three-starred a whole trip. The contemporary Guide is shrouded in mystery, with an undisclosed number of inspectors reviewing more than 40,000 restaurants in more than 30 countries. France alone counts 639 Michelin-starred restaurants, of which 75 have two stars, and just 30 have three.\nThe murky waters of what makes a restaurant worthy are clearer to Chef Maxime Bouttier after 15 years working in starred kitchens across France, as well as a stint Les 110 de Taillevant in London. \"I know how you can get a star,\" said the chef, who earned his first at Géosmine in March 2024. He cited \"codes\" like white tablecloths and soft piano music playing in the background, boxes some restaurateurs seek to tick. When Sedefdjian opened her Michelin-starred Baieta in Paris in 2018, she purposefully invested in beautiful tableware and stocked her wine cellar accordingly, even opening the restaurant in the space formerly occupied by Michelin-starred Itinéraires.\nSedefdjian's pursuit of stardom began far earlier, when she was just 14. She was attending culinary school and apprenticing at fine dining restaurant l'Aphrodite when it earned its first star. \"I saw what it was to have a chef who had been waiting for his star for years, to finally succeed,\" she recalled. \"It's something magical. I remember it as though it was yesterday, and it wasn't even mine.\"\nRestaurant insiders might have suspected Emily in Paris' season-four reveal of \"inspector\" Marianne as an imposter, seeing as when it comes to a Michelin review, chefs are always kept in the dark. \"We're never aware of the inspectors' visit,\" said Sedefdjian. \"If they introduce themselves, it's only after they've eaten. And often – very often – they never introduce themselves at all.\"\nThat said, a few clues are portrayed nearly to perfection in the 2015 film Burnt, when the manager conveys some odd behaviour to the chef: two customers, one ordering the tasting menu, the other à la carte, have ordered a half-bottle of wine and – crucially – placed a fork on the floor. “We used to say that they would put silverware on the ground to see if the waiter picked it up right away,” Sedefdjian said.\nFans of The Bear suspect the show of toying with the same trope in season three, when Richie notices a fork on the dining room floor. But there was no fork at Baieta; indeed, if the solo diner in his 40s hadn't introduced himself afterwards, Sedefdjian would have been none the wiser. \"You always think it's going to be an older person with a notebook.\"\nAfter the inspection, most learn about the status of their stars at a much-publicised ceremony. But for new restaurants, Sedefdjian said, \"Someone from the Guide calls you to let you know.\" As the ceremony loomed, however, \"I started saying to myself, 'This isn't possible. They're not going to call. They're never going to call.'\" And then, the day before the ceremony, an unlisted number popped up on her phone. \"My heart started racing,\" she said. \"It was someone from the Guide, calling to say, 'I wanted to let you know that your star is going to shine again.'\"\nBouttier, too, began his path to stardom at 14, when, upon sharing his desire to cook for a living, his mother pressed him to attend hotel school. \"It's a lot of theory, sitting on a chair,\" he said. \"If I wanted to be in the kitchen, it's because I was sick of being on a chair!\" They agreed on a compromise: that Bouttier seek an apprenticeship in a starred restaurant.\nFifteen years later, Bouttier opened Géosmine knowing he wanted a star – but on his own terms. \"We don't have tablecloths,\" he said. \"Our waiters are in Doc Martens. Our soundtrack is '80s rap. It's nothing like what we should have done to get a star.\" Nevertheless, Bouttier earned one less than a year after opening in April 2023.\nHis experience isn't an anomaly, according to trained chef, culinary instructor and gastronomy guide Allison Zinder. \"What I've noticed in the past 10 years or so is a much higher focus on the ingredients and techniques and what's on the plate than the plates themselves,\" she said. \"It's gotten much more simplified. It's less about the tablecloths.\"\nIn the trendy 11th arrondissement, Bouttier follows in the footsteps of neighbourhood pioneers like Bertrand Grébaut, whose Septime earned its first star in 2014 with waiters in sneakers and blue aprons, or Iñaki Aizpitarte, whose 2018 star at Le Chateaubriand came with nary a tablecloth to be found. Plates have evolved away from what Bouttier characterised as a \"demonstration of technicity\" where, often, \"you didn't even recognise the original ingredient\". Instead, contemporary Michelin-starred tables offer \"far more rustic plates with a lot of cuisine behind them\", he said. \"Lots of sauces, lots of preliminary preparations, but on the plate, the visual seems far simpler. Far more accessible.\"\nEarning a star can change things overnight for restaurateurs. L’Aphrodite closed temporarily to overhaul its galley-style kitchen into a grand cuisine, and Bouttier streamlined his offerings into a single prix-fixe menu. The most palpable changes, however, were beyond his control. \"We've got a starred clientele now, and that clientele is much more annoying,\" he said, citing guests horrified to learn they cannot bring \"dogs the size of cows\" to dinner. For Sedefdjian, the main change is in mindset: \"It brings a different sort of rigour.\"\nThe Bear and Burnt showcase the potential detriments of such an environment – on mental health and on lifestyle.\"You need to make a lot – a lot – of sacrifices,\" said Bouttier. He admitted his own meticulous nature has made him \"not easy to work with\".\n\"I'm only 32, but my management style is old-school,\" he said. \"If you start at 08:00, you're in the kitchen at 08:00. If you want to have a coffee and change, you get there at 20 to 08:00.”\nThe pressure is only magnified by Bouttier's next goal: a second star. To get there, he believes he'll need to hire more staff and renovate his kitchen. He'll reduce the number of covers from 30 to 22, which means a price hike. But it'll be worth it.\nMore like this: • The ingenious story behind Michelin stars • The future of food according to Massimo Bottura • Paris's most authentic and delicious bistros\n\"All of the places where I had fun as I was dining, in my life, were two-starred places,\" he said, noting that as a chef, two stars leaves you room to grow. \"If you have three stars,\" he said, \"you can lose them all.\"\nThe counterpoint to the joy of earning a Michelin star is the pain of losing one. The potential loss of his third star has been cited as a possible motivation behind Chef Bernard Loiseau's death by suicide in 2003; and after losing his third Michelin star in 2019, Chef Marc Veyrat demanded to be removed from the Guide entirely. It's perhaps no surprise that Emily in Paris' Chef Gabriel (spoiler!) is so relieved to learn, in season four, that he didn't actually get his star after all.\n\"I've always been motivated by [the pressure],\" said Sedefdjian. \"But I can understand that there are chefs out there who say it's too many obstacles.\"\nFor Bouttier, the trick is keeping things in perspective. Chefs blinded by stars \"are the people who forget their identity\", he said. \"They will have cooked for years just to have that star, forgetting everything else.\"\nInstead, both young chefs are keeping their culinary integrity at the forefront.\n\"The star rewards a rigour and a quality of work, and that's what's important,\" said Bouttier. \"It's the path that gets you to the star.

This is the Dutch speedster's guide to enjoying the Dutch capital, during F1 and beyond.\nBoasting world-famous museums, nightlife to satisfy any urge and a unique cityscape crisscrossed by 165 canals, Amsterdam truly has something for everyone. That's why, after 10 years touring the world as a Formula Three, Formula 1, Sports Car, A1 and IndyCar Series racing driver, Rotterdam-born Robert Doornbos made the city his home in 2018.\nIn 2021, Doornbos was present at the first Dutch Grand Prix in 36 years. Held at the Zandvoort track, more than 40km west of Amsterdam, the circuit is next to the beach, which only helps to increase the party atmosphere.\n\"You won't believe your eyes when you get to the beach at Zandvoort on race weekend,\" says Doornbos. \"The Dutch are so passionate about Formula 1. The party is on! The promoters even won an award [in 2023] because of how they entertained the people.\"\nOf course, it helps that the reigning Formula 1 world champion, Max Verstappen, competes for the Netherlands, though he was born in Belgium. \"Formula 1 exploded [here] thanks to Max. Especially in 2021,\" says Doornbos, who was working as a live analyst at the 2021 Abu Dhabi race for Ziggo Sport when Verstappen beat Lewis Hamilton for his first title. \"We had six million viewers for the final race,\" he adds. \"I was awake for three days after celebrating. When I got home, I couldn't even walk down the street. It just exploded in popularity.\"\nOf course, there are plenty of other things to experience in Amsterdam besides the Grand Prix. \"It's such a great place to live,\" says Doornbos. \"There is so much history. There are great bars and restaurants that have new concepts. Plus, there are so many different ways to keep healthy.\"\nHere are Doornbos' recommendations for enjoying the Dutch capital.\nAt just 165sq km, Amsterdam is considered tiny compared to other European capitals.

Thwaites Glacier is roughly equidistant between the UK’s Rothera Research Station and the US McMurdo Research Station. The Thwaites region of West Antarctica is due south of the western US, 7000 miles away.", "Why is Thwaites Glacier of so much interest, however? How much ice is there, and how much would sea levels rise if it all melted? Thwaites Glacier is roughly the size of UK (176 x103 km2). The glacier terminus is nearly 120 km wide, and the bed of the glacier reaches to >1000 m below sea level.", "The glacier covers approximately 74,100 square miles (192,000 square km)—an area about the size of the U.S. state of Florida and slightly smaller than the island of Great Britain. It is named for American glacial geologist and geomorphologist Frederik T. Thwaites.", "Thwaites Glacier is often called the “doomsday glacier” because of its massive size and potential to dramatically raise global sea levels. As the world warms, it could drop billions of tons of ice into the Amundsen Sea and open a path for more inland ice to flow freely to the coast.", "These channels could be explained by the large catchment size (189 000 km2) of Thwaites Glacier (Joughin et al., 2009), its funnel-like geometry, and high basal melt rates of 3.5 km3 yr−1 (Joughin et al., 2009), which together accumulate enough water to exceed the critical discharge threshold within 100–200 km from the grounding line.", "In her latest book, The Quickening, the Pulitzer Prize finalist embarked on an epic odyssey to one of the most important – and least-explored – places in the world.\nIn 2019, 57 scientists and crew embarked on a 54-day journey to the farthest reaches of Antarctica. Their mission: Thwaites Glacier, a rapidly crumbling block of ice the size of Britain melting so fast it's known as the world's \"doomsday glacier\". \nThwaites is currently disappearing eight times as fast as it was in the 1990s, dumping 80 billion tonnes of ice into the ocean every year and accounting for 4% of the planet's annual sea level rise. Because of its colossal size and alarming collapse, this remote ice cap is not only considered one of the scariest places on Earth, but also one of the most important: the frozen ground zero in the global fight against climate change. Were Thwaites to completely melt, it could raise sea levels by 10ft or more, triggering \"spine-chilling\" global implications.\nBut a new study published this week suggests that the the so-called doomsday glacier may not be disappearing as quickly as had once been feared – though it is still rapidly vanishing. Instead of the glacier's ice cliffs soon collapsing into the ocean like a row of dominoes, the new study offers a somewhat more hopeful – if still dire – timeline of its disappearance. \"What we are seeing with Thwaites Glacier right now is a disaster in slow motion,\" polar scientist Mathieu Morlighem, who led the study, told The Conversation. \nOne of the people who participated in the once-in-a-lifetime journey to Thwaites in 2019 was Elizabeth Rush, whose vivid, poetic book about climate change, Rising, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Rush's latest book, The Quickening, chronicles this historic voyage to Thwaites' calving edge – a frigid, far-flung place never-before visited by humans.\nRush sat down with BBC Travel to discuss her Antarctic odyssey, how it changed her perception of the world and the ethics around travelling to some of the Earth's most fragile ecosystems.\nWhere is Thwaites glacier and how did you first hear about this expedition? \nThwaites Glacier is this really enigmatic place in Antarctica. It's in the far reaches of the Amundsen Sea. It was a four-day journey to the nearest research base. When I signed up to be part of this mission, my programme officer said to me, \"You know, it's easier for us to get help to folks working on the space station than it is just to get help to you guys if you have trouble.\" There's concern that Thwaites is entering a rapid period of collapse, but the reality is that no one had ever been to [its calving edge]. \nI applied to be part of the mission through the Antarctic Artists & Writers Program. They send usually two writers or artists per year to Antarctica, and I put together a 60-page application. There was a paragraph-long footnote to my application that was like: \"I write about sea level rise. I want to go to these different places in Antarctica and see the sort of sea level rise firsthand.\" I was very lucky I was given the last berth on this ice-breaking vessel. \nWhat kind of global effects would it have if sea levels were to rise 10ft or more? \nWell, the speed with which it happens makes a tremendous difference. So, 10ft over two centuries is really different than 10ft over 40 years. The concern is really what do human beings do about it? \nI'm a huge proponent of managed retreat, which is having a government entity intervene in low-lying areas and essentially purchase flood-prone homes for pre-flooding value, giving the folks who live there the opportunity to take that money and move up and in with it. \nNew York City has already done some managed retreat on Staten Island. The state intervened and they purchased and demolished over 500 homes on Staten Island. Eighty percent of those residents were able to take the money that they were given for their home and move elsewhere on Staten Island. We sometimes think that managed retreat is like fracturing communities, and that's not necessarily how it plays out. \nSo, sea level rise is not catastrophic if we prepare for it – and that's a big if.\nWhy do you think that you were one of the people chosen to be part of this expedition? \nIn the application, I wrote about how I would write a book that would have my narration as the main thrust but would include the voices of scientists and crew working in these places. The goal was to build a kind of polyphonic chorus to subtly shift who we think of as the narrator of Antarctic stories. \nThe first person to see Antarctica saw it, like, 200 years ago, and in this very short window of time, we've told a very narrow story about Antarctica – one that has a lot to do with human conquest and human beings overcoming incredible odds to do the unthinkable. Often those human beings are white men from the global north. All the stories about Antarctica sort of sound the same. I wanted to create a story about Antarctica that was much more democratic. From the get-go, I knew I was going to interview the cooks, the engineers, the Antarctic support staff on board. I think that that played a significant role in getting the application selected because, it was like, I'm going to talk about the science, but I'm going to do it in a way that challenges some of the dominant narratives we tell about Antarctica. \nAre there any stories that stuck with you about how this epic voyage changed the way travellers not normally included in the Antarctica narrative see the world? \nI remember talking to a guy named Jack who was a cook on the vessel. He's from New Orleans, and he signed up to be a cook on this expedition to help better take care of his grandfather financially. His grandfather died a couple weeks before we were to set sail and Jack still came. He had never been on a plane. He went on three different flights to get from New Orleans to Punta Arenas, [Chile], where we set sail. He'd never been on a ship. He'd never seen penguins. And even coming from New Orleans, he had never thought super-seriously about sea level rise. This whole experience was full of firsts for him. \nHaving the time to ponder the future of climate change can be a thing that folks do who are not trying to put food on the table every single day. But when he saw Thwaites, I remember him being like, 'Oh, I get it.' The glacier itself, when we arrived, it looked like arriving at The Wall in Game of Thrones. It was so big. It took us three weeks to get there. You feel like you're as far away from human beings as you possibly can be. And to imagine that our actions so far away are literally causing this epic wall to fall apart, it gives you goosebumps.\nThere's an ongoing debate about the kinds of places we should and shouldn't visit on Earth. One thought is to leave these hard-to-reach, fragile ecosystems alone. Another view is that witnessing their fragility up close leads people to care more deeply about them. What places, if any, do you think we shouldn't visit? \nIt's a great question, and I can only answer it from a really personal level. When we crossed back over the Southern Ocean, I knew I would never go back [to Antarctica]. I knew that my going was a one-time thing and that it made sense in the context of me coming back and working for five years to write a book about the expedition. Without that deeper meaning or impulse behind the trip, I wouldn't feel right making it. \nI can say strongly that in the context of casual tourism, I don't think we should go to Antarctica. I don't think that cruise ships should go there. I don't think that casual tourism to these places that feel \"untouched\" or remote should be a thing that accelerates. But there's some part of me that wrestles a little bit at the distinction between remote and closed, or untouched and touched. At this point, Antarctica is touched by us, the Amazon is touched by us, even if we like to think of them as these mythical, untouched places. \nI think in general, yes, we see something and we care more about it. The older I get, the more I'm trying to turn that curiosity closer to home. I can walk around my neighbourhood with my three-year-old and see all these amazing butterfly bushes and mini ecosystems in my neighbour's yards. And I think that we can also treat those places with the same kind of wonder and enchantment that we might treat Antarctica or the Amazon.\nWhat are some things anyone taking a trip to Antarctica should know? \nThe first person to see Antarctica saw it just over 200 years ago. This is a place so powerful it literally held humans at arm's length for the overwhelming majority of human history. There is no other place on the planet like that. Every other place you go has indigenous stories rising up out of it for thousands of years. This is the only place on the planet where there is none of that. And so, I think it demands a certain amount of respect and awareness that it is like an agent in its own right. \nTo be able to get close to it is so rare and so new in the history of the planet. So, if you're going to go there, I want you to go there with that awareness of just how extraordinary what you're doing is and just how powerful a place Antarctica is that you're visiting. \nHow did seeing this massive glacier slowly melt away affect you? \nThe day we arrived at Thwaites glacier, it was really calm and our captain sailed us all along the calving front of the glacier. That was a spectacular day. Then the switch flipped, and we started working our butts off for six days: throwing sediment cores [samples from beneath the seafloor that reveal the Earth's past geology and climate] over the sides, tagging elephant seals, sending submarines under the glacier. Every day, the ice looked different. \nOn the seventh day, I woke up, went to the bridge and there were way more icebergs than before, but I didn't register it as strange and went about my work. Then, just after lunch, the chief scientist on board was looking at these two satellite images: one was Thwaites in which it was a solid ice sheet, and in the next image, it looked like an angry God had taken a hammer to the glacier and broken it into 300 icebergs. We're talking about an area of the glacier that's like maybe 15 miles wide by 10 miles deep. The first image was taken on the day we arrived, and the second image was taken on that seventh morning. [The chief scientist] looked at it and said, \"Oh my God, Thwaites has entered a period of rapid collapse. This is happening right in front of us.\" He sent that information up to the captain and the decision was made to leave the study area immediately.\nThe thing that was so shocking to me was that this collapse event could literally be happening in front of my eyes and I wouldn't know it. It was so big I missed it, which is humbling. If you can't see a glacier fall to pieces in front of you, then that means that the phenomenon is way bigger than you initially imagined and that your perspective is the wrong perspective to see it. I think that's an excellent metaphor for climate change. It's really hard for humans to see it. \nHow does going to the farthest reaches of the Earth change your view of humanity? \nIt was so otherworldly. It does make me feel how precious and miraculous it is that we exist. I felt like it was close to touching down on another planet, and to see how difficult it would be to eke out a human existence on another planet makes me really grateful for ours; and also, just really aware of what happens in Antarctica doesn't stay in Antarctica. The Antarctic circumpolar current that swirls around Antarctica is the piston in the pump that drives worldwide ocean circulation patterns. We're starting to change that current. As we're changing that current, we're changing global ocean patterns all over the world. This sense that we live in a big, interconnected web of ecosystems definitely grew with seeing Antarctica and spending so much time there. \nAfter this latest project how do you feel about the future? \nHaving a child for me was an act of wilful optimism about the future. And now that my child is here, I do think that things will probably be worse in his lifetime than I've probably fully dealt with as I thought about bringing him onto this planet. That doesn't change my decision, but it does make me feel and get more serious about having a meaningful impact in my lifetime. \nIt also makes me feel much more committed to teaching him things like how to live through uncomfortable situations and moments of big change, because I think those are coming. I think it's even more important to teach him how to work with other people and create partnerships and allegiances with other people. So, as much as I think he has to be resilient and adaptable, he also has to be part of a human community that will take care of him, and hopefully, that he will take care of.\n--\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".

{"id": 505, "question": "What is the name of the train that allows passengers to travel the 115km journey from Interlaken to Montreux without changing trains?", "answer": ["GoldenPass Express (GPX)"], "doc": ["The new panoramic train of the Montreux Oberland Bernois Railway Company will run between Interlaken and Montreux up to four times a day (from June 2023), offering uninterrupted views of the breathtaking panorama. Prestigious The new travel class “Prestige” is the centrepiece of the new train.", "Its 115km journey follows a medieval trade route connecting Interlaken's glaciers to Montreux's terraced vineyards, and thanks to a technological innovation, the GPX allows travellers to take one of the world's most scenic train routes without transferring, as passengers did previously.", "From Interlaken to Montreux The GoldenPass Express redefines the travel experience between Interlaken and Montreux. On one of Switzerland’s most picturesque train routes, the GoldenPass Express provides a seamless and comfortable travel experience.", "Pioneering technology means passengers can now travel directly from #Montreux to #Interlaken on the #GoldenPass train without having to change. @MySwitzerland_e https://t.co/WBUQfj329B It emerged today (13th December) that the 45 minute delay at Zweisimmen was due to one of the guide railers (unsure of the correct name sorry) not deploying.", "Given that the role of GPX trains is also to better connect Montreux with Lucerne, on which route only one change of trains will be necessary from this December, the MOB also mentions the prospective possibility that the new gauge-changing technology could also eliminate a change of trains at Interlaken, if a gauge changer is installed there as well.", "Tracing a medieval trade route through the Swiss Alps and valleys, the GoldenPass Express isn't just one of the world's most scenic train rides; it's an engineering marvel.\nAs I sink into the plush, cream-coloured leather recliner, a glass of Champagne in hand and hiking boots raised, I'm ready for a three-hour spectacle where nature takes centre stage. But the stage isn't just in front of me – it's all around.\nI'm not in a theatre; I'm in Switzerland aboard the GoldenPass Express: a state-of-the-art panoramic train where floor-to-ceiling windows reveal stunning views of the Swiss countryside – from turquoise lakes that mirror towering mountain peaks to rolling meadows dotted with storybook chalets – that rival the grandest cinematic experiences. Sitting in the nine-seat Prestige Class carriage in a specially designed heated, swivelling chair feels both private and personal – as if I've got the snowcapped Alps, wildflower-laced pastures and bell-adorned cows to myself.\nOpened in December 2022 and fully relaunched in June 2023 after addressing problems with track wear, The GoldenPass Express (GPX) is one of Europe's newest (and most luxurious) high-tech trains. Its 115km journey follows a medieval trade route connecting Interlaken's glaciers to Montreux's terraced vineyards, and thanks to a technological innovation, the GPX allows travellers to take one of the world's most scenic train routes without transferring, as passengers did previously.\nThe GPX is one of five premium panoramic trains within the Swiss Travel System. Individual tickets range from 56-145 Swiss francs (roughly £50-130). It's also included in the Swiss Travel Pass (starting from 244 Swiss francs – roughly £219 – and children under 16 ride free of charge) which offers unlimited access to all public transportation (trains, trams, buses and passenger ferries), 50% off mountain railways and gondolas, and free admission to more than 500 museums.\nThe train's midnight-blue exterior and classic design evoke the bygone era of the original Orient Express that still connects Paris to Istanbul. Inside, the interior is crisp and cutting-edge, the Prestige Class specially designed chairs are by Ferrari-designer firm Pininfarina and are the only such rail seats in Europe. Need lower back support? There's a button for that. Tired feet? Elevate your legs. Feeling chilly? Just press the seat warmer. Want a different view? Simply pivot your seat to face the direction of your choice. Just don't fall asleep!\nBut what truly sets the GPX apart from other luxury trains is something you can't see: it can seamlessly jump between tracks of different gauges and voltages.\nBuilt by Montreux-Oberland-Bernois Railway (MOB) in collaboration with BLS AG (BLS) in Bern, the train winds its way down from the heights of the Bernese Alps, passing the luxurious town of Gstaad, beloved by A-listers for its exclusivity and isolation, and Château d'Oex, famous for its hot air balloon festival (25 January-2 February 2025), before snaking through vineyards as it makes its dramatic descent towards the Vaudois Riviera. Finally, it reaches sun-soaked Montreux, where palms sway on the glistening shores of Lake Geneva.\nIn 1905, when MOB set out to build the GoldenPass line, the aim was to connect Francophone Montreux to German-speaking Interlaken – two big touristic and economic hubs – with a single trainline. But somewhere along the way, MOB noticed the rail wasn't the same width; the gauges varied. It took 120 years to find a system bridging the gap.\nThe world's railroads use a patchwork of varying gauges – mainly broad, standard and narrow. Railway development lacked industry standards in the 19th Century, leading to varied gauges to suit terrain, transport purpose and political influences. This is one of the main reasons why we often need to change trains when we're travelling.\nAs Trains magazine senior editor David Lassen tells the BBC, \"countries slow to settle on a single gauge paid the price with operating challenges\". Case in point: Switzerland.\nThe idea of directly connecting Lake Geneva to Lakes Thun and Brienz in Interlaken dates to the late 1800s. Since 1916, the Lucerne-Interlaken-Zweisimmen-Montreux route, known as the GoldenPass line, allowed travel between these destinations, but required two train changes because of the tracks' differing gauges. In 1928, the concept of adding a third rail was discussed.\n\"That would have required building tunnels,\" said MOB product manager Fanny Moix. She explained that this was \"technically impossible\" because of a combination of bureaucracy and the complexity of building dual-gauge tracks through a busy, complicated junction.\nStill, as Interlaken Tourism markets manager Celina Finger maintains: \"Changing trains is a huge hassle for tourists.\" It's also a reason why the GoldenPass line hasn't been as popular as its panoramic counterparts, like the Glacier Express.\nNow, instead of requiring travellers to change trains in the middle of the journey, the GPX can make the three-hour-15-minute journey directly, thanks to the revolutionary \"variable gauge bogie\". The technology, developed in 2022 after 15 years of research and costing 89m Swiss francs (£80m), was publicly funded by the cantons of Vaud, Bern, Freiburg and the Swiss Confederation. This innovation facilitates seamless transitions between narrow and standard gauges and voltage changes within seconds, effectively enabling a train to jump tracks while moving. It's a groundbreaking new standard in rail travel – not just in Switzerland, but globally.\n\"[The GPX] is a link to our past and our future,\" said Frédéric Delachaux, MOB marketing director, explaining that it realises the centuries-old dream of linking Switzerland to Europe by rail via the Alps.\nAs I made the historic journey for the first time, approaching Zweisimmen station, I hesitated to leave the comforts of my warm seat where I was nibbling on local cheeses (there is no full-service dining on board but there are local snack options). I stretched my legs and peered out the window as we briefly paused for the locomotive change, which allows the train to adapt to the electrical voltage change. A few minutes later, we were travelling towards Schönried, a ski resort town neighbouring Gstaad, and as the train carried on, I barely felt a thing.\nMeanwhile, as the train's elevation shifted ever so slightly (rising about 200 mm) to accommodate the gauge attrition and platform height, an engineering marvel was happening right below my feet – even if only a discerning train aficionado would notice it.\n\"It's a big frustration for us in marketing because you don't feel anything!\" lamented Delachaux. Perhaps the engineers did too good a job. Because of this, the gauge change is displayed on a screen to passengers as it's happening.\nMore like this:• A new night train connecting some of Europe's great cities • One of the world's most scenic train lines • Europe's narrowest-gauge train\nWhile there are other trains in France and Japan that can move a few centimetres, \"this is the only train in the world that moves 43cm\", said Delachaux.\nIt's perhaps no surprise that the Swiss were able to pull off this engineering feat. Living in a landlocked nation that's 70% mountainous and filled with some 1,500 lakes, people here have long had to negotiate the obstacles posed by their challenging terrain – and along the way, exemplified a certain determination and ingenuity that is decidedly Swiss.\nAs Clarence Rook wrote in his 1907 book Switzerland and Its People: \"There are bigger mountains in the world than may be found in Switzerland. But you will nowhere find in so small a space so many triumphs of engineering. The Swiss roads and railways stand as a monument to the victory of human skill over physical obstacles.\"\nAnd so, I wondered, are there plans to connect the entire GoldenPass line from its origin at Lucerne to Montreux?\n\"That's the new dream,\" said Moix, laughing. \"It's also a technical issue because between Lucerne and Interlaken we have a cog railway. That means we'd need to add a cog system to the GoldenPass Express, and that takes a lot of time – another lifetime.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}
{"id": 506, "question": "What technological feature of the GoldenPass Express enables it to seamlessly switch between tracks of different gauges and voltages?", "answer": ["Variable gauge bogie"], "doc": ["The GoldenPass Express is historic, a feat of technology over a decade in the making: It’s the first train in the world that shifts from metric gauge to standard gauge while moving, thanks to the bogies seamlessly adjusting gauge width within seconds while passengers are on board.", "This technological innovation means that the GoldenPass Express trains are the only direct trains between Montreux and Interlaken. The GoldenPass Express is an excellent way to travel the scenic route between Montreux to Interlaken or vice-versa.", "The terms “GoldenPass Express” and “Golden Pass Panoramic” refer to the same scenic train journey between Montreux and Interlaken. The names are used interchangeably. Is GoldenPass Express a panoramic train?", "These famous locations lie within reach of Interlaken (such as Jungrafuoch, and the villages of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald). The GoldenPass Express eliminates the need for a change of trains between Montreux and Interlaken. Currently, the train schedule of the GoldenPass Express offers four trains daily from Montreux to Interlaken Ost, at 7.", "Since 1916, the Lucerne-Interlaken-Zweisimmen-Montreux route, known as the GoldenPass line, allowed travel between these destinations, but required two train changes because of the tracks' differing gauges. In 1928, the concept of adding a third rail was discussed. \"That would have required building tunnels,\" said MOB product manager Fanny Moix.", "Tracing a medieval trade route through the Swiss Alps and valleys, the GoldenPass Express isn't just one of the world's most scenic train rides; it's an engineering marvel.\nAs I sink into the plush, cream-coloured leather recliner, a glass of Champagne in hand and hiking boots raised, I'm ready for a three-hour spectacle where nature takes centre stage. But the stage isn't just in front of me – it's all around.\nI'm not in a theatre; I'm in Switzerland aboard the GoldenPass Express: a state-of-the-art panoramic train where floor-to-ceiling windows reveal stunning views of the Swiss countryside – from turquoise lakes that mirror towering mountain peaks to rolling meadows dotted with storybook chalets – that rival the grandest cinematic experiences. Sitting in the nine-seat Prestige Class carriage in a specially designed heated, swivelling chair feels both private and personal – as if I've got the snowcapped Alps, wildflower-laced pastures and bell-adorned cows to myself.\nOpened in December 2022 and fully relaunched in June 2023 after addressing problems with track wear, The GoldenPass Express (GPX) is one of Europe's newest (and most luxurious) high-tech trains. Its 115km journey follows a medieval trade route connecting Interlaken's glaciers to Montreux's terraced vineyards, and thanks to a technological innovation, the GPX allows travellers to take one of the world's most scenic train routes without transferring, as passengers did previously.\nThe GPX is one of five premium panoramic trains within the Swiss Travel System. Individual tickets range from 56-145 Swiss francs (roughly £50-130). It's also included in the Swiss Travel Pass (starting from 244 Swiss francs – roughly £219 – and children under 16 ride free of charge) which offers unlimited access to all public transportation (trains, trams, buses and passenger ferries), 50% off mountain railways and gondolas, and free admission to more than 500 museums.\nThe train's midnight-blue exterior and classic design evoke the bygone era of the original Orient Express that still connects Paris to Istanbul. Inside, the interior is crisp and cutting-edge, the Prestige Class specially designed chairs are by Ferrari-designer firm Pininfarina and are the only such rail seats in Europe. Need lower back support? There's a button for that. Tired feet? Elevate your legs. Feeling chilly? Just press the seat warmer. Want a different view? Simply pivot your seat to face the direction of your choice. Just don't fall asleep!\nBut what truly sets the GPX apart from other luxury trains is something you can't see: it can seamlessly jump between tracks of different gauges and voltages.\nBuilt by Montreux-Oberland-Bernois Railway (MOB) in collaboration with BLS AG (BLS) in Bern, the train winds its way down from the heights of the Bernese Alps, passing the luxurious town of Gstaad, beloved by A-listers for its exclusivity and isolation, and Château d'Oex, famous for its hot air balloon festival (25 January-2 February 2025), before snaking through vineyards as it makes its dramatic descent towards the Vaudois Riviera. Finally, it reaches sun-soaked Montreux, where palms sway on the glistening shores of Lake Geneva.\nIn 1905, when MOB set out to build the GoldenPass line, the aim was to connect Francophone Montreux to German-speaking Interlaken – two big touristic and economic hubs – with a single trainline. But somewhere along the way, MOB noticed the rail wasn't the same width; the gauges varied. It took 120 years to find a system bridging the gap.\nThe world's railroads use a patchwork of varying gauges – mainly broad, standard and narrow. Railway development lacked industry standards in the 19th Century, leading to varied gauges to suit terrain, transport purpose and political influences. This is one of the main reasons why we often need to change trains when we're travelling.\nAs Trains magazine senior editor David Lassen tells the BBC, \"countries slow to settle on a single gauge paid the price with operating challenges\". Case in point: Switzerland.\nThe idea of directly connecting Lake Geneva to Lakes Thun and Brienz in Interlaken dates to the late 1800s. Since 1916, the Lucerne-Interlaken-Zweisimmen-Montreux route, known as the GoldenPass line, allowed travel between these destinations, but required two train changes because of the tracks' differing gauges. In 1928, the concept of adding a third rail was discussed.\n\"That would have required building tunnels,\" said MOB product manager Fanny Moix.

One of the most popular hikes is the 4.4km trek to the summit of the iconic Gros Piton Mountain, one of two peaks that soar over Jalousie Beach, a powdery white-sand crescent surrounded by coral reefs. The hike may seem short, but it's considered particularly challenging due to the 798m elevation gain.\nFor those more interested in the water than the land, the island also has stunning beaches to explore, including several volcanic black sand beaches, and excellent diving spots like the Anse Piton Marine Reserve.\nThe island's food scene offers a unique window into its history.

I have never felt this liberated before in my life,\" Bailey stated in a joint press release with St Lucia Tourism. \"I was able to create this body of work in a space where I feel the most free and happy, literally writing away my troubles in paradise.\"\nPartially because of this newfound attention, the St Lucia Tourism Authority says the island is preparing for an influx of guests. It is adding 40,000 more air seats to the island in 2024, including direct flights from New York on JetBlue and American Airlines, new nonstop Air Canada flights from Toronto, and destinations across the Caribbean via Caribbean Airlines and InterCaribbean. There are also several new hotel properties set to open in 2024 and 2025, including a Secrets St Lucia Resort & Spa and wellness chain TheLifeCo Well-being's first Caribbean retreat centre. The new hotels are expected to add an additional 2,000 hotel rooms by the end of 2025. One all-inclusive wellness resort called BodyHoliday has even launched a special \"Balance and Performance\" package in honour of St. Lucian sprinter.\n\"Julien embodies the very essence of our nation's pride and resilience,\" said Whitfield. \"We are excited to welcome her home and recognise her as a true ambassador of St Lucia.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Fast-forward to today, and high hotel room rates, fuelled by years of rising real estate prices, have supercharged this typically low-cost concept, which offers budget travellers priced out of traditional hotels more privacy than a hostel dormitory and more comfort and connectivity than camping. The capsules, which are predominantly single-occupancy, also answer the current boom in solo travel, with single-sex capsule hotels providing additional security.\nWith the global capsule hotel market projected to reach $327m by 2031, curious hybrids have emerged to sustain the trend and attract new customers.

In the Shinagawa Station (men only) and Akasaka branches, guests can sign up for a \"9h sleep fitscan\" service, where sensors detect everything from breathing to facial expressions to generate a sleep report that tracks their heart rate, identifies sleep apnea and even monitors snoring. In a sector where a novel or low-budget stay is often prioritised over comfort, Nine Hours' interest in how well its guests are sleeping sets it apart.\nAcross the franchise, the white, minimalist decor continues this clinical theme, while its rows of sleek, shiny sleeping pods would not look out of place on the set of a science-fiction movie. The name refers to the hotel's cost-cutting concept that reduces room rental to the essential nine hours, allowing seven hours for sleep and an hour on either side for washing and dressing. Just need a nap? Hourly rates are also available.\nA night in a transparent sleeping pod clinging to a cliff face above Peru's Sacred Valley is not everyone's idea of a relaxing stay, but for adrenaline-lovers, it's hard to beat – not least for the incredible 300-degree views of the surrounding mountains and the formidable condors that inhabit them.\nA near-vertical climb of 400m is the only way to reach the Skylodge Adventure Suites, but climbing experience is not necessary – only good health and a head for heights – and descending is speedier thanks to a series of zip wires. Each capsule includes a private bathroom ensuring that night trips to the toilet are not life-threatening, and when the sun rises, you can enjoy a cup of tea on your private deck. Looking for a little more luxury? A little further down the Urubamba river, sister site, Starlodge, adds hillside hot tubs to the capsule hotel experience.\nThe Tubo Hotel, La Tatacoa is just a 10-minute drive from Colombia's second-largest desert, the eponymous Tatacoa, famous for its clear starry skies. When you've taken in the giant cacti and curious rock formations of the Tatacoa's cinnamon-coloured sands, this rainbow of tiny, air-conditioned rooms with a shared swimming pool offers a welcome oasis.

Opened in 2021 and based on an aesthetic it describes as \"soft minimalist\", KINN Capsule offers a Zen take on the capsule concept with walls painted in calming peachy tones and pale wood sleeping chambers fitted with crisp white bed linen. Even the smell of the place seems an antidote to its urban location as a special house fragrance designed to evoke the wildflowers of a Nordic forest hangs in the air. There are 72 capsules in total, sealed off with blackout blinds and spread across seven rooms, but the vibe is more boutique than bunkhouse.\nA traditional mud and wood farmhouse in eastern China's Zhejiang Province got a prize-winning makeover in 2019 when it reopened as a capsule hostel, bookstore and community library, sleeping 20 in tiny single bed-sized compartments concealed between bookshelves made of local bamboo. A smattering of small landings are connected by zigzagging stairways that recall the serpentine paths of the surrounding forests of Tonglu. It's hard to know which is more dramatic: the remote building's transparent floor-to-ceiling panels that light it up like a cathedral at night, or the lush mountainous scenery that's visible through them.\nIn Oud Zuid, one of Amsterdam's most upscale neighbourhoods, guests are paying to sleep in cupboards. The quirky De Bedstee Hotel draws on the 17th-Century tradition of the Dutch bedstee (box bed), a bed concealed behind cupboard doors to create a cosy sleeping nook. The hotel's Art Deco features and acid-coloured wallpapers downstairs give way to a shabby-chic design in the first-floor dormitories, where the bedstee windows are framed by red gingham curtains and little wooden ladders lead to the capsules above. Relax in the hotel's small terrace garden or take a half-hour stroll to the Rembrandt House Museum in the city centre to see several historic box beds in situ.\nAnother hotel with a signature smell is the Resol Poshtel in Tokyo's Asakusa district – the Resol Hotel chain's first venture into capsule sleeping. The aroma, which includes orange, chamomile and neroli, is said to induce \"a feeling of gentle calm\" – of benefit, perhaps, given the communal sleeping arrangements. At bedtime, there's nothing but a curtain between you and fellow visitors, but few one-star establishments can match this hotel's cleanliness and functionality, with hairbrushes, slippers and razors included in the freebies. The Edo-era styling − such as the sleeping cubicles' arched entrance reminiscent of tea ceremony rooms, and the traditional Japanese murals surrounding the bed − add a hint of heritage to the hotel's modern lines. The city's oldest Buddhist temple, Sensō-ji, is a five-minute walk away, as is the lantern-lined Nakamise-dori street, home to a parade of colourful shops selling souvenirs and street food.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Now he shares his favourite things to do in Cape Town, from whale spotting in False Bay to freediving in the kelp forests.\nSituated at the southern tip of Africa and surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, Cape Town's identity is woven with its waters. Once a refuelling station for the Dutch East India Company, its history goes further back – to the Khoekhoe and San Indigenous peoples, nomadic pastoralists and hunter-gatherers who once inhabited the region and lived off the land and sea.\nCape Town's intimate relationship with its coastline continues to the present day. Capetonians all seem to have at least one outdoorsy hobby, and it's not hard to understand why: in a single day, it’s possible to hike to the picturesque Lion's Head peak, go surfing at Muizenberg beach and dive the kelp forests of False Bay, thanks to the density of activities on offer. Winters in South Africa are often milder than in Europe, coinciding with climbing season (the nearby Cederberg mountains feature world-class routes) and whale migrations up the coast.\nWith no shortage of adventures, we spoke to renowned naturalist, author and documentarian Craig Foster, the creator behind the Academy Award-winning 2020 documentary My Octopus Teacher, about his favourite coastal activities. His latest book, Amphibious Soul: Finding the Wild in a Tame World, explores the importance of reconnecting with our intrinsic sense of wildness and relationship with the natural world, and there is perhaps no better place to experience this than in South Africa – where Foster grew up, a place he calls \"the heart of the world\".\nHere are Foster's favourite coastal adventures in Cape Town.\nFoster begins each day with a dive – a habit he has maintained for years thanks to its profound positive effects on his mind and body.\n\"Windmill Beach is a beautiful spot to dive,\" he says, referencing a popular beach on the Cape Peninsula. Foster encourages beginners to stick to the False Bay side as opposed to the Atlantic seaboard, thanks to the former's generally calmer conditions: \"It's usually protected from swell.\" Because the beach sits within the boundaries of a protected area, fishing and marine harvesting are prohibited. Once you’re underwater, expect to see various species of seaweed and kelp, along with shoals of fish, octopus and even small shy sharks darting between the boulders.\nDon't be fooled by the turquoise colours though. Cape Town's water temperatures can sometimes plunge into the single digits, especially in dive sites along the Atlantic. While Foster dives without a wetsuit, it takes time to build up a cold tolerance. \"Embrace the cold, but don't push it,\" he instructs. \"Enjoy the dopamine rush afterwards.\"\nOne of Foster's preferred ways to end a dive? Climbing out to lie on a Sun-warmed boulder, followed by a braai (South African barbecue) next to the ocean.\nAt the end of the Cape Peninsula is the Cape Point Nature Reserve, home to the Cape of Good Hope and a sprawling landscape of fynbos shrubbery and endemic species such as Chacma baboons and Cape clawless otter. It’s one of Foster's beloved places to track wildlife.\n\"Tracking is like a window across time into the past and future,\" says Foster, who encourages people to always pay attention to the signs nature leaves behind when they venture into the wild. While markings in the sand can leave \"amazing pictures of what happened in the night\", observing animal behaviour can also yield clairvoyant signs into the future. \"Fleeing amphipods can be a sign of a storm to come,\" he explains.\nAt the Origins Exhibit at the Buffelsfontein Visitors Centre in Cape Point Nature Reserve, Foster's work with his organisation, the Sea Change Project, and discoveries made via tracking are on display. From archaeological evidence, \"this [area] is possibly one of the first places in the world where people swam and dived,\" he says. \"So many mental health issues are because we are disconnected from our environment… tracking is a way of feeling like one belongs to the landscape.\"\nWebsite: https://capepoint.co.za/visitus/  Address: Buffelsfontein Visitors Centre, Cape Peninsula, Cape TownPhone: +27 (0)21 780 9204\nPerfect for beginners in the water and families with kids, Cape Town's popular and numerous tidal pools are a fantastic spot to get your feet wet – literally. \"It's a good idea to start in tidal pools,\" Foster says. \"They are all around the whole coast and fed constantly by the sea. I've observed incredible animal behaviour in tidal pools and had incredible interactions with octopus.\" From Dalebrook to Glencairn to Miller's Point, rocky watering holes dot the peninsula's perimeter. Essentially natural swimming pools, they are free to access and provide a safe place to take the plunge.\n\"Go early in the morning to avoid crowds,\" he notes. And be sure to take a moment to float on your back and stare up at the sky. \"There's something great about doing nothing.\"\nWhile Foster doesn't usually surf on a board, he does enjoy body surfing. \"It's absolutely wonderful,\" he says. \"Going for a body surf and taking a dip after… the rush of dopamine changes your brain chemistry.\"\nKnown for gently rolling swells, Muizenberg Beach is a great place to pick up a board or play in the waves. Surf lessons are frequently offered, and the area is also suitable for kayak-surfing, something Foster says is not nearly as difficult as stand-up surfing. \"It's like being in your own little spaceship,\" he says.\nAlternatively, those looking for windsurfing or kitesurfing should head to Blouberg Beach or further up the west coast to Langebaan, a sprawling flat lagoon with consistent wind.\nDrive anywhere in Cape Town, and you're bound to pass countless cyclists pumping their legs along the photogenic backdrop of soaring peaks and a bright blue sea. While the ride across Chapman's Peak Drive may be one of the city's most famous (and for good reason – it's stunning) with a route hugging the coast, mountain biking in the trails above Cape Town's residential suburb of Tokai offers some wonderful off-roading far from cars and crowds, with views of the deep blue sea in the distance.\nFoster also recommends the \"beautiful trails through fynbos with varying levels\" with paths cutting through the Tokai Forest. Another scenic option is the Silvermine Loop, a circumnavigation with spectacular views of land and sea, which begins at the parking lot of Silvermine Dam.\n \nWinter in Cape Town happen to overlap with the beginning of whale season (roughly June to December), with False Bay providing a safe haven for cetaceans. Head out on a whale watching tour to spot migratory southern right whales, resident Bryde's whales and playful humpbacks.\nThanks to the cold, nutrient-rich waters of the Benguela current from the west and the warmer Agulhas current coming in from the east, the bay is also home to a diverse array of species, 35% of which are endemic and found nowhere else on Earth, along with pelagics and marine megafauna such as dolphins, mola mola and even orcas.\nIt'd be remiss to mention Cape Town and not some of its most famed inhabitants: the African penguin. Located within Table Mountain National Park and a wonderful day trip or family outing, Boulders Beach is a picturesque site of white granite boulders and a colony of lively penguins who congregate on the beach. Arriving sometime in the early 1980s, these flightless birds are charming, quirky and have grown to numbers of about 3,000 strong thanks to recent conservation efforts. Despite this, they are also currently endangered. \"Be sure to always give them a wide berth should they cross your path,\" says Foster. The popular site is managed by SAN Parks, with viewing platforms and meandering boardwalks, which the penguins do occasionally cross.\nHave some time to spare in your itinerary? A three-hour drive outside Cape Town, De Hoop Nature Reserve is a mecca for spotting wildlife –­ think herds of eland, bontebok and ostriches, along with plenty of birds and whale watching. With endless trails, take a hike along the vlei, a marshy wetland, and explore the rock pools at low tide. Thanks to the ban on fishing for some 30-odd years, the entire area is teeming with life.\n\"I've seen herds of elands along the ocean, along with hundreds of whales,\" Foster says. \"It's quite a privilege to visit a place with so much biodiversity on land and underwater, a place that's still intact.\"\nWebsite: https://www.dehoopcollection.com/Address: De Hoop Nature Reserve, Overberg DC, 6740Phone: +27 (0)21 4224522 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dehoopreserve/ \nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Dives are often conducted in open ocean, where groups will enter the water and await the snappers’ appearance.", "The Palau Trench — nearly 30,000 feet deep — is a trusty launch pad; in addition to the bumpheads, sailfin snapper and red snapper come to Palau to mate. Adding to the excitement are the sharks that crash the party. In 2007, Paul Collins, a pro videographer with a master’s ­degree in marine science, arrived on Palau.", "You can get within touching distance of barrel feeding giant rays - an amazing experience. ​ Check out the blog from our 2019 trip or from our 2018 trip. ​ Only in Palau can one witness the explosive event that occurs at full moon when tens of thousands of red snapper come together to spawn.", "The full Moon is a mating call for one of the ocean's most extraordinary phenomena, when thousands of red snapper gather in what can only be described as a frenzied fish orgy.\nAt 06:00, our small boat was floating a few miles from shore in the island nation of Palau, the early morning sun occasionally reflecting off the gentle curve of the waves. Eight divers were perched on the side of the boat, backs out, wetsuits on, scuba diving air valves fully open. But we were in a holding pattern, heads bobbing from both surface swells and lingering fatigue. Though ours were drooping, our captain's eyes were fixed on the point where our scuba diving guide had submerged minutes prior. The objective: locating Lutjanus bohar, commonly known as red snapper.\nBut one fish wouldn't do — we were looking for at least 1,000. Five thousand would be better.\nSuddenly, our guide's hand shot skyward, indicating he'd spotted what had brought us to this place at this time: an amorphous, ephemeral mass of snapper that regularly spawn at this particular dive site, called Shark City.\nA quick reverse count from three, and we backrolled into the water as one unit, quickly descending to 31m below the surface. The depth put us eye to bulging fish eye with one of Palau's most inexplicable marine phenomena: a snapper spawning aggregation, a breathtaking ballet of nature driven by an unknown biological code. \nHere, three days before the full Moon every month, these fish gather in what can only be described as a frenzied fish orgy. As the tide turned, the shimmering sphere of bodies grew denser, becoming roughly the size of a football field as it moved toward the surface. As if on cue, the females released their eggs, triggering a flurry of activity from the males as they darted through the massive school in a hectic attempt to maximise fertilisation — and a flurry of movement from divers as we tried to keep up with the action. We ascended with the fishy mass, not knowing where to look and attempting to clumsily adjust our underwater cameras before the influx of genetic material clouded the otherwise-clear water.\nThis weirdly specific, oddly appealing mating event likely unfolds in oceans around the world, but Palau's two sites — Shark City, and one near Peleliu Island – are the only known fixed locations where red snapper spawnings happen on a regular basis and are accessible to divers. And with recreational divers limited to depths of about 20m, and advanced divers to no more than 40m, finding spawnings is no easy task.\n\"There are probably sites like that every 10 or 20 miles but we just don't know where they are,\" said Mandy Etpison of NECO Marine dive shop in Palau's capital city of Koror. As the first PADI-certified instructor in Palau in 1985, Etpison helped pioneer the island's then-nascent dive industry and has authored several books on its ecology. She recalls that it was 2009 when a local dive shop confirmed two of the island’s best known spawning phenomena: red snapper near the full Moon at a dive site called Shark City, where we were; and bumphead parrotfish around the new Moon at a nearby site called Ulong Sandbar.\nSince then, research on reef fish behaviour has been minimal. Scientists think fertilisation coincides with the start of the outgoing current to maximise the dispersal of eggs into the open ocean. But the question of how these fish navigate this complex dance, how they pinpoint the exact time and location to spawn, remains a mystery.\n\"I don't know if there's really been any work on that yet. They get cues from the Moon, I think,\" said Christina Muller-Karanassos, who leads the fisheries research projects at Palau's International Coral Reef Research Center. \"At spawns, you get some immature fish that follow bigger fish to the site. So maybe they learn.\"\nEven the discovery of most spawning aggregations happens by accident, either based on reports from fisherman or \"just by dumb luck\", as Etpison says, as Palau dive operators look for new sites to help disperse the growing number of dive tourists. \"So it's just more eyes in the water.\"\nFor scientists, data collected during the few aggregation studies underway will guide future marine conservation efforts in Palau, a country with rare species like dugongs and ancient nautilus. In addition, scientists have found that several of the country's 700 coral species seem resistant to bleaching, which they hope to study to learn how to protect other coral species around the world.\nIn 2009, the same year the snapper and bumphead spawnings were confirmed, Palau created the world's first shark sanctuary, banning the fishing of 350 shark species in an area the size of France. In 2015, more than 80% of that area became the Palau National Marine Sanctuary (PNMS), which banned offshore fishing of any type starting a few miles offshore around Palau's islands. Currently under consideration is a fisheries management plan to tighten regulations in the water immediately offshore, which is part of the shark reserve, but not part of the sanctuary. The plan proposes measures such as complete bans on fishing specific species — like red snapper — and restrictions on fishing around known spawning grounds for three days before and after spawns occur.\n\"A lot of the time, these are also commercially important fish, and it's so easy to catch them during an aggregation. So protecting them is extremely important,\" Muller-Karanassos said. \"If you fish them all out, then you're not going to have those top predators there, so the food web will be off.\"\nWitnessing Palau's red snapper spawning aggregations are as much about luck as anything else. Though our liveaboard dive schedule was centred around the spawnings, we missed it on our first attempt, diving in about 20 minutes too early. Beforehand, we'd been taught how to use metal reef hooks to counteract the currents, but our claw-shaped hooks easily detached from their formerly secure holds in the rocky bottom each time the swells shifted direction. The spawn happens around sunrise but the precise timing can fluctuate, and the gas blends in our diving cylinders limited us to about 20 minutes at the 30m depth before we needed to begin our ascent. Fortunately, we caught the spawning on the next day's attempt.\nLuckily for us – or not, depending on one's proclivity for sharks – we were not the only voyeurs on the second day of the fishy bacchanal.\nMore like this:• Palau's world-first 'good traveller' incentive• Australia's X-rated underwater show• 10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\nThe undersea phenomenon acts as a siren song for apex predators, drawing everything from opportunistic great barracuda and common gray reef sharks to larger open-ocean species like oceanic black tip and bull sharks. \"They're just focused on the fish,\" Etpison says of bull sharks, though she cautions that divers ought not to get between them and the snapper. \nIndeed, on our spawning dive, we saw not one but two bull sharks circling on the outskirts of the action. For all we know, they were there the entire time, but we weren't able to see them through the density of fish, sperm and egg. Fortunately, they were on the opposite side of us as the spawning, closer to the open ocean.\nThat may capture the essence of diving in Palau. Thanks to the shark sanctuary and marine conservation zones, efforts like the Palau Pledge (a sustainability mandate visitors must stamp in their passports) and the continued efforts of diving operators to lobby for responsible tourism, no dive has a singular draw. A dive to a manta cleaning station will also be packed with sea turtles; a dive through an underwater cavern may include the chance to spot the natural flashing lights of the aptly named \"disco clam\". The rarity of seeing the bull sharks or a snapper spawning would be the clear highlight of a dive trip anywhere else in the world. But in Palau, it’s just another day on the reef.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

So maybe they learn.\"\nEven the discovery of most spawning aggregations happens by accident, either based on reports from fisherman or \"just by dumb luck\", as Etpison says, as Palau dive operators look for new sites to help disperse the growing number of dive tourists. \"So it's just more eyes in the water.\"\nFor scientists, data collected during the few aggregation studies underway will guide future marine conservation efforts in Palau, a country with rare species like dugongs and ancient nautilus. In addition, scientists have found that several of the country's 700 coral species seem resistant to bleaching, which they hope to study to learn how to protect other coral species around the world.\nIn 2009, the same year the snapper and bumphead spawnings were confirmed, Palau created the world's first shark sanctuary, banning the fishing of 350 shark species in an area the size of France. In 2015, more than 80% of that area became the Palau National Marine Sanctuary (PNMS), which banned offshore fishing of any type starting a few miles offshore around Palau's islands. Currently under consideration is a fisheries management plan to tighten regulations in the water immediately offshore, which is part of the shark reserve, but not part of the sanctuary. The plan proposes measures such as complete bans on fishing specific species — like red snapper — and restrictions on fishing around known spawning grounds for three days before and after spawns occur.\n\"A lot of the time, these are also commercially important fish, and it's so easy to catch them during an aggregation. So protecting them is extremely important,\" Muller-Karanassos said. \"If you fish them all out, then you're not going to have those top predators there, so the food web will be off.\"\nWitnessing Palau's red snapper spawning aggregations are as much about luck as anything else. Though our liveaboard dive schedule was centred around the spawnings, we missed it on our first attempt, diving in about 20 minutes too early. Beforehand, we'd been taught how to use metal reef hooks to counteract the currents, but our claw-shaped hooks easily detached from their formerly secure holds in the rocky bottom each time the swells shifted direction. The spawn happens around sunrise but the precise timing can fluctuate, and the gas blends in our diving cylinders limited us to about 20 minutes at the 30m depth before we needed to begin our ascent.

{"id": 517, "question": "What year did Palau create the world's first shark sanctuary?", "answer": ["2009"], "doc": ["The Palau National Marine Sanctuary ensures a vibrant future for the nation’s marine life and for its economy for years to come. In 2009, Palau created the world’s first shark sanctuary.", "While many of these nations and Guam, a United States territory, already had measures in place to protect sharks to some extent, including Palau, which created the world’s first shark sanctuary in 2009, the agreement represents a regional consensus on shark conservation standards and strategy.", "The sanctuary covers two million square miles, roughly equivalent to two-thirds of the continental United States, and is the first joint regional attempt to protect sharks. The move was approved in a joint resolution signed at the 15th Micronesian chief executive summit meeting on the Micronesian island of Pohnpei.", "The resolution opens a yearlong process to officially establish the sanctuary. It bans the harvesting of sharks and the possession and sale of shark parts throughout the island nations of Palau, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands as well as Guam.", "Commonly referred to as one of the seven underwater wonders of the world, they boast ecosystems of remarkable biodiversity, which include: Palau is again taking a leading role by moving to create a modern-day bul that puts the marine environment first. On Oct. 28, 2015, after unanimous passage in the National Congress, President Tommy E.", "The full Moon is a mating call for one of the ocean's most extraordinary phenomena, when thousands of red snapper gather in what can only be described as a frenzied fish orgy.\nAt 06:00, our small boat was floating a few miles from shore in the island nation of Palau, the early morning sun occasionally reflecting off the gentle curve of the waves. Eight divers were perched on the side of the boat, backs out, wetsuits on, scuba diving air valves fully open. But we were in a holding pattern, heads bobbing from both surface swells and lingering fatigue. Though ours were drooping, our captain's eyes were fixed on the point where our scuba diving guide had submerged minutes prior. The objective: locating Lutjanus bohar, commonly known as red snapper.\nBut one fish wouldn't do — we were looking for at least 1,000. Five thousand would be better.\nSuddenly, our guide's hand shot skyward, indicating he'd spotted what had brought us to this place at this time: an amorphous, ephemeral mass of snapper that regularly spawn at this particular dive site, called Shark City.\nA quick reverse count from three, and we backrolled into the water as one unit, quickly descending to 31m below the surface. The depth put us eye to bulging fish eye with one of Palau's most inexplicable marine phenomena: a snapper spawning aggregation, a breathtaking ballet of nature driven by an unknown biological code. \nHere, three days before the full Moon every month, these fish gather in what can only be described as a frenzied fish orgy. As the tide turned, the shimmering sphere of bodies grew denser, becoming roughly the size of a football field as it moved toward the surface. As if on cue, the females released their eggs, triggering a flurry of activity from the males as they darted through the massive school in a hectic attempt to maximise fertilisation — and a flurry of movement from divers as we tried to keep up with the action. We ascended with the fishy mass, not knowing where to look and attempting to clumsily adjust our underwater cameras before the influx of genetic material clouded the otherwise-clear water.\nThis weirdly specific, oddly appealing mating event likely unfolds in oceans around the world, but Palau's two sites — Shark City, and one near Peleliu Island – are the only known fixed locations where red snapper spawnings happen on a regular basis and are accessible to divers. And with recreational divers limited to depths of about 20m, and advanced divers to no more than 40m, finding spawnings is no easy task.\n\"There are probably sites like that every 10 or 20 miles but we just don't know where they are,\" said Mandy Etpison of NECO Marine dive shop in Palau's capital city of Koror. As the first PADI-certified instructor in Palau in 1985, Etpison helped pioneer the island's then-nascent dive industry and has authored several books on its ecology. She recalls that it was 2009 when a local dive shop confirmed two of the island’s best known spawning phenomena: red snapper near the full Moon at a dive site called Shark City, where we were; and bumphead parrotfish around the new Moon at a nearby site called Ulong Sandbar.\nSince then, research on reef fish behaviour has been minimal. Scientists think fertilisation coincides with the start of the outgoing current to maximise the dispersal of eggs into the open ocean. But the question of how these fish navigate this complex dance, how they pinpoint the exact time and location to spawn, remains a mystery.\n\"I don't know if there's really been any work on that yet. They get cues from the Moon, I think,\" said Christina Muller-Karanassos, who leads the fisheries research projects at Palau's International Coral Reef Research Center. \"At spawns, you get some immature fish that follow bigger fish to the site.

Ships only bring supplies to the village twice a year.", "Frozen in for nine months every year and located 800km from the next town, Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland, offers a fascinating glimpse at life at the edge of the world.\nIn our ever-connected world, it's rare to experience true remoteness. It's also extraordinary to witness how people live in one of the Earth's most isolated places. But earlier this year during a once-in-a-lifetime photographic expedition to the most remote inhabited community in the western hemisphere, I was able to do both these things.\nIttoqqortoormiit (pronounced: it-ockor-tormit) is a 370-person village of colourfully painted homes sandwiched between the world's largest national park to the north and the largest fjord system in the world to the south. There are no roads to Ittoqqortoormiit; the only way to get there is by helicopter, boat (in the summer), snowmobile or one of two weekly flights to Nerlerit Inaat airport, roughly 40km away: one from Iceland, and the other from West Greenland.\nLocated above the Arctic Circle at 70°N and roughly 800km from the nearest town, Ittoqqortoormiit's backyard is a frigid, untamed wilderness home to polar bears, musk oxen and millions of sea birds who nest on icebergs. Sea ice freezes the village in for nine months a year, but offers a lifeline to Ittoqqortoormiit's Inuit inhabitants, who travel it by dog sled to hunt. The village will celebrate its centenary in 2025, but in recent years, its population has been shrinking (35% since 2006, by some estimates) as young people are increasingly migrating to cities to study or pursue different careers than the traditional Arctic hunting of their forefathers. What's more, as rising temperatures cause the surrounding sea ice to freeze later and melt earlier, Ittoqqortoormiit finds itself on the front lines of climate change, which is further threatening the Indigenous community's culture.\nMy winter excursion to Ittoqqortoormiit wasn't just an adventure that took me outside my comfort zone; it was one of the most challenging experiences I've ever had. After flying from Reykjavík to Nerlerit Inaat, I spent five days on the pack ice in temperatures plummeting as low as -40C. I travelled on dogsleds, slept in tents and small hunter huts (with no beds, running water, heating or facilities) and dashed 45km on a snowmobile through a white-out blizzard with 80kmph winds.\nUltimately, this turned out to be far more than a photography expedition, as it offered a rare glimpse of life in one of the most remote landscapes on Earth. It also revealed how Ittoqqortoormiit's remaining residents are struggling to adapt their deep-rooted traditions to a rapidly changing world.\nMy trip was organised by the renowned photographer Joshua Holko, who arranged for two local Inuit guides, Åge Danielsen and Manasse Tuko, to whisk myself and two other photographers across the ice on their dog sleds from the Nerlerit Inaat airport to Ittoqqortoormiit with the aim of capturing some of Earth's most stark, stunning polar landscapes.\nWe established camp in small tents close to the airport the first night as temperatures were -30C and falling. After sawing frozen cod on the snow, as a carpenter would cut through timber, and boiling it in a pan of melted ice, Danielsen and Tuko announced that dinner was ready. The cod was excellent, if bony, but we were more concerned about what lay ahead. I had never experienced cold like this before, and as we hunkered down for the night, strong winds battered the tents while the sled dogs howled when Arctic foxes and – perhaps – polar bears passed. As the temperature continued dropping, my legs soon started to cramp. It was truly a baptism by cold.\nShortly after breakfast, Danielsen and Tuko started loading our supplies. As I watched, they expertly transformed the empty dog sleds into containers on skates filled with bags, cooler boxes, camera cases, dog food and more. They skillfully tied the goods on with ropes, demonstrating skills that they explained were passed down from father to son.\nWe sat two to a sled with a guide at the front driving the dogs. For the next six days, 12 Greenland sled dogs assigned to each sled carried loads of more than 450kg and ran their hearts out for up to 25km a day. These beloved animals (called qimmiit in Greenland's Inuit language, Kalaallisut), which are a large husky-type breed, are believed to have been brought from Siberia to Greenland some 1,000 years ago by the Inuit's direct ancestors, the Thule people, and are something of a national icon in Greenland. Not only do they represent an important part of Inuit culture and their connection to the land, but as we'd soon find, they also had the advantage of being much quieter than snowmobiles, therefore improving our chances of photographing wildlife – or, in Danielsen and Tuko's case, when they weren't guiding us, hunting wildlife.\nOne morning, after eating toast heated by spearing it with a knife and holding it over a burner, Danielsen pointed up towards the mountains as the dogs carried us 10km west of Ittoqqortoormiit. We looked up and saw four musk oxen standing on a distant ridge.\nWeighing up to 400kg, these prehistoric-looking beasts, with short horns protruding from their cheeks and long-flowing black and tan fur overcoats blowing in the strong wind, were as photogenic as they were imposing. We disembarked from the sleds and proceeded with great caution, as Holko warned us that these Ice Age relics can be skittish and aggressive: move too quickly and they will run off; get too close and they will charge. After an hour of shooting these goliaths, they started climbing higher into the mountain passes, perhaps knowing that they are regarded as a local delicacy in Ittoqqortoormiit.\nOn our third day, Danielsen mentioned that he owned a hut about 25km away and invited us to spend two nights there. We were humbled by his kindness – especially because his home was strategically positioned to spot polar bears on the pack ice. The brightly painted blue hut was just large enough for a small sofa, chair, sink, stove and a rare sit-down toilet – but the most noticeable feature was the large slaughter hook hanging from the ceiling. \nIt reminded us that whilst Danielsen may have taken on guiding to supplement his income, hunting is his passion, his profession and his ancestral tradition. By law, hunters here aren't allowed to sell meat or skins from their kills – or in the case of musk ox, import them abroad. Instead, the meat can only be used to provide food and clothing for families – just as it has for generations.\nWhile at his house, we learned that Danielsen wasn't just a proud Inuit hunter but also a father of four children. He explained that his father was a hunter, his grandfather was a hunter and he hoped his youngest son would follow in his footsteps one day. Holko had found a skull of a musk ox the previous day and gave it to Danielsen, who was elated. I asked Danielsen if I could photograph him holding the skull and he happily obliged.\nLater over dinner, we talked. \"Look at these photos,\" Danielsen said smiling, as he showed me his mobile phone. \"This is my father, yesterday.\" His father was standing over a huge polar bear lying dead on the ice. \"And look at these,\" he said with great pride, swiping through photos of three huge adult polar bears that he had killed. Due to warming temperatures over recent decades, polar bears have been forced to change their migration patterns, bringing them closer to communities like Ittoqqortoormiit and posing real dangers to people and themselves.\nFrom Danielsen's hut, we headed 20km east. As our sleds glided over the snow and ice, I marvelled at the scenery and serenity that surrounded me.\nThe light was magical; misty and moody with soft rays of sun caressing the blue-toned pack ice. We passed towering icebergs and eruptions of compacted ice that nature had sculpted into works of art. This was a landscape photographer's paradise. Being in complete darkness at night with no light pollution, the Northern Lights regularly dance through the skies on clear nights in autumn and winter. Even this phenomenon, known locally as arsarnerit (\"those who play ball\") has a connection to hunting, as the lights are believed to be the souls of children playing with a walrus skull.\nAfter five long days of travel, we arrived at Kap Hope, a small settlement of about 20 old huts 14km west of Ittoqqortoormiit with views of ice pack for miles. Exhausted and bitterly cold, the six of us unfurled sleeping bags in one of the cabins. The following morning, as he peered out of a small window with binoculars, Danielsen suddenly shouted, \"Polar bear! Polar bear!\" and pointed into the distance.\nMore like this: • The US West Coast's 'greatest footpath' • The hidden wonders of Mexico's sacred underwater world • The Middle East's once-inaccessible ancient wonder\nMy adrenaline was pumping as I thought about photographing the largest land-based carnivore on Earth – an apex predator that can smell its prey 32km away. We made our way down the side of the mountain, carefully carrying our cameras and longest lenses in heavy winter gear. The bear, 6km away, remained on the ice for 20 minutes or so before sauntering away. I had dreamed about photographing what Holko describes as the \"ghosts of the Arctic\" – polar bears whose white fur blends in so perfectly with its surroundings that they're barely visible – but this was the closest I'd come.\nThere is only one guesthouse in the western hemisphere's most remote community, and it's fittingly named Guesthouse. We were due to rest here for the next three days before flying out, and after nearly a week in the frozen wilderness, it took some time to get used to Ittoqqortoormiit. Brightly painted houses standing in deep white snow dominated the landscapes. Teams of dogs were chained to empty sleds like an Arctic taxi rank. Snowmobiles zipped around town as people went about their daily lives.\nIn recent years, Ittoqqortoormiit has been billing itself as a destination for adventurers – a place where you can cut through the ice on a boat, trek through the tundra, view icebergs and explore a part of the world that few people on the planet will ever see. But as a policeman (one of three, I was told) waved to me as he passed on his snowmobile, I no longer felt like an adventurer, but a small part of this far-flung community.\nYou can walk across Ittoqqortoormiit in about 30 minutes. It's comprised of a church, a small travel agency, a police station, a bar, a guesthouse, a heliport and a small supermarket called Pilersuisoq that's supplied by two ship deliveries each season. Wandering the sparsely stocked aisles, I was struck by the high cost of everything. I wondered how, in a place where there were few jobs, locals could afford these prices.\nOutside, the polar bear skins hanging on scaffolding near so many houses reminded me of this community's origins. I'd embarked on this adventure to capture unique images of wildlife. And while the \"ghosts of the Arctic\" eluded me on this occasion, it didn't matter, as I'd gained a far greater appreciation for how people managed to live in one of the remotest places on Earth.\nKevin Hall is a photographer based in England.

The brightly painted blue hut was just large enough for a small sofa, chair, sink, stove and a rare sit-down toilet – but the most noticeable feature was the large slaughter hook hanging from the ceiling. \nIt reminded us that whilst Danielsen may have taken on guiding to supplement his income, hunting is his passion, his profession and his ancestral tradition. By law, hunters here aren't allowed to sell meat or skins from their kills – or in the case of musk ox, import them abroad. Instead, the meat can only be used to provide food and clothing for families – just as it has for generations.\nWhile at his house, we learned that Danielsen wasn't just a proud Inuit hunter but also a father of four children. He explained that his father was a hunter, his grandfather was a hunter and he hoped his youngest son would follow in his footsteps one day. Holko had found a skull of a musk ox the previous day and gave it to Danielsen, who was elated. I asked Danielsen if I could photograph him holding the skull and he happily obliged.\nLater over dinner, we talked. \"Look at these photos,\" Danielsen said smiling, as he showed me his mobile phone. \"This is my father, yesterday.\" His father was standing over a huge polar bear lying dead on the ice. \"And look at these,\" he said with great pride, swiping through photos of three huge adult polar bears that he had killed. Due to warming temperatures over recent decades, polar bears have been forced to change their migration patterns, bringing them closer to communities like Ittoqqortoormiit and posing real dangers to people and themselves.\nFrom Danielsen's hut, we headed 20km east. As our sleds glided over the snow and ice, I marvelled at the scenery and serenity that surrounded me.\nThe light was magical; misty and moody with soft rays of sun caressing the blue-toned pack ice. We passed towering icebergs and eruptions of compacted ice that nature had sculpted into works of art. This was a landscape photographer's paradise. Being in complete darkness at night with no light pollution, the Northern Lights regularly dance through the skies on clear nights in autumn and winter. Even this phenomenon, known locally as arsarnerit (\"those who play ball\") has a connection to hunting, as the lights are believed to be the souls of children playing with a walrus skull.\nAfter five long days of travel, we arrived at Kap Hope, a small settlement of about 20 old huts 14km west of Ittoqqortoormiit with views of ice pack for miles. Exhausted and bitterly cold, the six of us unfurled sleeping bags in one of the cabins. The following morning, as he peered out of a small window with binoculars, Danielsen suddenly shouted, \"Polar bear! Polar bear!\" and pointed into the distance.\nMore like this: • The US West Coast's 'greatest footpath' • The hidden wonders of Mexico's sacred underwater world • The Middle East's once-inaccessible ancient wonder\nMy adrenaline was pumping as I thought about photographing the largest land-based carnivore on Earth – an apex predator that can smell its prey 32km away. We made our way down the side of the mountain, carefully carrying our cameras and longest lenses in heavy winter gear. The bear, 6km away, remained on the ice for 20 minutes or so before sauntering away. I had dreamed about photographing what Holko describes as the \"ghosts of the Arctic\" – polar bears whose white fur blends in so perfectly with its surroundings that they're barely visible – but this was the closest I'd come.\nThere is only one guesthouse in the western hemisphere's most remote community, and it's fittingly named Guesthouse. We were due to rest here for the next three days before flying out, and after nearly a week in the frozen wilderness, it took some time to get used to Ittoqqortoormiit. Brightly painted houses standing in deep white snow dominated the landscapes. Teams of dogs were chained to empty sleds like an Arctic taxi rank. Snowmobiles zipped around town as people went about their daily lives.\nIn recent years, Ittoqqortoormiit has been billing itself as a destination for adventurers – a place where you can cut through the ice on a boat, trek through the tundra, view icebergs and explore a part of the world that few people on the planet will ever see. But as a policeman (one of three, I was told) waved to me as he passed on his snowmobile, I no longer felt like an adventurer, but a small part of this far-flung community.\nYou can walk across Ittoqqortoormiit in about 30 minutes. It's comprised of a church, a small travel agency, a police station, a bar, a guesthouse, a heliport and a small supermarket called Pilersuisoq that's supplied by two ship deliveries each season. Wandering the sparsely stocked aisles, I was struck by the high cost of everything. I wondered how, in a place where there were few jobs, locals could afford these prices.\nOutside, the polar bear skins hanging on scaffolding near so many houses reminded me of this community's origins. I'd embarked on this adventure to capture unique images of wildlife. And while the \"ghosts of the Arctic\" eluded me on this occasion, it didn't matter, as I'd gained a far greater appreciation for how people managed to live in one of the remotest places on Earth.\nKevin Hall is a photographer based in England.

{"id": 520, "question": "What is the length of the East Royal Road in Cambodia?", "answer": ["100km"], "doc": ["There were five Royal Roads connecting the capital city of Angkor to provincial cities: Preah Khan of Kompong Svay (East Royal Road) and Sambor Prei Kuk (Southeast Royal Road) in Cambodia, Phimai (Northwest Royal Road) and Sdok Kok Thom (West Royal Road) in Thailand, and Wat Phu in Laos (Northeast Royal Road) (Fig. 1) [8].", "The sizes of the bridges vary, but many bridges are 10 to 30 m in length and 6 to 10 m in width. The largest bridge along the East Royal Road is Spean Ta Ong (no. 319, according to the Carte Interactive des Sites Archéologiques Khmers (CISARK; http://cisark.mcfa.gov.", "Filled with ancient bridges, little-known temples and plenty of off-road adventure, Cambodia's East Royal Road reveals a unique side of the illustrious Khmer Empire.\nI set off in a minivan the morning of my birthday and ended up on the back of a dirt bike clutching a Cambodian man I'd never met before.\nAt 07:00, I had alighted from the wrought iron lift at Raffles Grand Hotel d'Angkor Siem Riep, much as I imagined Jackie Kennedy had done during her visit here in 1967, and met my guide, Pheakdey \"Dey\" Sieng from the tour operator About Asia. I'd come to Siem Reap to explore the East Royal Road, a 100km route that links the ancient temples of Angkor Wat, Beng Mealea and Preah Khan Kompong Svay. The Khmer Empire, which ruled much of Southeast Asia from 802-1431 CE, is famed for its temples, but much of its power came from the 3,000km road system stretching from its historical capital, Angkor, to the far reaches of its realm in modern-day Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar.\nWhile there were five royal roads that linked the capital with its provincial cities, the East Royal Road not only has the largest collection of intact Khmer infrastructure (including bridges, ponds, walls and embankments), but also resthouse temples that aren't found on other roads where pilgrims could eat, pray and sleep. The road was also used to transport the stones used to build the Khmer temples and the iron that was made into weaponry to defend them. The Khmer were known for their sophisticated irrigation systems, and the road is lined with ancient laterite bridges – most of which are still in use – that cross over rivers and streams.\nThe route is considered a classic road trip for dirt bikers and temple enthusiasts alike, and just before I arrived, Prime Minister Hun Manet nominated Beng Mealea and Preah Khan for inclusion as Unesco World Heritage sites. With interest in these sites expected to grow in the coming years, I wanted to see them while they were still under the radar.\nThere was only one problem: the heat was searing. Travellers are advised against coming to Siem Reap in April as it's hotter than Hades, and this particular week, there was a heatwave with temperatures reaching topping 40C, with a UV index of 12 on a scale of 1-11+.\nDey's plan was to visit Preah Khan first and then continue to Beng Mealea before returning to Siem Reap, leaving Angkor for another day. Departing Siem Reap on the ancient earthen road (now largely tracing the paved Highway 6), our first stop, Kampong Kdei, was an 86m bridge supported by 21 arches built during the 12th-Century reign of Jayavarman VII, the greatest and most ambitious Khmer ruler. The rust-coloured bridge, which graces Cambodia's 5,000 Riel banknote, has striking balustrades in the form of a nine-headed naga: the mythical half-human, half-serpent representing water and fertility that's popular in Khmer artwork.\n\"Welcome to free massage road,\" Dey said, as we turned onto a bumpy, dirt path. I wondered what kind of massages he gets, since I felt like I was being dropped repeatedly from a second-floor window. Still an hour from Preah Khan and now off the highway, a more bucolic view of Cambodia emerged. Cement homes were replaced by wooden houses on stilts. A baby calf and her mother ambled across the dusty road and naked toddlers took a break from roughhousing to smile and wave. According to Dey, the villagers are primarily farmers who grow cashews, cassava and rice.\nBones thoroughly rattled, we arrived at Preah Khan. Unlike Angkor Wat which welcomes thousands of visitors a day, few travellers make it to Preah Khan, and as a fellow tourist and I smiled at each other in passing, it felt as if we were in on a secret.\nDey explained that this was the empire's most looted temple, having been plundered by French explorers in the 19th Century and locals in the 20th. In places, the temple looked like a giant game of Jenga, but it was also a menagerie filled with carved three-headed stone swans, garudas (divine birds), elephants and nagas. We stopped at the restored 9.5m-high statue, Preah Chahtomukh, carved with four smiling Buddhas facing each cardinal direction. The sublime sight of the serene, enigmatic faces carved into massive stone towers awed me, and I could see why fellow travellers call them \"the Mona Lisas of Southeast Asia\".\nMore like this:• The Overseas Highway: The US' 'floating' highway• A road trip through the roof of the Americas• The road that's the 'Eighth World Wonder'\nLunch was a delicious meal of rice and dried fish in a thatched hut at a local restaurant. \"This stretch would be better on a dirt bike,\" Dey said, before explaining that the road from Preah Khan to the village of Khvav can only be navigated by off-road motorcycles and oxcarts. Fortunately, he just happened to know two men who'd be happy to take us. I thought of \"the birthday effect\", which says that, statistically speaking, your risk of dying is higher on or near your birthday. Riding on the back of a dirt bike along a dusty path rutted by oxcarts in sweltering weather probably wouldn't help my odds.\nMy dirt bike driver, Mr Cheat, looked concerned as I clambered onto the back of his bike and clenched the grab rail. Dey, who'd been quite serious, broke into a mischievous grin. The engine sputtered and we were off. Careening through the jungle, we dodged trenches and low-hanging tree boughs. We whizzed with exhilaration past forests, fields and the occasional tractor on tightly packed clay pathways before stopping on the side of the road to wander rarely seen ruins.\nThe road from Preah Khan to Beng Mealea is lined with rest stops called \"firehouses\" and the slightly larger resthouse temples. Historians disagree on whether either of these stopping places were religious, secular or both, and because of their inaccessibility, little research has been done on them to date.\nWe stopped at Sopheap Tbong which mirrors the design of all resthouses: an outer wall with a large gate leading to a central hallway flanked by two galleries. Peering through askew windows into a narrow room, I imagined ancient travellers and pilgrims seeking reprieve from their long journeys through the vast Khmer Empire. Since it was believed that the average Khmer traveller could cover 30km per day, these resthouses were placed 15km apart to allow for mid-day and evening stops. \nPrasat Pram, another resthouse, is mostly an array of vine-strangled rocks, but a detached window revealed the carved pillars that served as Khmer window blinds. While I cursed the temperature, I was grateful that the roads were dry, as navigating through wet oxcart ruts would have been treacherous. Before we drove off, I asked Dey why we hadn't seen any oxcarts. He replied, \"It's too hot for the ox.\"\nBack on the bike, I gripped Mr Cheat's shoulders. \"One more temple\", Dey said. Twenty minutes later, I was lumbering over the fallen laterite blocks of the ruined fire shrine, Prasat Ta En, before pausing to take a breath. This was a reststop after all. Leaves rustled and I inhaled the herbaceous fragrance of the trees as the sun peeked through the forest canopy. Without intervention, this site will fade from memory. Except for a few jutting pieces of stone, nature's reclamation was nearly complete.\nWe then drove to our final bridge, Spean Ta Ong, which offered a welcome respite from the rutted roads. At more than 70m long, the ornately carved bridge is as impressive as it is beautiful, especially with its naga balustrades glowing burnt sienna in the late afternoon light.\nPulling into Khvav, my 30km dirt bike adventure ended. I bid Mr Cheat farewell and climbed back into my air-conditioned chariot with Dey. We were 20km from Bang Mealea, which closed in 15 minutes. We pulled up late, but after Dey slipped $5 to a guide enjoying an after-hours beer, we entered Beng Mealea and had it all to ourselves. \nConstructed at the same time as Angkor Wat, many believe Beng Mealea was a prototype for the capitol. The temple is mysterious, romantic and virtually untouched. Silk cotton trees entwine the stone ruins, their roots splaying across the ground like the greedy claws of a giant lizard, while menacing strangler figs look like they're trying to burrow into the earth to reclaim their rightful place in the underworld.\nLittered about the grounds are large piles of sandstone blocks, many decorated with intricate carvings. We followed winding wooden walkways through the ruins (which, it turns out, were built for the set of the 2004 film Two Brothers, starring Guy Pierce). Amidst the rubble on a wall, there was a moss-covered masterpiece: the Churning of the Ocean of Milk, a scene from a Hindu legend depicting a tug-of-war between gods and demons for the elixir of immortality.After an hour, we were back in Siem Reap and stopped by the offices of About Asia where, in my mud-spattered state, I chatted with Silen Truy, one of Siem Reap’s few female guides.

Riding on the back of a dirt bike along a dusty path rutted by oxcarts in sweltering weather probably wouldn't help my odds.\nMy dirt bike driver, Mr Cheat, looked concerned as I clambered onto the back of his bike and clenched the grab rail. Dey, who'd been quite serious, broke into a mischievous grin. The engine sputtered and we were off. Careening through the jungle, we dodged trenches and low-hanging tree boughs. We whizzed with exhilaration past forests, fields and the occasional tractor on tightly packed clay pathways before stopping on the side of the road to wander rarely seen ruins.\nThe road from Preah Khan to Beng Mealea is lined with rest stops called \"firehouses\" and the slightly larger resthouse temples. Historians disagree on whether either of these stopping places were religious, secular or both, and because of their inaccessibility, little research has been done on them to date.\nWe stopped at Sopheap Tbong which mirrors the design of all resthouses: an outer wall with a large gate leading to a central hallway flanked by two galleries. Peering through askew windows into a narrow room, I imagined ancient travellers and pilgrims seeking reprieve from their long journeys through the vast Khmer Empire. Since it was believed that the average Khmer traveller could cover 30km per day, these resthouses were placed 15km apart to allow for mid-day and evening stops. \nPrasat Pram, another resthouse, is mostly an array of vine-strangled rocks, but a detached window revealed the carved pillars that served as Khmer window blinds. While I cursed the temperature, I was grateful that the roads were dry, as navigating through wet oxcart ruts would have been treacherous. Before we drove off, I asked Dey why we hadn't seen any oxcarts. He replied, \"It's too hot for the ox.\"\nBack on the bike, I gripped Mr Cheat's shoulders. \"One more temple\", Dey said. Twenty minutes later, I was lumbering over the fallen laterite blocks of the ruined fire shrine, Prasat Ta En, before pausing to take a breath. This was a reststop after all. Leaves rustled and I inhaled the herbaceous fragrance of the trees as the sun peeked through the forest canopy. Without intervention, this site will fade from memory. Except for a few jutting pieces of stone, nature's reclamation was nearly complete.\nWe then drove to our final bridge, Spean Ta Ong, which offered a welcome respite from the rutted roads. At more than 70m long, the ornately carved bridge is as impressive as it is beautiful, especially with its naga balustrades glowing burnt sienna in the late afternoon light.\nPulling into Khvav, my 30km dirt bike adventure ended. I bid Mr Cheat farewell and climbed back into my air-conditioned chariot with Dey. We were 20km from Bang Mealea, which closed in 15 minutes. We pulled up late, but after Dey slipped $5 to a guide enjoying an after-hours beer, we entered Beng Mealea and had it all to ourselves. \nConstructed at the same time as Angkor Wat, many believe Beng Mealea was a prototype for the capitol. The temple is mysterious, romantic and virtually untouched. Silk cotton trees entwine the stone ruins, their roots splaying across the ground like the greedy claws of a giant lizard, while menacing strangler figs look like they're trying to burrow into the earth to reclaim their rightful place in the underworld.\nLittered about the grounds are large piles of sandstone blocks, many decorated with intricate carvings. We followed winding wooden walkways through the ruins (which, it turns out, were built for the set of the 2004 film Two Brothers, starring Guy Pierce). Amidst the rubble on a wall, there was a moss-covered masterpiece: the Churning of the Ocean of Milk, a scene from a Hindu legend depicting a tug-of-war between gods and demons for the elixir of immortality.After an hour, we were back in Siem Reap and stopped by the offices of About Asia where, in my mud-spattered state, I chatted with Silen Truy, one of Siem Reap’s few female guides. When I asked her why she wasn't my guide, she laughed and said, \"The dirt bike. That's man stuff.\"\nI returned to Raffles looking more like Bear Grylls than Jackie Kennedy. Thorns jutted from my hair; dirt outlined where my glasses had been; and when I took off my socks, my legs were 12 shades darker than my ashen feet. It was the best birthday ever.\nThe Open Road is a celebration of the world's most remarkable highways and byways, and a reminder that some of the greatest travel adventures happen via wheels.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Welcome to Cataract Canyon.\nThe muddy current of the Colorado River carries our rafts through the red rock walls of Cataract Canyon in southern Utah's Canyonlands National Park. The roar of a rapid grows louder somewhere downstream. Before we reach the tumultuous churn, the rafts pull up to a small white-sand beach. Beyond, the towering walls pull back to make room for a wide drainage, called a side canyon, where Gypsum Creek trundles in to the meet the river. We'll pitch our tents here, in this remote and wild spot, and sleep under the glittering stars before continuing on tomorrow.\nIt sounds like a typical river trip. Until you factor in that as recently as 10 years ago, all of this was 60ft underneath the still water of Lake Powell, the huge reservoir created when the doors of Glen Canyon Dam closed in 1963 to store water for the dry and quickly growing Western states. The reservoir flooded 186 miles of the Colorado River and scores of its side canyons, and buried all of it in thick layers of sediment that dropped from the river as the current slowed on its way into Powell.\nBut in the last decade, Powell's level has dropped steeply – a result of overuse by the 40 million people who rely on the Colorado River for water, as well as less precipitation making its way down the watershed as the climate changes. \nBut there's a silver lining to those gloomy circumstances: as the reservoir recedes, the Colorado has room to flow freely again, carving through the giant dam-deposited sediment plug and restoring itself, mile by mile.\nThis beach only came into existence earlier this year. The spot where we set up our kitchen was formerly the subsurface centre of a calm bay two football fields across. Before 2023, the rapid downstream – one in a succession of fierce torrents that made Cataract Canyon one of the most fearsome whitewater stretches in the country – hadn't been seen in my lifetime. In all, 10 of Cataract's historic rapids have re-emerged, and more are likely on their way.\nI'm on a raft trip with the Returning Rapids Project that's documenting the changes happening here as the river restores itself. Two of the Project's founders, Mike DeHoff and Pete Lefebvre, were river guides back when the reservoir was full; Lefebvre still guides trips down this stretch. Both say that rafting Cataract at this unique point in history is an experience both precious and exceedingly rare: the opportunity to witness the return of an entire landscape on a large scale. A canyon nearly as beautiful as the Grand Canyon just 31 miles away, cultural and historical sites, some of the most storied whitewater on the biggest river in the American West – it's all emerging for the first time since humans flooded it two generations ago.\nThings are changing so fast here that each trip down Cataract today is an expedition of re-discovery of what was lost. It's a journey through the scene of leftover human impact on a vast scale and an illustration in real time of the power of nature to recover from that impact.\nEarly boating expeditions viewed Cataract's 41 miles of river punctuated with more than 50 fierce rapids with trepidation. \"A lot of the historic photos we find show wooden boats that are pinned or flipped or damaged,\" said Meg Flynn, a librarian and co-founder of Returning Rapids who focuses on archival documentation of the river. \"That earned Cataract Canyon the nickname 'Graveyard of the Colorado'.\"\nWhen John Wesley Powell, leader of an early expedition to map the river, ran this stretch in 1869, he and his men carried their boats and gear \"around nearly every rapid, which he deemed no ordinary rapids, but great waterfalls, or cataracts\", wrote Melissa L Sevigny in Brave the Wild River. \"By 1911, the stretch had only been run successfully four times, and seven other parties had attempted it and been deemed lost.\"\nLater, when rubber rafts were popularised, Cataract became a beloved stretch of adrenaline-pumping whitewater for adventure seekers, celebrated as some of the most challenging whitewater in the country – even more so than the Grand Canyon, some river devotees will say.\nLake Powell drowned more than half of those rapids. At the turn of this century, a guided trip down Cataract Canyon meant rafting just 14 miles of whitewater that ended abruptly after a formidable rapid called Big Drop Three. From there, guides attached motors to rafts to take guests the rest of the way on flat lake water shared with houseboats, motorboats and water skiers, every trace of the wild river vanished as if it had never existed.\nThe following morning, we gear up to run Gypsum Rapid. Since Big Drop Three, we've rafted several resurrected rapids, but none as big as this one. In 1938, one expedition related that in approaching Gypsum, the river simply disappeared over a horizon line like a waterfall. On the other side hid an enormous standing wave that flipped boats end over end. As recently as 2017, Gypsum was still dormant under flat water, the boulders and steep gradient that made it so savage buried under two storeys worth of mud backed up by the dam.\nBy 2023, Gypsum had emerged to nearly its former power. As the river speeds our raft toward it, I can see the strong current exploding over a boulder the size of a small bus in the centre. My heart speeds up.

I can see signs of where beavers had slid into the river, and hear songbirds ­– all native species that have returned as the floodwaters ebbed. We beach the rafts and hike up to a petroglyph (an ancient rock drawing) that's re-emerged in recent years. Flynn is hoping to locate another historical marker downstream that she predicts will come up for air this season or next: \"a billboard\", she calls it, where early expeditions carved their names on a large rock as a sort of \"we survived Cataract Canyon\" marker. \nMore like this:• The UK's unique, circular hike where accommodation is just £20• The Erie Canal: The manmade waterway that transformed the US• The Pacific Crest Trail: The US West Coast's 'greatest footpath'\nWe stop for lunch at a side canyon called Clearwater. DeHoff and LeFebvre recall when boats could motor for 15 minutes up this canyon on the high waters of Powell. Now we hike up it on foot, along a trickling creek lined with desert flowers. As we walk, Lefebvre tells me that river guides have begun using the field notes that Returning Rapids compiles each year to document changes, point out landmarks that have emerged and bring these environmental miracles of restoration to the attention of their guests. \nIt's easy to think, with such lovely hallmarks of the river's recovery, that the Colorado River will turn the tables: restore itself as Lake Powell drops until all traces of the reservoir vanish.\nBut then there's all the mud.\nIt becomes more prominent the further we travel downriver: half a century's worth of sediment with nowhere to go except slammed up against the dam. The current is scouring it out of the river channel, but walls of dried sediment line the banks. Near Gypsum, they're 20ft high. Past Clearwater, they're 50ft, unstable and often collapsing into the river in otherworldly avalanches. Before it dries, the mud is so unconsolidated that it can make finding a campsite on the lower reaches of Cataract a difficult and messy proposition. The mud is the reminder that the river can't fully restore itself without human intervention from the US government agencies who manage this land. As of yet, though, there's no plan for dealing with all this displaced sediment.\nZack Sam, a river guide with OARS who regularly leads trips down Cataract, calls this stretch of the Colorado below Lake Powell \"more raw, more wild than the Grand Canyon\". \"Cataract is a very dynamic environment,\" he said. \"You go through it one week, and it's already changing the next. No two trips are the same.\"\nAdd in the elements of the river restoring itself – mud rapids have appeared and disappeared from all the sludge moving downstream, new beaches form and old ones slump away – and \"there's a sense of adventure special only to Cataract Canyon\", he said.\nMost experts agree that Lake Powell will never refill again in this era of climate change, and will, instead, likely continue to drop. More rapids will return. More stories from our past will re-surface. And a trip down Cataract will, for many years to come, hold so much more wonder than a typical jaunt down a desert river.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

As of yet, though, there's no plan for dealing with all this displaced sediment.\nZack Sam, a river guide with OARS who regularly leads trips down Cataract, calls this stretch of the Colorado below Lake Powell \"more raw, more wild than the Grand Canyon\". \"Cataract is a very dynamic environment,\" he said. \"You go through it one week, and it's already changing the next. No two trips are the same.\"\nAdd in the elements of the river restoring itself – mud rapids have appeared and disappeared from all the sludge moving downstream, new beaches form and old ones slump away – and \"there's a sense of adventure special only to Cataract Canyon\", he said.\nMost experts agree that Lake Powell will never refill again in this era of climate change, and will, instead, likely continue to drop. More rapids will return. More stories from our past will re-surface. And a trip down Cataract will, for many years to come, hold so much more wonder than a typical jaunt down a desert river.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

I took in a lungful of fresh mountain air, half-wondering how on earth the Walser people managed to walk this same steep trail with their livestock and worldly possessions, and pushed further along the ancient mule track that led up and out of the Binna Valley beyond the tiny hamlet of Fald.\nI was in Switzerland to tackle the first stages of the newly inaugurated 210km Walserweg Gottardo long-distance hiking trail, which officially opened in May 2024. While the natural beauty of the trail is enough to attract hikers from across the world, the route has a deeper purpose. It seeks to unravel some of the region's most intriguing human history: the little-known story of the Walser, who migrated through the Alps from Valais to Grisons for still unknown reasons during the 12th to the 14th Centuries.\nPredominantly shepherds, cattle breeders and subsistence farmers, the Walser have long been an under-appreciated part of Swiss culture. They are indigenous to the Canton of Valais in south-western Switzerland, but now mostly live at altitudes just below the High Alps, so-named because their extreme height makes permanent human habitation impossible.\nThe High Alps have traditionally not been celebrated but feared. The Romans, known for their military might and impressive engineering feats, called the area terra maledicta or \"cursed earth\". Nevertheless, the zone immediately below the High Alps is exactly where the Walser migrated, founding small settlements further and further east on multiple occasions over many generations.\nWhat makes the Walser's ancient decision to migrate eastward so interesting is that the reasons behind their migrations, or Walserwanderungen, remain uncertain, even to the Walser themselves. Both overpopulation of the Upper Valais and forced migration by feudal landlords have been suggested.\n\"When I was in primary school [in the 1960s], they told us it was because the people had been hungry and went somewhere else where nobody lived so they were able to stay there,\" Andreas Weissen, a local guidebook author told me. \"Historians now say it was a programme of settlement [of previously uninhabited land].\"\nToday there are a few thousand Walser, inhabiting around 150 individual villages mostly situated along the new trail's route and maintaining a distinct culture and language. They speak a dialect of German largely unintelligible to Standard German speakers and live in small communities of traditional vernacular wooden \"Walserhaus\" homes in the remote mountains. Sometimes called \"colonies\", these settlements reach all the way to Grisons, Switzerland's easternmost canton, and as far north as Lichtenstein.\nDespite their geographic spread, the Walser are aware their smallholder culture, developed through necessity due to their historic isolation, is at risk of disappearing. Many of their characteristics and traditions are intangible in nature. The Walser can't be distinguished by their citizenship, dress, physical appearance or religious faith, meaning traditions are lost when Walser move from the Alps in search of employment or marry into non-Walser families.\n\"It's just the strength to be who we are, to be different, to fight against the weather, the cold, and even be happy about it,\" said Karin Tomamichel of the Walserhaus Museum, when I asked her what defines them as a people.\nThe new trail, created with the full support of Walser communities, is a way of keeping the culture alive by sharing their story with a wider number of people, even as Walser populations in settlements decline.  \nThe route starts in Valais and follows their historic migration route, linking a variety of sights and locations that help reveal the Walser's history and culture, including villages, restaurants/bistros serving up hearty Walser cuisine and the Walserhaus Museum in the town of Bosco Gurin.\nI'd decided to tackle the trail's first five stages, which saw me cover 67km of the trail, from the Walser's ancestral home of the village of Binn in Valais, where some Walser still live amid narrow, car-free paths that lead between chalet-style blockbau homes, recognisable by stacks of horizontal logs interconnected at the corners atop a stone cellar.\nToday, Valais is known for its French-speaking majority, and while there are few physical reminders of the Walser in the canton, the historical connections can be seen in other ways. For instance, \"Walser\" is a contraction of the word \"Walliser\", meaning \"inhabitant of Valais\" in the Walser German dialect of Walsertitsch, hinting at more complex linguistic and cultural origins in the canton.\nFrom Binn, the trail makes use of the lowest pass through the mountains, the desolate 2,409m-high Albrunpass. To reach it, just as the Walser did centuries ago, I climbed steadily on ancient here-and-gone-again tracks and through pasture studded with hidden marmot burrows into larch forest spongy underfoot from endless seasons of fallen needles.\nDuring the 20km, seven-hour ascent, I encountered only a handful of other walkers and no more than a smattering of isolated homes. Snow continued to lie knee-deep in gullies just beside the marked route and the silence of the surroundings was only broken by the occasional few bars of birdsong until I reached the relative energy of Italy's Val Formazza, the location of the first Walser settlements south of the Alps.\nThrough their ongoing migrations, the Walser were the first to inhabit the region permanently, turning hunting areas and summer pasture into year-round settlements formed primary of smallholdings. Its arguably the region's continued isolation – the Val Formazza's village of Crampiolo still can't be reached by road and can be cut off for months over winter due to heavy snowfall – that has helped Walser culture to survive for so long.\nDespite being socially conservative at heart, their migrations resulted in freedoms almost revolutionary for the period. In exchange for permanently settling the upper slopes, the Walser were able to obtain several new customary rights from landowners that most societies lacked. Called Walserrecht, they included full liberty from feudalism, the entitlement to pass inheritance on to heirs and the establishment of \"mayors\" elected by their communities to enforce law and order, something usually done by landlords elsewhere in Switzerland at that time. Their migrations also led to inventions such as the Rittbrätt, a forerunner of the snowboard.\nTypical of the small Walser settlements I passed through was Riale, known in Walsertitsch as Chärbach. Here, I counted no more than a dozen buildings and a hilltop chapel wedded to the flat ground of the River Toce's narrow floodplain and hemmed in by peaks still capped with snow. Each was a solidly built blockbau construction with a roof of heavy roughhewn tiles shaped from local gneiss rock.\nRiale had an almost-abandoned air so early in the hiking season, with just a couple of dog walkers and a single parked car. Even so, its two small guesthouses advertised menus packed with calorie-laden Walser specialities for energy-expending smallholders, such as Bettelmatt (a type of hard cow's milk cheese), gnocchi Walser (potato gnocchi with bacon) and Prata Hapfla (potato pancakes). It was hard to find businesses that weren't keeping Walser culture alive.\nIt was equally hard to conceive of there being any route out of valley over the mountains, given that I was hemmed in on either side with slopes seemingly too steep to tackle. Yet as early as the 13th Century, the Walser did just that, crossing the Alps to the east of Val Formazza via the Hendar Furggu Pass to found Bosco Gurin.\nTheir migration to the only German-speaking settlement in Switzerland's Italian-majority canton of Ticino, is echoed by stage five of the Walserweg Gottardo.\nTo counter the precipitous inclines, the stage had me zigzagging from Val Formazza through shady larch forest. The trees opened out into Alpine pasture and onto the shores of Lake Superiore, reflecting nearby peaks in its still waters and sending a glacial chill through the air. Bosco Gurin's Walserhaus ethnographic museum, housed in one of the oldest surviving structures in the Alps, dating to 1386, came into view several hours of uninterrupted walking later.\nMore like this:• A new chance to hike Europe's ancient salt route• An award-winning 1,400km hike into the wilds of Eastern Europe• France's centuries-old mountain farm stays\nWaiting for me as I tackled the last steps of the stage along flagstones forming the village's pedestrian-only paths, polished with generations of wear, were Tomamichel and the Walserhaus's curator, Cristina Lessman Della Pietra, both of whom come from Walser families.\nSpeaking with passion, their pride in their unique cultural heritage was obvious, but they were also very aware that it's at risk of vanishing. The reason the museum was founded was to \"assure Walser history by gathering everything in one place\", Lessman Della Pietra said. Founded in 1938 by an association of Walser people, its rooms are packed with everyday articles that are now anything but every day, from hand-carved cradles to an antique loom still used by a colleague of Tomamichel and Lessman Della Pietra to make cloth.\nFor many, it's the language that defines the Walser, given the limited intelligibility between Walsertitsch, Swiss German speakers and Standard German speakers due to hundreds of years of the Walser's isolated living. \"The language is an aspect that is going to disappear,\" warned Tomamichel. \"She [Cristina] speaks it but I don't even if I grew up here because my mum was from Ticino, from another village where they spoke Italian.\"\nCompounding the issue is contemporary migration, as Walser families move away from their traditional settlements to find greater opportunities in larger towns and cities. \"I can imagine that many people, if they have to choose between an easy life and cultural values, they choose the easy life,\" conceded Tomamichel. Where Bosco Gurin was home to 400 permanent residents in the mid-19th Century, today there are 50.\nThe hope is that the creation of the Walserweg Gottardo and the arrival of hikers will help maintain the Walser's culture for years to come by providing new employment opportunities that encourage Walser people to stay. The presence of several young families, including Tomamichel's, gives hope for the future of Walser settlements like Bosco Gurin.\n\"I care about my culture, my roots,\" Tomamichel told me. \"I grew up here and it feels natural to maintain it. The Walserweg Gottardo will help us do that.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

The Romans, known for their military might and impressive engineering feats, called the area terra maledicta or \"cursed earth\". Nevertheless, the zone immediately below the High Alps is exactly where the Walser migrated, founding small settlements further and further east on multiple occasions over many generations.\nWhat makes the Walser's ancient decision to migrate eastward so interesting is that the reasons behind their migrations, or Walserwanderungen, remain uncertain, even to the Walser themselves. Both overpopulation of the Upper Valais and forced migration by feudal landlords have been suggested.\n\"When I was in primary school [in the 1960s], they told us it was because the people had been hungry and went somewhere else where nobody lived so they were able to stay there,\" Andreas Weissen, a local guidebook author told me. \"Historians now say it was a programme of settlement [of previously uninhabited land].\"\nToday there are a few thousand Walser, inhabiting around 150 individual villages mostly situated along the new trail's route and maintaining a distinct culture and language. They speak a dialect of German largely unintelligible to Standard German speakers and live in small communities of traditional vernacular wooden \"Walserhaus\" homes in the remote mountains. Sometimes called \"colonies\", these settlements reach all the way to Grisons, Switzerland's easternmost canton, and as far north as Lichtenstein.\nDespite their geographic spread, the Walser are aware their smallholder culture, developed through necessity due to their historic isolation, is at risk of disappearing. Many of their characteristics and traditions are intangible in nature. The Walser can't be distinguished by their citizenship, dress, physical appearance or religious faith, meaning traditions are lost when Walser move from the Alps in search of employment or marry into non-Walser families.\n\"It's just the strength to be who we are, to be different, to fight against the weather, the cold, and even be happy about it,\" said Karin Tomamichel of the Walserhaus Museum, when I asked her what defines them as a people.\nThe new trail, created with the full support of Walser communities, is a way of keeping the culture alive by sharing their story with a wider number of people, even as Walser populations in settlements decline.  \nThe route starts in Valais and follows their historic migration route, linking a variety of sights and locations that help reveal the Walser's history and culture, including villages, restaurants/bistros serving up hearty Walser cuisine and the Walserhaus Museum in the town of Bosco Gurin.\nI'd decided to tackle the trail's first five stages, which saw me cover 67km of the trail, from the Walser's ancestral home of the village of Binn in Valais, where some Walser still live amid narrow, car-free paths that lead between chalet-style blockbau homes, recognisable by stacks of horizontal logs interconnected at the corners atop a stone cellar.\nToday, Valais is known for its French-speaking majority, and while there are few physical reminders of the Walser in the canton, the historical connections can be seen in other ways. For instance, \"Walser\" is a contraction of the word \"Walliser\", meaning \"inhabitant of Valais\" in the Walser German dialect of Walsertitsch, hinting at more complex linguistic and cultural origins in the canton.\nFrom Binn, the trail makes use of the lowest pass through the mountains, the desolate 2,409m-high Albrunpass. To reach it, just as the Walser did centuries ago, I climbed steadily on ancient here-and-gone-again tracks and through pasture studded with hidden marmot burrows into larch forest spongy underfoot from endless seasons of fallen needles.\nDuring the 20km, seven-hour ascent, I encountered only a handful of other walkers and no more than a smattering of isolated homes. Snow continued to lie knee-deep in gullies just beside the marked route and the silence of the surroundings was only broken by the occasional few bars of birdsong until I reached the relative energy of Italy's Val Formazza, the location of the first Walser settlements south of the Alps.\nThrough their ongoing migrations, the Walser were the first to inhabit the region permanently, turning hunting areas and summer pasture into year-round settlements formed primary of smallholdings. Its arguably the region's continued isolation – the Val Formazza's village of Crampiolo still can't be reached by road and can be cut off for months over winter due to heavy snowfall – that has helped Walser culture to survive for so long.\nDespite being socially conservative at heart, their migrations resulted in freedoms almost revolutionary for the period. In exchange for permanently settling the upper slopes, the Walser were able to obtain several new customary rights from landowners that most societies lacked. Called Walserrecht, they included full liberty from feudalism, the entitlement to pass inheritance on to heirs and the establishment of \"mayors\" elected by their communities to enforce law and order, something usually done by landlords elsewhere in Switzerland at that time. Their migrations also led to inventions such as the Rittbrätt, a forerunner of the snowboard.\nTypical of the small Walser settlements I passed through was Riale, known in Walsertitsch as Chärbach. Here, I counted no more than a dozen buildings and a hilltop chapel wedded to the flat ground of the River Toce's narrow floodplain and hemmed in by peaks still capped with snow. Each was a solidly built blockbau construction with a roof of heavy roughhewn tiles shaped from local gneiss rock.\nRiale had an almost-abandoned air so early in the hiking season, with just a couple of dog walkers and a single parked car. Even so, its two small guesthouses advertised menus packed with calorie-laden Walser specialities for energy-expending smallholders, such as Bettelmatt (a type of hard cow's milk cheese), gnocchi Walser (potato gnocchi with bacon) and Prata Hapfla (potato pancakes). It was hard to find businesses that weren't keeping Walser culture alive.\nIt was equally hard to conceive of there being any route out of valley over the mountains, given that I was hemmed in on either side with slopes seemingly too steep to tackle. Yet as early as the 13th Century, the Walser did just that, crossing the Alps to the east of Val Formazza via the Hendar Furggu Pass to found Bosco Gurin.\nTheir migration to the only German-speaking settlement in Switzerland's Italian-majority canton of Ticino, is echoed by stage five of the Walserweg Gottardo.\nTo counter the precipitous inclines, the stage had me zigzagging from Val Formazza through shady larch forest. The trees opened out into Alpine pasture and onto the shores of Lake Superiore, reflecting nearby peaks in its still waters and sending a glacial chill through the air. Bosco Gurin's Walserhaus ethnographic museum, housed in one of the oldest surviving structures in the Alps, dating to 1386, came into view several hours of uninterrupted walking later.\nMore like this:• A new chance to hike Europe's ancient salt route• An award-winning 1,400km hike into the wilds of Eastern Europe• France's centuries-old mountain farm stays\nWaiting for me as I tackled the last steps of the stage along flagstones forming the village's pedestrian-only paths, polished with generations of wear, were Tomamichel and the Walserhaus's curator, Cristina Lessman Della Pietra, both of whom come from Walser families.\nSpeaking with passion, their pride in their unique cultural heritage was obvious, but they were also very aware that it's at risk of vanishing. The reason the museum was founded was to \"assure Walser history by gathering everything in one place\", Lessman Della Pietra said. Founded in 1938 by an association of Walser people, its rooms are packed with everyday articles that are now anything but every day, from hand-carved cradles to an antique loom still used by a colleague of Tomamichel and Lessman Della Pietra to make cloth.\nFor many, it's the language that defines the Walser, given the limited intelligibility between Walsertitsch, Swiss German speakers and Standard German speakers due to hundreds of years of the Walser's isolated living. \"The language is an aspect that is going to disappear,\" warned Tomamichel. \"She [Cristina] speaks it but I don't even if I grew up here because my mum was from Ticino, from another village where they spoke Italian.\"\nCompounding the issue is contemporary migration, as Walser families move away from their traditional settlements to find greater opportunities in larger towns and cities. \"I can imagine that many people, if they have to choose between an easy life and cultural values, they choose the easy life,\" conceded Tomamichel. Where Bosco Gurin was home to 400 permanent residents in the mid-19th Century, today there are 50.\nThe hope is that the creation of the Walserweg Gottardo and the arrival of hikers will help maintain the Walser's culture for years to come by providing new employment opportunities that encourage Walser people to stay. The presence of several young families, including Tomamichel's, gives hope for the future of Walser settlements like Bosco Gurin.\n\"I care about my culture, my roots,\" Tomamichel told me. \"I grew up here and it feels natural to maintain it. The Walserweg Gottardo will help us do that.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}
{"id": 530, "question": "What is the name of the dialect spoken by the Walser people?", "answer": ["Walsertitsch"], "doc": ["Additionally, the dialect serves as a marker of cultural identity for the Walser communities. An example of a word unique to Walser German is 'Chlepfer', meaning a small bell. This word, and others like it, reflect the agrarian lifestyle of the Walser communities and their close relationship with the alpine environment.", "These efforts underscore the importance of the dialect not just as a communication tool but as an integral part of the Walser identity. One notable initiative is the use of the Walser Dialect in local schools, where it is taught as a subject to young students.", "Additionally, Walser communities are reportedly found in Haute-Savoie, France (Vallorcine, in the Chablais), where the local Walser dialect is no longer spoken, and in the Berner Oberland (or Bernese Highlands), Switzerland (Grimseljoch-Sustenpass area, Lauterbrunnen, Mürren, etc.", "Here are some key features: Many Walser communities still celebrate traditional festivals where you can hear the Walser Dialect being spoken. These features signify the Walser Dialect as a link to the past, offering insights into medieval Germanic linguistics and the historical movements of the Walser people.", "The formation of the Walser Dialect is intimately linked to the historical migration of the Walser people. Originating from the Swiss canton of Valais, these hardy settlers ventured into the high mountain valleys of the Alps, spreading across what are now Switzerland, Italy, Austria, and Liechtenstein.", "Crossing the High Alps through Switzerland and Italy, this 210km hiking route unravels some of the region's most intriguing human history.\nAs I stopped to rest, the deep tolling of cow bells echoed across Alpine meadows bright with the blooms of wildflowers. I took in a lungful of fresh mountain air, half-wondering how on earth the Walser people managed to walk this same steep trail with their livestock and worldly possessions, and pushed further along the ancient mule track that led up and out of the Binna Valley beyond the tiny hamlet of Fald.\nI was in Switzerland to tackle the first stages of the newly inaugurated 210km Walserweg Gottardo long-distance hiking trail, which officially opened in May 2024.

Venturing further east towards the 1st arrondissement, Damas suggests visiting the Astier de Villate artisanal workshop; \"a great place to find amazing ceramics.\" Astier de Villate's ceramics are all handmade in Paris, and the shop also sells fragrances, artisanal stationery and handsome art books.\nDamas is just as well-known for her sophisticated \"French girl\" beauty as she is for her fashion sense. \"I often wear what I call my 'uniform',\" she said. \"A very simple outfit. I highlight it with a big red lip or add a touch of fantasy with an accessory like a flower hair clip.\"\nHer love for the seemingly effortless \"big red lip\" is evident in her clean beauty line, Les Filles en Rouje, which offers a variety of lipsticks and gorgeous makeup palettes as well as luxury skincare. The line is available through Damas' boutique and at her pick for beauty shopping, Oh My Cream, a French concept shop specialising in green beauty. Oh My Cream has several locations throughout Paris and sells a wide variety of eco-friendly brands, as well as luxe beauty tools and supplements.\nFor extravagant Italian fragrance and bath products, Damas also visits the Santa Maria Novella counter at Le Bon Marché, where she snaps up the melograno in scented terracotta home fragrance diffuser, which she likes for its spicy, pomegranate notes.\nWhen it comes to buying for others, Damas likes to present her loved ones with books. Luckily, the famously literary city of Paris has no shortage of beautiful librairies (bookstores), like the beloved independent bookstore and event space Ofr in Le Marais. \"You can always find a good present,\" said Damas of the neighbourhood mainstay that's known for drawing a hip literary crowd. \"They have a beautiful selection of art books and essays.\"\nWhen Damas wants to browse for literature, she heads to the historic English-language bookshop, Shakespeare and Company; the epicentre for 20th-Century literary luminaries like Ernest Hemingway, Allen Ginsberg and Henry Miller. \"[It's] one of the most beautiful bookshops in Paris,\" she said.\nThe birthplace of legendary jewellers Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, Paris is a jewellery lovers' mecca. Shoppers can browse one-of-a-kind sparkly souvenirs at the extravagant counters in Paris' department stores, or up-and-coming artisanal boutiques helmed by contemporary Parisian jewellery designers. Damas’ is a fan of the sculptural, edgy designs by Charlotte Chesnais at her boutiques in Rive Gauche and Rive Droit, which double as contemporary art spaces. \n\"I can't speak for everybody,\" said Damas. \"But for me personally [Parisian style] has to do a lot with simplicity.\"\n \nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n---\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

He has since become the host of the hit TV show Cuisine Ouverte and has served the likes of Timothée Chalamet, Forest Whitaker, and President Emmanuel Macron. At MoSuke, Chef Mory mixes French staples with West African and Japanese cuisine.", "Christened with the playful moniker \"the billionaire's chef\" due to his clientele of prominent international figures (including the likes of Emmanuel Macron and Lauryn Hill), Erogbogbo has founded contemporary West African eateries across Nigeria and Los Angeles, but he has never forgotten the familiar, delicious comfort of yam, or its important symbolism.", "Delicious, nutritious yam is revered by Nigerians worldwide in festivals and cultural rites. But its legacy is evolving; today's Nigerian chefs are cooking it in brand new ways.\nAcross Nigeria and its global diaspora, one crop reigns supreme: the yam. Resembling logs with their cylindrical shape and thick bark-like skins, yams have fuelled Nigerian and wider West African communities for millennia. However, the humble yam is far more than just a nutritional source. Revered at New Yam festivals, central to ancient oral storytelling traditions and a key component of many cultural rites, yam is not only integral to local cuisine; it weaves together the vibrant and intricate tapestry of the country's cultural identity.\nBut yam's legacy is evolving; today's Nigerian chefs worldwide are honouring the root vegetable with traditional and experimental approaches alike. \n\"Yam really is the king of crops!\" said chef Tolu Erogbogbo, when I asked him about his childhood memories of the starchy, ivory-fleshed tuber. Christened with the playful moniker \"the billionaire's chef\" due to his clientele of prominent international figures (including the likes of Emmanuel Macron and Lauryn Hill), Erogbogbo has founded contemporary West African eateries across Nigeria and Los Angeles, but he has never forgotten the familiar, delicious comfort of yam, or its important symbolism. \"On Sundays we'd always have egg sauce, served with lovely soft yam,\" he said, recalling the beloved Nigerian breakfast where scrambled eggs are stewed with tomatoes and sweet red peppers; mixed with salty fresh or tinned fish (or corned beef); and then seasoned with onions, a tricolour of local chillies and dried local spices like the fiery Cameroon pepper.\nThe jiggling heap of scrambled eggs, made juicy by the tomatoes, is perfectly complemented by the mellow sweetness of fluffy boiled yam. But as Erogbogbo explained, the dish, known simply as \"yam and egg sauce\", is not just a weekend treat. \"It's all about ushering in a positive new week,\" he said. \"This is because yam symbolises wealth and prosperity.\"  \nThis important symbolism is why yam tubers can still be found piled high amidst the pomp and pageantry of Nigerian weddings worldwide, where they represent abundance. Yam also represents fertility; Nigeria's high twin birth rate is believed by many locals to be due to high levels of yam consumption. Indeed, yam is a constant presence in Nigerian folktales, such as that of the Ìrókò tree spirit who women beseeched with yams to cure infertility, a story that left me wide-eyed whenever my mother sang it to me as a child before bed. Yam's cultural significance continues in the plethora of allegorical proverbs across Nigerian cultures that are used to pass down cultural norms and wisdom. I won't be the only Ẹ̀gbọ́n (title for older sibling) who was reminded of my responsibilities with the Yorùbá language adage, \"a bachelor who roasts his yam shares it with his sheep\" – one should always look after their own.\nThe veneration of yams is most deeply seen and felt at Nigeria's annual yam festivals. Between June and October, as the rainy season ebbs, many of Nigeria's several hundred ethnic groups commemorate the harvest of new yams. From Leboku, the multi-week extravaganza held by the Yakurr people of Cross River State, to Odun Ijesu among the Yorùbás of Ikere-Ekiti in south-western Nigeria, most festivities involve frenetic masquerades, thunderous choruses of prayer, kaleidoscopic parades and plenty of synchronised dance and drumming.\nThese performances honour agricultural and fertility deities, but some rites have evolved to incorporate Christian worship in the wake of colonialism and globalisation. While there are many parallels between the celebrations, region-specific nuances set the festivals apart. For instance, in the town of Ogidi, Kogi State, you'll find Yorùbá bata dancers decked in indigo-dyed àdìrẹ garments and traditional female drummers singing oríkì (praise poetry), their bodies wrapped in a rainbow of handwoven aṣọ òkè cloth.\nA particularly prominent New Yam Festival is Iri Ji (Igbo for \"new yam eating\"). To ward off misfortune, all yams from the previous harvest must be consumed before tucking into the new bounty. Iri Ji is not only celebrated in Igboland (Southeastern Nigeria); from America to Poland, Igbo communities gather in town halls and community centres to commemorate the new harvest. Alongside modern developments such as online streaming and TikTok vlogs of the celebrations, ancient rituals remain, such as enjoying smoky roasted yam with fresh West African palm oil – as red and glossy as stained glass.\nBut as sacred as yam is to Nigerian identity and folklore, the most enduring yam ritual will forever be simply eating it.\n\"Yam is extremely versatile. It can be pounded, boiled, fried, roasted… there are so many ways to enjoy it,\" said restaurateur Aji Akokomi, explaining the inclusion of yams on the ever-changing menu at his restaurant Akoko, a West African fine-dining restaurant in London that was awarded its first Michelin star this year. \"At Akoko, we've made yam croquettes topped with truffles, and we're adding pounded yam with egusi soup and monkfish.\"\nYam dishes are also found at Akara, Akokomi's more casual sibling restaurant. \"There we make yams into this delicious sauce served with barbecued pork and fermented scotch bonnet.\" \nMore like this:• West Africa’s Michelin-starred cuisine wows London• A West African ode to a spicy and tangy chicken dish• Ube: the Filipino tuber taking over the world\nSubtly scented, yam is well-suited to complementing more robust flavours, making it an apt canvas for chefs to showcase creativity and technical flair. For Adenike Adefila, a chef at the first fine-dining pan-African restaurant in Abuja, The Burgundy, yam is the perfect indigenous vessel for applying techniques from her French and Italian culinary training. For instance, she forms yam into pillowy gnocchi served with a rich tomato relish finished with cream. \"We also layer very thinly sliced yam and soak it overnight in whey with cardamom and ehuru (calabash nutmeg),\" she said, explaining the process behind her yam gratin. Served with a velvety palm nut béchamel and sautéed spinach, it's a clever take on the traditional pairing of yam with fresh red palm oil.\nYam ingenuity continues at Chishuru in London, where chef Adejoké Bakare, the first black woman in the UK to be awarded a Michelin star, has served her take on àsáró; a Yorùbá pottage of sweet yam stewed and mashed into a spiced tomato and red pepper reduction served with smoked eel and purple sprouting broccoli.\nBack in the US, yam is also creatively woven into Erogbogbo's mission to \"really put Nigerian cuisine on the map in LA\", marrying his business school acumen and culinary passions at his private dining studio ILÉ (Yorùbá for \"home\"). His innovations include yam dumplings served with a deconstructed ẹ̀fọ́ riro; aromatic braised greens with chillies and umami-filled fermented locust beans. There's also a twist on the traditional combination of pounded yam and egusi, the nutty, intensely savoury stew made from ground native gourd seeds: a yam mousse with a buttery, mustard-yellow egusi sauce.  \nWhile these reinvented yam dishes put a fresh spin on the vegetable's role in Nigerian cuisine and culture, Yewande Komolafe, author of seminal Nigerian cookbook My Everyday Lagos told me, \"traditional yam dishes are perfect just as they are\". From ofe nsala (white soup), an Eastern Nigerian delicacy thickened with yam, brimming with fresh seafood and sprinkled with ribbons of fresh bitter uziza leaves, to ojojo, crispy and moreish Yorùbá water yam fritters, to ukodo, an Urhobo one-pot-wonder of yam chunks, green plantain and meat simmering in a full-bodied, sinus-clearing broth, time-honoured yam recipes are cherished across Nigeria and beyond.\nBut for now, even with avant-garde recipes and modernised cultural practices, yam remains an unbroken thread connecting generations of Nigerians with their ancestors. \nCrushed Yam Fritters\nBy Yewande Komolafe\nServes 8-10\nCooked yams or a leftover pot of àsáró (yam porridge) can be repurposed as yam fritters to serve as a 'small chop' (Nigerian Pidgin for a snack or appetiser). This recipe is as easy as it gets, made both rich and refreshing by the addition of ata dín dín (bell pepper sauce) and fresh spring onions. The garri (cassava flour)-dusted crust is my recommendation, but you can also use breadcrumbs or panko for this step.

{"id": 540, "question": "What dish is traditionally served with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, and sweet red peppers in Nigerian cuisine?", "answer": ["Yam and egg sauce"], "doc": ["\"On Sundays we'd always have egg sauce, served with lovely soft yam,\" he said, recalling the beloved Nigerian breakfast where scrambled eggs are stewed with tomatoes and sweet red peppers; mixed with salty fresh or tinned fish (or corned beef); and then seasoned with onions, a tricolour of local chillies and dried local spices like the fiery Cameroon pepper.", "The staple of every Nigerian meal plan is the classic red stew, made by blending red peppers, tomatoes and onion. Add in your preferred meat substitute for a delicious dish best served with rice, yam, plantain, potatoes, and more! Click here for the recipe. Can best be described as a steamed bean pudding.", "While I was growing up, breakfast on Sundays would be bread or yam with egg sauce; this is still a tradition in many households to date. To make Nigerian egg sauce, the egg is cooked in tomatoes, pepper and onion sauce with spices. It can be served with yam, bread (it is excellent with Agege bread), potatoes, plantain or rice.", "The final dish is served with a topper – a medley of chopped tomatoes, cucumber, red onions, fresh parsley and coriander dressed in olive oil and lime juice. Serve Ful Medames with either boiled or fried eggs with a side of fluffy pitta bread or Sesame and Nigella Seed Flatbread (as pictured above) and tahini to drizzle over as well.", "This ancient breakfast dish, originating in Egypt and then migrating to other countries such as Lebanon, Iraq, Ethiopia, Sudan and Morocco, is traditionally made by mashing fava beans cooked with cumin and then serving with olive oil, garlic, lemon juice and chopped fresh parsley.", "Delicious, nutritious yam is revered by Nigerians worldwide in festivals and cultural rites. But its legacy is evolving; today's Nigerian chefs are cooking it in brand new ways.\nAcross Nigeria and its global diaspora, one crop reigns supreme: the yam. Resembling logs with their cylindrical shape and thick bark-like skins, yams have fuelled Nigerian and wider West African communities for millennia. However, the humble yam is far more than just a nutritional source. Revered at New Yam festivals, central to ancient oral storytelling traditions and a key component of many cultural rites, yam is not only integral to local cuisine; it weaves together the vibrant and intricate tapestry of the country's cultural identity.\nBut yam's legacy is evolving; today's Nigerian chefs worldwide are honouring the root vegetable with traditional and experimental approaches alike. \n\"Yam really is the king of crops!\" said chef Tolu Erogbogbo, when I asked him about his childhood memories of the starchy, ivory-fleshed tuber. Christened with the playful moniker \"the billionaire's chef\" due to his clientele of prominent international figures (including the likes of Emmanuel Macron and Lauryn Hill), Erogbogbo has founded contemporary West African eateries across Nigeria and Los Angeles, but he has never forgotten the familiar, delicious comfort of yam, or its important symbolism. \"On Sundays we'd always have egg sauce, served with lovely soft yam,\" he said, recalling the beloved Nigerian breakfast where scrambled eggs are stewed with tomatoes and sweet red peppers; mixed with salty fresh or tinned fish (or corned beef); and then seasoned with onions, a tricolour of local chillies and dried local spices like the fiery Cameroon pepper.\nThe jiggling heap of scrambled eggs, made juicy by the tomatoes, is perfectly complemented by the mellow sweetness of fluffy boiled yam. But as Erogbogbo explained, the dish, known simply as \"yam and egg sauce\", is not just a weekend treat. \"It's all about ushering in a positive new week,\" he said. \"This is because yam symbolises wealth and prosperity.\"  \nThis important symbolism is why yam tubers can still be found piled high amidst the pomp and pageantry of Nigerian weddings worldwide, where they represent abundance. Yam also represents fertility; Nigeria's high twin birth rate is believed by many locals to be due to high levels of yam consumption. Indeed, yam is a constant presence in Nigerian folktales, such as that of the Ìrókò tree spirit who women beseeched with yams to cure infertility, a story that left me wide-eyed whenever my mother sang it to me as a child before bed. Yam's cultural significance continues in the plethora of allegorical proverbs across Nigerian cultures that are used to pass down cultural norms and wisdom. I won't be the only Ẹ̀gbọ́n (title for older sibling) who was reminded of my responsibilities with the Yorùbá language adage, \"a bachelor who roasts his yam shares it with his sheep\" – one should always look after their own.\nThe veneration of yams is most deeply seen and felt at Nigeria's annual yam festivals. Between June and October, as the rainy season ebbs, many of Nigeria's several hundred ethnic groups commemorate the harvest of new yams. From Leboku, the multi-week extravaganza held by the Yakurr people of Cross River State, to Odun Ijesu among the Yorùbás of Ikere-Ekiti in south-western Nigeria, most festivities involve frenetic masquerades, thunderous choruses of prayer, kaleidoscopic parades and plenty of synchronised dance and drumming.\nThese performances honour agricultural and fertility deities, but some rites have evolved to incorporate Christian worship in the wake of colonialism and globalisation. While there are many parallels between the celebrations, region-specific nuances set the festivals apart. For instance, in the town of Ogidi, Kogi State, you'll find Yorùbá bata dancers decked in indigo-dyed àdìrẹ garments and traditional female drummers singing oríkì (praise poetry), their bodies wrapped in a rainbow of handwoven aṣọ òkè cloth.\nA particularly prominent New Yam Festival is Iri Ji (Igbo for \"new yam eating\"). To ward off misfortune, all yams from the previous harvest must be consumed before tucking into the new bounty. Iri Ji is not only celebrated in Igboland (Southeastern Nigeria); from America to Poland, Igbo communities gather in town halls and community centres to commemorate the new harvest. Alongside modern developments such as online streaming and TikTok vlogs of the celebrations, ancient rituals remain, such as enjoying smoky roasted yam with fresh West African palm oil – as red and glossy as stained glass.\nBut as sacred as yam is to Nigerian identity and folklore, the most enduring yam ritual will forever be simply eating it.\n\"Yam is extremely versatile. It can be pounded, boiled, fried, roasted… there are so many ways to enjoy it,\" said restaurateur Aji Akokomi, explaining the inclusion of yams on the ever-changing menu at his restaurant Akoko, a West African fine-dining restaurant in London that was awarded its first Michelin star this year. \"At Akoko, we've made yam croquettes topped with truffles, and we're adding pounded yam with egusi soup and monkfish.\"\nYam dishes are also found at Akara, Akokomi's more casual sibling restaurant. \"There we make yams into this delicious sauce served with barbecued pork and fermented scotch bonnet.\" \nMore like this:• West Africa’s Michelin-starred cuisine wows London• A West African ode to a spicy and tangy chicken dish• Ube: the Filipino tuber taking over the world\nSubtly scented, yam is well-suited to complementing more robust flavours, making it an apt canvas for chefs to showcase creativity and technical flair. For Adenike Adefila, a chef at the first fine-dining pan-African restaurant in Abuja, The Burgundy, yam is the perfect indigenous vessel for applying techniques from her French and Italian culinary training. For instance, she forms yam into pillowy gnocchi served with a rich tomato relish finished with cream. \"We also layer very thinly sliced yam and soak it overnight in whey with cardamom and ehuru (calabash nutmeg),\" she said, explaining the process behind her yam gratin. Served with a velvety palm nut béchamel and sautéed spinach, it's a clever take on the traditional pairing of yam with fresh red palm oil.\nYam ingenuity continues at Chishuru in London, where chef Adejoké Bakare, the first black woman in the UK to be awarded a Michelin star, has served her take on àsáró; a Yorùbá pottage of sweet yam stewed and mashed into a spiced tomato and red pepper reduction served with smoked eel and purple sprouting broccoli.\nBack in the US, yam is also creatively woven into Erogbogbo's mission to \"really put Nigerian cuisine on the map in LA\", marrying his business school acumen and culinary passions at his private dining studio ILÉ (Yorùbá for \"home\"). His innovations include yam dumplings served with a deconstructed ẹ̀fọ́ riro; aromatic braised greens with chillies and umami-filled fermented locust beans. There's also a twist on the traditional combination of pounded yam and egusi, the nutty, intensely savoury stew made from ground native gourd seeds: a yam mousse with a buttery, mustard-yellow egusi sauce.  \nWhile these reinvented yam dishes put a fresh spin on the vegetable's role in Nigerian cuisine and culture, Yewande Komolafe, author of seminal Nigerian cookbook My Everyday Lagos told me, \"traditional yam dishes are perfect just as they are\". From ofe nsala (white soup), an Eastern Nigerian delicacy thickened with yam, brimming with fresh seafood and sprinkled with ribbons of fresh bitter uziza leaves, to ojojo, crispy and moreish Yorùbá water yam fritters, to ukodo, an Urhobo one-pot-wonder of yam chunks, green plantain and meat simmering in a full-bodied, sinus-clearing broth, time-honoured yam recipes are cherished across Nigeria and beyond.\nBut for now, even with avant-garde recipes and modernised cultural practices, yam remains an unbroken thread connecting generations of Nigerians with their ancestors. \nCrushed Yam Fritters\nBy Yewande Komolafe\nServes 8-10\nCooked yams or a leftover pot of àsáró (yam porridge) can be repurposed as yam fritters to serve as a 'small chop' (Nigerian Pidgin for a snack or appetiser).

Opened in 1925, it is one of the oldest and best known pizzerias in the United States.", "[4] His grandfather was a baker, while his parents owned a restaurant called Osteria Pizzeria Pepe in Piazza Porta Vetere in Caiazzo, town of almost 6,000 inhabitants in the Campania region, near Naples. This is where Franco Pepe learned the trade by working as a pizza maker with his brothers.", "Franco Pepe (born July 18, 1963, in Caiazzo)[citation needed] is an Italian award winning pizzaiolo, internationally recognized as one of the best in the world.[1][2] He is the owner of Pepe In Grani restaurant in Caiazzo, Italy,[3] and is featured in one of the episodes of Netflix's docu-series Chef's Table: Pizza.", "[10] Frank Pepe passed away in 1969. His two daughters took over the ownership and operation of the pizzeria. Like their parents, Elizabeth and Serafina made running the restaurant the center of their lives.", "A few days before Christmas I returned to Pepe in Grani, Franco Pepe’s pizza villa in the hilltop village of Caiazzo, with the intention of catching the world’s most acclaimed pizza maker off guard. On the drive up from Naples I rehearsed in my head the confession I would deliver to Franco prior to a pizza-tasting dinner.", "The award-winning pizza maker of Pepe in Grani honed his craft in Naples. Here are his Neapolitan culinary favourites, from Chalet Ciro to Mimì alla Ferrovia.\nItaly's seaside city of Naples is the birthplace of pizza, with proto versions of the tomato and mozzarella-smothered flatbread hitting the cobblestoned streets as early as 1738. But in the 1990s, long before he created what has been voted the world's best pizza, chef Franco Pepe was pounding the city's pavements to learn the great Neapolitan pizza making arts.\n\"I have a wonderful personal relationship with Naples,\" says Pepe, now the eponymous owner of the global sensation Pepe in Grani pizzeria in his hometown of Caiazzo, 50km outside the city; famed for his mastery and innovation. \"My time there was crucial to my pizza making career. Spending time with Neapolitan pizza masters... soaking up the pizza-making culture... witnessing the birth of the disciplinare (the official AVPN regulations defining \"True Neapolitan Pizza\"). That experience helped me develop my own pizza. For me, Naples symbolises my youth.\"\nThough iconic among Italian cities, Naples is often overlooked by overseas tourists in favour of Rome, Florence and Venice. But Pepe loves returning to his old stomping grounds. \"You experience colours, music, and, yes, okay, confusion,\" he admits, alluding to the city's notoriously chaotic traffic and jumbled lasagna layers of Ancient Greco-Roman, Spanish, Norman, Bourbon and Baroque architecture. \"But also, art, history and beauty. Spending a day there is magical.\"\nPepe's favourite way to experience the city is to wade through the graffiti-streaked side streets of its 3,000 year-old centro storico (historic centre) – \"It's vivacious; you see how Neapolitans really live\" – and stroll down the Mergellina seafront, a 2.5km stretch of rocky coastline hugging the Gulf of Naples, facing the humpbacked Mt Vesuvius: \"Like walking through history.\"\nWhen asked for his top Neapolitan dishes, Pepe is quick to note: \"Neapolitan food isn't just pizza; there's an amazing cuisine using products, which I also use on my pizza, that you can't find anywhere else in the world, cultivated in the volcanic soil of Vesuvius.

Among other things, it details the level of compensation to be paid if a man lets his dog chase another man's sheep; takes grazing land away from a neighbour's flock; or drives a wild sheep into another shepherd's herd, thus disturbing the \"calmer\" animals.  \nI spent a year living in these sparsely populated islands, and I never felt lonely when wandering by myself through the dark green mountains, since there were almost always sheep within view. For more than a millennium, these hardy, tangle-haired creatures have grazed the slopes clear of most vegetation apart from grass, physically sculpting the dramatic landscape of this remote, windswept nation and shaping the country's identity.\nMarooned in the North Atlantic between Scotland and Iceland, the Faroes' 18 volcanic islands are effectively a far-flung, supercharged slice of Scandinavia. They're home to traditional wood-built houses topped with turf and the kind of lightning-fast, near-universal wi-fi you might expect from other Nordic nations, but also thundering waterfalls, sharp cliffs and jaw-dropping fjords that are leading a record-breaking number of travellers to visit in 2024.\nFirst inhabited by Irish monks in the 6th Century CE and permanently settled by Vikings in the 9th Century, today the Faroe Islands are an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. The 54,000 islanders speak their own language, Faroese, which is very closely related to Old Norse. And in case there's any doubt about how crucial the islands' sure-footed sheep are to its national identity, one only has to look at its name in Faroese: Føroyar (the Sheep Islands).\nRecent studies suggest that sheep have inhabited the Faroe Islands ever since the first Irish settlers landed here. When the Vikings showed up centuries later, they named the islands after these northern European short-tailed sheep they found living here. Ever since in this rugged, remote land, the rearing of semi-wild sheep for meat and wool (alongside fishing, whaling and hunting sea birds) has been key to survival for more than a millennium.\nFlocks were traditionally sailed to specific parts of the islands and, then as now, they are usually communally owned. Most Faroese families still have a share in a flock somewhere, and many people – whether they be doctors, lawyers, tradesmen or teachers – will turn out during the autumn roundup to help with the slaughter and divide the meat fairly. And today, nearly every Faroese family still keeps a leg of fermented lamb in the larder all year long.\nVisitors to the Faroes will see these doe-eyed creatures everywhere – sometimes even in the car park of the islands' only airport – happily grazing on roundabouts or munching on the grass roofs of old Faroese buildings. In fact, the islands' 70,000 Faroese sheep easily outnumber the Faroese human population.\nThe Faroes are buffeted by some of the strongest winds in Europe and rain is likely up to 300 days per year. Not much can be grown in this thin soil: a few potatoes, turnips, some carrots and rhubarb are the main crops here. As a result, fermented lamb and mutton are dietary staples. This pungent food (known as skerpikjøt) is shaped by the Faroes' unique windy-but-never-too-cold-nor-too-warm climate.\nMore like this: • An epic road trip over and under the Atlantic Ocean • The Faroe Islands' 500-year-old fight to save its language • Iceland's original 'green' buildings\nAfter the autumn slaughter, the meat is hung in sheds called hjallur where it slowly dries and is colonised by a layer of bacteria. The meat acquires a strong cheesy flavour, passing through several stages – moist (ræst), dry (turt) and finally fermented (skerpi). According to Jógvan Páll Fjallsbak, a microbiologist at the Faroes' Food Science and Veterinary Agency, it is the rapid growth of bacteria on the meat's surface that produces its distinctive blackened appearance.\n\"We know there are more than 600 species of bacteria identified on the surface of the meat,\" he explained. \"But we still don't fully understand the chemical processes that affect the final taste of the meat. It varies according to humidity and air temperature. Some people say they can tell which island the meat has come from by the taste.\"\nIt's not only the meat that matters. There's an old saying in Faroese; \"Ull er Føroya gull\", meaning \"Wool is Faroes' gold\". Traditional Faroese knitwear still makes good use of the thick hairy yarn, and knitting clubs are found in every village. Most locals wear the distinctive Faroese hand-knitted jumpers all year round.\nIn a country named after them, it's perhaps natural that sheep have become something of a national symbol. The logo of the national tourism board is a ram's head. One of the country's most popular beer brands is Black Sheep. In the centre of Tórshavn – home to 40% of the island's population and eight of the nation's nine traffic lights – you will see a bronze statue of a ram. The horns shine where the metal has been rubbed smooth by children who love to come and sit on his back. Created by Faroese sculptor Rógvi Hansen, it is just one of several sheep monuments in the capital, including a group of stylised steel sheep munching the grass outside the Nordic House Cultural Centre.\nAside from feeding the Faroese, clothing them and mowing their roofs, sheep have also provided other civic services over the years. To help raise its tourist profile and, as the Nordic Council of Ministers put it, \"introduce the Faroe Islands to the world\", the Faroese government created a series of films in 2016 made by camera-carrying sheep. They called their Google Street View parody Sheep View, and officials say it resulted in a massive upswing in tourism awareness for the islands.\n\"We hoped people would see the funny side of Sheep View, and with a relatively small budget, we thought it might be the kind of unusual idea that would capture peoples' imaginations,\" said Guðrið Højgaard, CEO of Visit Faroe Islands. \"We do value our sheep and they are such an important part of our national identity that it seemed very fitting to make them famous around the world. I happen to think our sheep are rather pretty too.\"\nMeanwhile, Høgni Reistrup, who runs the local tour agency Guide to the Faroe Islands reports that they often receive requests from around the world for \"sheep-related itineraries\".\n\"I have had clients from other countries where sheep culture is important, like New Zealand and Australia, asking if we can supply a guide who can take them to a farm to meet a Faroese shepherd, and even to join in with the autumn roundup. It's a very photogenic time of year,\" Reistrup said.\nTourists can also sample dishes made with the islands' famous fermented lamb at restaurants in Tórshavn – notably at Ræst, located close to the harbour. Some farmers also offer traditional food experiences under the home-dining scheme known as heimablidni (home hospitality), while sheep farmer Jákup Petersen offers guided hikes on his land near the village of Kaldbak, where visitors trek to a mountain hut to sample wind-dried skerpikjøt mutton made from his own sheep.\nEva ur Dímun is the eighth generation of her family to farm sheep on the small Faroese island of Stóra Dímun, where she lives all alone with her husband JógvanJón and their roughly 500 sheep.\n\"I admire these animals, they are so tough, and not boring creatures as many people may think,\" ur Dímun told me, after an exhausting day rounding up the flock on the island's steep slopes. \"We use a lot of energy running after the sheep, and cannot survive here without food and shelter. I feel a bit inferior when I think about how well-adapted they are to surviving in this place, They produce lambs and survive all winter on just a diet of grass, and they can withstand wind and rain and snow.\"\nTo understand just how these hardy creatures learned to adapt to the Faroes' unique climate, visitors can head to Tórshavn National Museum, where a glass display case contains a little family of three brown taxidermied sheep. They are much smaller and less woolly than today's Faroese sheep, and they were captured in the late 19th Century on the uninhabited island of Lítla Dímun, just a few miles across the sea from where ur Dímun farms. They are the last-known examples of the original Faroese breed the Vikings discovered on the islands when they arrived in roughly 800 CE. Larger and heavier varieties from Scotland, Iceland and Norway replaced the native breed in the 19th Century to provide more meat and better-quality wool.  \nFrom Viking settlers to Danish landlords to modern travellers, wave after wave of settlers have blown into the Faroes with the winds over the years. But through it all, the hardy sheep has remained, sculpting the land, shaping a nation and humbly forging the Faroes' unique identity.\nTim Ecott is a former BBC World Service correspondent and the author of the book The Land of Maybe: A Faroe Islands Year.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."]}

Set in a Gaeltacht, (Irish-speaking district) the city is especially enjoying a resurgence of traditional Irish music – known locally as \"trad\", a name that gives the genre a hipster cool, far from its humble origins as tunes played in kitchens and street corners.\nWe asked Galway native Enda Scahill, one of Ireland's foremost banjo players, to help us find his hometown's best trad music sessions. At just 11 years old, Scahill was performing at pubs packed with tourists eager to experience Ireland's traditional music. \"At the time, there was definitely the perception of Irish music as shamrocks, leprechauns and 'Danny Boy'. But, just like jazz and bluegrass, there are layers upon layers of depth,\" says Scahill. \"Galway is a very small town, but you can catch two sessions a day, every day of the week… Young people proudly play old-time music, and so the quality of musicians at the moment is exceptional. We say, 'If you drop a coin out of a plane over Ireland, you'll no doubt hit a world-class fiddle player'. And banjo players too.\"\nWhen Scahill was a teen, there was one banjo player in the west of Ireland, \"and we'd drive an hour and a half, which was a big deal in rural Ireland in the '80s, what with the bad cars and bad roads\". Now, Irish banjo players are everywhere in the trad music scene, and he's taught a fair share of them.\n\"Everybody wants to come to Galway!\" he says. \"We have a fantastic reputation for fun, food and the amazing scenery of Connemara at our doorstep.\" And all are invited, listener or player. \"The sessions are very welcoming. There's no gatekeeper.\"\nHere are Scahill's favourite places to catch trad music in Galway.\n\"Tig Cóilí is probably the most famous pub in Galway,\" says Scahill. Despite its prime spot at the car-free crossroads of Mainguard and Shop Streets, this cosy pub has a country tavern feel.\nUS dollar bills, police badges and framed photos of famous faces – Paul Brady, Sharon Shannon, Dessie O'Halloran, Frankie Gavin and Máirtín O'Connor – cover the walls, giving the pub a well-worn, lived-in charm. \"It looks 100 years old, but I remember, before it became Tig Cóilí, it was a modern-style pub, mostly quiet except for, as people would say, 'swingers at two o'clock in the afternoon,' says Scahill.\nMusicians squeeze into a corner booth by the fire-engine-red windows for two daily sessions. Each session features three core players, with seven or eight others joining in. \"I played their very first session 25 years ago, with the owner's son,\" says Scahill. \"The only real change they've made since then is putting up barriers to stop tourists from falling onto the musicians.\"\nWebsite: www.tigchoiligalway.comAddress: Mainguard St, GalwayPhone: +353 91 561 294Instagram: @tigchoili\nHead out of Tig Cóilí and across the street to Taaffes, the historic stone-fronted pub that's anchored Galway's pub scene for more than 150 years. Owned by the Lally family, Taaffes was a second home to Scahill as a boy.\n\"I was playing there so much in my late teens that my mother would call the bar looking for me,\" he recalls. \"Their Guinness is fantastic, and it's always packed, morning, noon and night.\" Inside, low ceilings and cosy nooks invite lingering.\nSessions happen in a snug at the front; a stage in the back is pulled out for bigger performances.

A Galway institution since 1964, \"it's been in the Monroe family for decades and is now run by Gary Monroe, who's hugely passionate about Irish music, especially trad,\" he says.\nTrad sessions happen nightly, but the standout is Fridays at 16:30. What began a couple of years ago as a casual meet-up has since become one of the best sessions in the city, where a rotating guest joins two core musicians. \"I'll be the third every six weeks or so,\" says Scahill. \"Plus the drop-in musicians; some days, there might be 20. It's always loads of fun.\" At 19:00, Monroe's brother, who runs the tavern's pizza parlour, hands out slices to the players at the session's end.\n\"Gary's built a strong, welcoming community vibe,\" says Scahill. \"There's a guy who owns the biggest garden centre in Galway who comes every week with his double bass.

Then you've got Inishmaan, the middle one – 'maan' means average. Finally, there's Inisheer, since 'sheer' means small.\"\n\"They really put a lot of thought into those names,\" he deadpans.\nOn Inisheer, find Tigh Ned tucked inside a thatched cottage that's been in the Ó Conghaile family since 1897. From April to October, musicians fill the salty air with the sounds of sweet trad. \"It's as 'country pub' as you want on an island.\"\nThe kitchen serves classic pub fare and fresh seafood. Scahill recommends calling ahead to order the crab special. \"Every morning their boats come back filled with these big brown Atlantic crabs.

Then you've got Inishmaan, the middle one – 'maan' means average. Finally, there's Inisheer, since 'sheer' means small.\"\n\"They really put a lot of thought into those names,\" he deadpans.\nOn Inisheer, find Tigh Ned tucked inside a thatched cottage that's been in the Ó Conghaile family since 1897. From April to October, musicians fill the salty air with the sounds of sweet trad. \"It's as 'country pub' as you want on an island.\"\nThe kitchen serves classic pub fare and fresh seafood. Scahill recommends calling ahead to order the crab special. \"Every morning their boats come back filled with these big brown Atlantic crabs. They boil them in the back and serve them with brown bread and butter. It's the most spectacular meal you'll ever have. My son and his friend had it when they were about nine, and years later, they're still talking about it.\"\nWebsite: www.tighned.com Address: Inisheer, Aran Islands, Co.
